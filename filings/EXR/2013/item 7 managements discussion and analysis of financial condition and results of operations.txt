notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report we make statements in this section that are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements see the section in this form 10k entitled statements regarding forwardlooking information certain risk factors may cause actual results performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion for a discussion of such risk factors see the section in this form 10k entitled risk factors amounts in thousands except share and per share data  overview   we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties   at december 31 2012 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 910 operating properties in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 910 operating properties we owned 448 we held joint venture interests in 281 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 181 properties that are owned by third parties these operating properties contain approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 610000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 490000 tenants   our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years   to maximize the performance of our properties we employ stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology and an industryleading revenue management system developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues   we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our whollyowned selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures   we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of our systems  28      table of contents  we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following   maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost   acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value   expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire the properties    during 2012 we acquired 91 whollyowned properties and completed the development of one whollyowned property   critical accounting policies and estimates   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies   consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie   a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the  29      table of contents enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie   we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2012 the company had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated   real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized   expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years   in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred   intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on five properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms   evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections   when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds  30      table of contents the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets   when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented   investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements   under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity   our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment   derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation derivatives used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset liability or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk are considered fair value hedges derivatives used to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions are considered cash flow hedges   for derivatives designated as fair value hedges changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item related to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income outside of earnings and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings   revenue and expense recognition rental revenues are recognized as earned based upon amounts that are currently due from tenants leases are generally on monthtomonth terms prepaid rents are recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the leases promotional discounts are recognized as a reduction to rental income over the promotional period late charges administrative fees merchandise sales and truck rentals are recognized in income when earned management fee revenues are recognized monthly as services are performed and in accordance with the terms of the related management agreements tenant reinsurance premiums are recognized as revenues over the period of insurance coverage equity in earnings of real estate entities is recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate entities interest income is recognized as earned  31      table of contents  property expenses including utilities property taxes repairs and maintenance and other costs to manage the facilities are recognized as incurred we accrue for property tax expense based upon invoice amounts estimates and historical trends if these estimates are incorrect the timing of expense recognition could be affected   income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under sections 856 through 860 of the internal revenue code in order to maintain our qualification as a reit among other things we are required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet certain tests regarding the nature of our income and assets as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax with respect to that portion of our income which meets certain criteria and is distributed annually to our stockholders we plan to continue to operate so that we meet the requirements for taxation as a reit many of these requirements however are highly technical and complex if we were to fail to meet these requirements we would be subject to federal income tax we are subject to certain state and local taxes provision for such taxes has been included in income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations   we have elected to treat one of our corporate subsidiaries extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs in general our trs may perform additional services for tenants and generally may engage in any real estate or nonreal estate related business a trs is subject to corporate federal income tax deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions will be recognized in income tax expense when incurred   recent accounting pronouncements   in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board issued asu no 201202 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment asu 201202 which provides companies with the option to first assess qualitative factors in determining whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired then the entity is not required to take further action however if an entity concludes otherwise then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value previously companies were required to perform the quantitative impairment test at least annually as permitted we adopted these provisions in 2012 the adoption of asu 201202 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations   results of operations   comparison of the year ended december 31 2012 to the year ended december 31 2011   overview   results for the year ended december 31 2012 included the operations of 729 properties 449 of which were consolidated and

we completed the acquisition of 91 properties during 2012 and 55 properties during 2011 in addition revenues increased by 15493 as a result of increases in occupancy and rental rates to existing customers at our stabilized properties we have seen no significant increase in overall customer renewal rates our average length of stay is approximately 13 months for existing customers we seek to increase rental rates approximately 7 to 10 at least annually occupancy at our stabilized properties increased to 878 at december 31 2012 as compared to 858 at december 31 2011 rental rates to new tenants increased by approximately 41 over the same period in the prior year finally revenues at our leaseup properties increased by 5879 as a result of increased occupancy   tenant reinsurancethe

properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements   the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition
