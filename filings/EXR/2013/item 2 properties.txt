    as of december 31 2012 we owned or had ownership interests in 729 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 448 are whollyowned and 281 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 181 properties for third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 910 these properties are located in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2012 we owned andor managed approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 610000 separate storage units approximately 81 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence   we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years   as of december 31 2012 over 490000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 910 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2012 the average length of stay was approximately 13 months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was approximately 1388 at december 31 2012 compared to 1350 at december 31 2011   our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only  20                 table of contents   the following table presents additional
