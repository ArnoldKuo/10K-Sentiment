years charles l allen executive vice president and chief legal officer 15 years and kenneth m woolley executive chairman and chief investment officer 32 years   our executive management team and board of directors have a significant ownership position in the company with executive officers and directors owning approximately 6119889 shares or 55 of our outstanding common stock as of february 15 2013   industry amp competition   selfstorage facilities refers to properties that offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use selfstorage offers a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet properties generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as needed   selfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a selfstorage property is determined by a propertys local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage properties range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goods   our research has shown that tenants choose a selfstorage property based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for selfstorage properties a propertys perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most selfstorage properties are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of time   there are seasonal fluctuations in occupancy rates for selfstorage properties based on our experience generally there is increased leasing activity at selfstorage properties during the spring and summer months the highest level of occupancy is typically at the end of july while the lowest level of occupancy is seen in late february and early march   since inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2002 there were only 35176 selfstorage properties in the united states with an average physical occupancy rate of 854 of net rentable square feet compared to 50859 selfstorage properties in 2012 with an average physical occupancy rate of 797 of net rentable square feet   we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire properties especially for brokered portfolios aggressive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this competition will likely continue  4      table of contents  the industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states owned approximately 114 of total us selfstorage properties and the top 50 selfstorage companies owned approximately 151 of the total us properties as of december 31 2012 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitions given our historical reputation for closing deals   we are the second largest selfstorage operator in the united states we are one of four public selfstorage reits along with public storage inc sovran selfstorage inc and cubesmart   longterm growth and

risks actually occur our business operating results prospects and financial condition could be harmed   our performance is subject to risks associated with real estate investments we are a real estate company that derives our income from operation of our properties there are a number of factors that may adversely affect the income that our properties generate including the following   risks related to our properties and operations   adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we do business could negatively affect our occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore our operating results   our operating results are dependent upon our ability to maximize occupancy levels and rental rates in our selfstorage properties adverse economic or other conditions in the markets in which we operate may lower our occupancy levels and limit our ability to increase rents or require us to offer rental discounts if our properties fail to generate revenues sufficient to meet our cash

events may occur could result in a general decline in rental rates or an increase in tenant defaults  a decline or worsening of the current economic environment  local or regional real estate market conditions such as competing properties the oversupply of selfstorage or a reduction in demand for selfstorage in a particular area  perceptions by prospective users of our selfstorage properties of the safety convenience and attractiveness of our properties and the neighborhoods in which they are located  increased operating costs including the need for capital improvements insurance premiums real estate taxes and utilities  the impact of environmental protection laws  earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters terrorist acts civil disturbances or acts of war which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses and  changes in tax real estate and zoning laws    if we are unable to promptly relet our units or if the rates upon such reletting are significantly lower than expected our business and results of operations would be adversely affected   virtually all of our leases are on a monthtomonth basis any delay in reletting units as vacancies arise would reduce our revenues and harm our operating results in addition lower than expected rental rates upon reletting could adversely affect our revenues and impede our growth   we depend upon our onsite personnel to maximize tenant satisfaction at each of our properties and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performance   we had 1925 field personnel as of february 15 2013 in the management and operation of our properties the general professionalism of our site managers and staff are contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure selfstorage properties if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service we strive to provide at our properties could be adversely affected which could lead to decreased occupancy levels and reduced operating performance   uninsured losses or losses in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our financial condition and our cash flow   we maintain comprehensive liability fire flood earthquake wind as deemed necessary or as required by our lenders extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties certain types of losses however may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable such as losses due to earthquakes hurricanes tornadoes riots acts of war or terrorism should an uninsured loss occur we could lose both our investment in and anticipated profits and cash flow from a property in addition if any such loss is insured we may be required to pay significant amounts on any claim for recovery of such a loss prior to our insurer being obligated to reimburse us

operations   environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our properties may affect our results of operations   under various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestoscontaining materials into the air and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestoscontaining materials   certain environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated property even after they no longer own or operate the property moreover the past or present owner or operator from which a release emanates could be liable for any personal injuries or property damages that may result from such releases as well as any damages to natural resources that may arise from such releases   certain environmental laws impose compliance obligations on owners and operators of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctions   no assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our properties did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our properties there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liability   costs associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expenses   under the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our properties or restrict certain further renovations of the properties with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of  9      table of contents damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected   our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our results   our tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operations   we face competition for the acquisition of selfstorage properties and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitions   we compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of selfstorage properties and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of selfstorage properties these competitors may drive up the price we pay for selfstorage properties or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in single property acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for selfstorage properties or other assets our profitability will be reduced   we may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growth   our ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable properties or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock price   our ability to acquire properties on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks   competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment funds  competition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitability   10      table of contents   the inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditions   failure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at all  we may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired properties and  we may acquire properties subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the properties and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties    in addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securities   we may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired properties   we expect to make future acquisitions of selfstorage properties if we acquire any selfstorage properties we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired properties may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a whole   we do not always obtain independent appraisals of our properties and thus the consideration paid for these properties may exceed the value that may be indicated by thirdparty appraisals   we do not always obtain thirdparty appraisals in connection with our acquisition of properties and the consideration being paid by us in exchange for those properties may exceed the value determined by thirdparty appraisals in such cases the value of the properties was determined by our senior management team   our investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributions   to the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects   we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at all   we may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts   we may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations and  occupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped properties may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitable    in deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed property as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securities  11      table of contents  we may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop properties could be affected which would limit our growth   risks related to our organization and structure   our business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with us   our success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop properties in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospects   we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different risks   we may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuations   if other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitions   because we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of properties to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitions   tax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levels   we have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our business   our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority   as of december 31 2012 we held interests in 281 operating properties through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new selfstorage properties and acquiring existing properties in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the properties we currently hold  12      table of contents through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting properties owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial condition   conflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnership   conflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any action or engaging in any transaction as to which it has a conflict of interest   additionally the partnership agreement expressly limits our liability by providing that neither we our direct whollyowned massachusetts business trust subsidiary as the general partner of the operating partnership nor any of our or their trustees directors or officers will be liable or accountable in damages to our operating partnership the limited partners or assignees for errors in judgment mistakes of fact or law or for any act or omission if we or such trustee director or officer acted in good faith in addition our operating partnership is required to indemnify us our affiliates and each of our respective trustees officers directors employees and agents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law against any and all losses claims damages liabilities whether joint or several expenses including without limitation attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses judgments fines settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims demands actions suits or proceedings civil criminal administrative or investigative that relate to the operations of the operating partnership provided that our operating partnership will not indemnify for 1 willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law 2 any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement or 3 in the case of a criminal proceeding the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful   the provisions of delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that  13      table of contents purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreement   certain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transaction   our charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter   our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders   our charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholders   our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited   maryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officers   to the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stock   distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common  14      table of contents stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basis   risks related to the real estate industry   our primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage properties   our current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage properties consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results   illiquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our properties   because real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more properties in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any property for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a property   we may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a property can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a property we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that property for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that property these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a property even if we deem it necessary or appropriate   any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulations   we have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating results   any negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock price   to the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assets  15      table of contents  risks related to our debt financings   disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us   uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing   required payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our properties or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations   as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 16 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future properties additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributions   if we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following   our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments   we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reit  we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness  because a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense  we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties possibly on disadvantageous terms   after debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reduced   our debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt   we may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our properties that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leases  we may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees   16                     table of contents    we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations and  our default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other properties    we could become highly leveraged in the future because our organizational documents contain no limitation on the amount of debt we may incur   our organizational documents contain no limitations on the amount of indebtedness that we or our operating partnership may incur we could alter the balance between our total outstanding indebtedness and the value of our portfolio at any time if we become more highly leveraged the resulting increase in debt service could adversely affect our ability to make payments on our outstanding indebtedness and to pay our anticipated cash distributions andor to continue to make cash distributions to maintain our reit qualification and could harm our financial condition   increases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders   as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 16 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 2987 million or 190 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 23 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 26 million annually   failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations   in certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders   risks related to qualification and operation as a reit   to maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditions   to qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt  17      table of contents of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization payments   dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax rates   the maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 15 through 2012 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securities   in addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our properties   possible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholders   the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed   the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders   our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders   our failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stock   we believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because   we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates  we also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes and   unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualified    in addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate  18      table of contents stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securities   qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reit   we will pay some taxes   even though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages selfstorage properties for our joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we dont intend to sell properties as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholders  19      table of contents  complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities   to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profits       item 1b unresolved staff comments    none       item 2 properties    as of december 31 2012 we owned or had ownership interests in 729 operating selfstorage properties of these properties 448 are whollyowned and 281 are held in joint ventures in addition we managed an additional 181 properties for third parties bringing the total number of properties which we own andor manage to 910 these properties are located in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico we receive a management fee generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues to manage the joint venture and third party sites as of december 31 2012 we owned andor managed approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space configured in approximately 610000 separate storage units approximately 81 of our properties are clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these markets contain aboveaverage population and income demographics for new selfstorage properties the clustering of assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale our acquisitions have given us an increased scale in many core markets as well as a foothold in many markets where we had no previous presence   we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization we consider a property to be stabilized once it has achieved either an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years   as of december 31 2012 over 490000 tenants were leasing storage units at the 910 operating properties that we own andor manage primarily on a monthtomonth basis providing the flexibility to increase rental rates over time as market conditions permit although leases are shortterm in duration the typical tenant tends to remain at our properties for an extended period of time for properties that were stabilized as of december 31 2012 the average length of stay was approximately 13 months the average annual rent per square foot at these stabilized properties was approximately 1388 at december 31 2012 compared to 1350 at december 31 2011   our property portfolio is made up of different types of construction and building configurations depending on the site and the municipality where it is located most often sites are what we consider hybrid facilities a mix of both driveup buildings and multifloor buildings we have a number of multifloor buildings with elevator access only and a number of facilities featuring groundfloor access only  20                 table of contents   the following table presents additional

thousands except share and per share data  overview   we are a fully integrated selfadministered and selfmanaged real estate investment trust or reit formed to continue the business commenced in 1977 by our predecessor companies to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop professionally managed selfstorage properties   at december 31 2012 we owned had ownership interests in or managed 910 operating properties in 34 states washington dc and puerto rico of these 910 operating properties we owned 448 we held joint venture interests in 281 properties and our taxable reit subsidiary extra space management inc operated an additional 181 properties that are owned by third parties these operating properties contain approximately 670 million square feet of rentable space in approximately 610000 units and currently serve a customer base of over 490000 tenants   our properties are generally situated in convenient highly visible locations clustered around large population centers such as atlanta baltimorewashington dc boston chicago dallas houston las vegas los angeles miami new york city orlando philadelphia phoenix st petersburgtampa and san franciscooakland these areas all enjoy above average population growth and income levels the clustering of our assets around these population centers enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale we consider a property to be in the leaseup stage after it has been issued a certificate of occupancy but before it has achieved stabilization a property is considered to be stabilized once it has achieved an 80 occupancy rate for a full year measured as of january 1 or has been open for three years   to maximize the performance of our properties we employ stateoftheart webbased tracking and yield management technology and an industryleading revenue management system developed by our management team these systems enable us to analyze set and adjust rental rates in real time across our portfolio in order to respond to changing market conditions we believe our systems and processes allow us to more proactively manage revenues   we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases at each of our whollyowned selfstorage properties from management fees on the properties we manage for jointventure partners and unaffiliated third parties and from our tenant reinsurance program our management fee is generally equal to approximately 6 of cash collected from total revenues generated by the managed properties we also receive an asset management fee of 05 of the total asset value from one of our joint ventures   we operate in competitive markets often where consumers have multiple selfstorage properties from which to choose competition has impacted and will continue to impact our property results we experience seasonal fluctuations in occupancy levels with occupancy levels generally higher in the summer months due to increased moving activity our operating results depend materially on our ability to lease available selfstorage units to actively manage unit rental rates and on the ability of our tenants to make required rental payments we believe that we are able to respond quickly and effectively to changes in local regional and national economic conditions by adjusting rental rates through the use of our systems  28      table of contents  we continue to evaluate and implement a range of new initiatives and opportunities in order to enable us to maximize stockholder value our strategies to maximize stockholder value include the following   maximize the performance of properties through strategic efficient and proactive management we pursue revenuegenerating and expenseminimizing opportunities in our operations our revenue management team seeks to maximize revenue by responding to changing market conditions through our technology systems ability to provide realtime interactive rental rate and discount management our size allows us greater ability than the majority of our competitors to implement national regional and local marketing programs which we believe will attract more customers to our stores at a lower net cost   acquire selfstorage properties from strategic partners and third parties our acquisitions team continues to pursue the acquisition of single properties and multiproperty portfolios that we believe can provide stockholder value we have established a reputation as a reliable ethical buyer which we believe enhances our ability to negotiate and close acquisitions in addition we believe our status as an upreit enables flexibility when structuring deals we continue to see available acquisitions on which to bid and are seeing increasing prices however we remain a disciplined buyer and look for acquisitions that will strengthen our portfolio and increase stockholder value   expand our management business our management business enables us to generate increased revenues through management fees and expand our geographic footprint this expanded footprint enables us to reduce our operating costs through economies of scale in addition we see our management business as a future acquisition pipeline we pursue strategic relationships with owners whose properties would enhance our portfolio in the event an opportunity arises to acquire the properties    during 2012 we acquired 91 whollyowned properties and completed the development of one whollyowned property   critical accounting policies and estimates   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those that impact our most critical accounting policies we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following are our most critical accounting policies   consolidation arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as variable interest entities vies an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it is the primary beneficiary of the vie   a vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii the entitys equity holders as a group either a lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity if they occur or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur if an entity is deemed to be a vie the enterprise that is deemed to have a variable interest or combination of variable interests that provides the  29      table of contents enterprise with a controlling financial interest in the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie   we have concluded that under certain circumstances when we 1 enter into option agreements for the purchase of land or facilities from an entity and pay a nonrefundable deposit or 2 enter into arrangements for the formation of joint ventures a vie may be created under condition i ii b or c of the previous paragraph for each vie created we have performed a qualitative analysis including considering which party if any has the power to direct the activities most significant to the economic performance of each vie and whether that party has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could be significant to the vie if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the assets liabilities and operations of the vie are consolidated with our financial statements as of december 31 2012 the company had no consolidated vies additionally our operating partnership has notes payable to three trusts that are vies under condition iia above since the operating partnership is not the primary beneficiary of the trusts these vies are not consolidated   real estate assets real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation direct and allowable internal costs associated with the development construction renovation and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized interest property taxes and other costs associated with development incurred during the construction period are capitalized   expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred major replacements and betterments that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives depreciation is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the buildings and improvements which are generally between 5 and 39 years   in connection with our acquisition of properties the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their fair values which are estimated using significant unobservable inputs the value of the tangible assets consisting of land and buildings are determined as if vacant intangible assets which represent the value of existing tenant relationships are recorded at their fair values based on the avoided cost to replace the current leases we measure the value of tenant relationships based on the rent lost due to the amount of time required to replace existing customers which is based on our historical experience with turnover in our facilities debt assumed as part of an acquisition is recorded at fair value based on current interest rates compared to contractual rates acquisitionrelated transaction costs are expensed as incurred   intangible lease rights include 1 purchase price amounts allocated to leases on three properties that cannot be classified as ground or building leases these rights are amortized to expense over the term of the leases and 2 intangibles related to ground leases on five properties where the ground leases were assumed by the company at rates that were different than the current market rates for similar leases the value associated with these assumed leases were recorded as intangibles which will be amortized over the lease terms   evaluation of asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets held for use when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment we review each property at least annually to determine if any such events or circumstances have occurred or exist we focus on properties where occupancy andor rental income have decreased by a significant amount for these properties we determine whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the property will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition we carefully review properties in the leaseup stage and compare actual operating results to original projections   when we determine that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred we compare the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds  30      table of contents the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets   when real estate assets are identified as held for sale we discontinue depreciating the assets and estimate the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair values net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale are less than the net carrying value of the assets a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented   investments in real estate ventures our investments in real estate joint ventures where we have significant influence but not control and joint ventures which are vies in which we are not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements   under the equity method our investment in real estate ventures is stated at cost and adjusted for our share of net earnings or losses and reduced by distributions equity in earnings of real estate ventures is generally recognized based on our ownership interest in the earnings of each of the unconsolidated real estate ventures for the purposes of presentation in the statement of cash flows we follow the look through approach for classification of distributions from joint ventures under this approach distributions are reported under operating cash flow unless the facts and circumstances of a specific distribution clearly indicate that it is a return of capital eg a liquidating dividend or distribution of the proceeds from the joint ventures sale of assets in which case it is reported as an investing activity   our management assesses annually whether there are any indicators that the value of our investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment using significant unobservable inputs is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment   derivative instruments and hedging activities the accounting for

preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interests income allocated to the preferred operating partnership equals the fixed distribution paid to the preferred op unit holder plus approximately 10 and 11 of the remaining net income allocated after the adjustment for the fixed distribution paid for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the amount allocated to preferred operating partnership noncontrolling interest was higher in 2011 than in 2010 as our net income was higher in 2011 than it was in 2010   net income allocated to operating partnership and other noncontrolling interests income allocated to the operating partnership represents approximately 32 and 38 of net income after the allocation of the fixed distribution paid to the preferred op unit holder for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively losses allocated to other noncontrolling interests represents the losses allocated to partners in consolidated joint ventures   funds from operations   ffo provides relevant and meaningful information about our operating performance that is necessary along with net income and cash flows for an understanding of our operating results we believe ffo is a meaningful disclosure as a supplement to net earnings net earnings assume that the values of real estate assets diminish predictably over time as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses the values of real estate assets fluctuate due to market conditions and we believe ffo more accurately reflects the value of our real estate assets ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts inc nareit as net income computed in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses on sales of operating properties and impairment writedowns of depreciable real estate assets plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments to record unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures on the same basis we believe that to further understand our performance ffo should be considered along with the reported net income and cash flows in accordance with gaap as presented in the consolidated financial statements   the computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance as an alternative to net cash flow from  40      table of contents operating activities as a measure of our liquidity or as an indicator of our ability to make cash distributions the following table presents the calculation of ffo for the periods indicated                         for the year ended december 31          2012    2011

refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates our future income cash flows and fair values of financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates   interest rate risk   interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary and tax policies domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control   as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 1574280 in total debt of which approximately 298675 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps if libor were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt excluding variable rate debt with interest rate floors would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 2600 annually   interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur further in the event of a change of that magnitude we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change however due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects these analyses assume no changes in our financial

control and joint ventures which are vies in which the company is not the primary beneficiary are recorded under the equity method of accounting on the accompanying consolidated financial statements   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   reclassifications   certain amounts in the 2011 and 2010 financial statements and supporting note disclosures have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation such reclassifications did not impact previously reported net income or accumulated deficit   fair value disclosures   derivative financial instruments   currently the company uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate risk the valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives including the period to maturity and uses observable marketbased inputs including  57      table of contents  extra space storage inc   notes to consolidated financial statements continued   december 31 2012   amounts in thousands except property and share data   2 summary of significant accounting policies continued  interest rate curves the fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts the variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates forward curves derived from observable market interest rate forward curves   the company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterpartys nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk the company has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings thresholds mutual puts and guarantees in conjunction with the financial accounting standard boards fair value measurement guidance the company made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio   although the company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties however as of december 31 2012 the company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives as a result the company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy   the table below

facilities the company determines whether the decrease is temporary or permanent and whether the facility will likely recover the lost occupancy andor revenue in the short term in addition the company carefully reviews facilities in the leaseup stage and compares actual operating results to original projections   when the company determines that an event that may indicate impairment has occurred the company compares the carrying value of the related longlived assets to the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets an impairment loss is recorded if the net carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future net operating cash flows attributable to the assets the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net carrying value over the related fair value of the assets   when real estate assets are identified by management as held for sale the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the fair value of the assets net of selling costs if the estimated fair value net of selling costs of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net carrying value of the assets then a valuation allowance is established the operations of assets held for sale or sold during the period are generally presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented   the company assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the companys investments in unconsolidated real estate ventures may be impaired annually and when events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment an investment is impaired if managements estimate of the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value to the extent impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the fair value of the investment   as of december 31 2012 and 2011 the company did not have any assets or liabilities

from both its business operations and economic conditions the company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities the company manages economic risks including interest rate liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments specifically the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future
