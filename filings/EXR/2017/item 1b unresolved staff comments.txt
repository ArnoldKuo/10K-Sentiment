executive officers and directors owning approximately 4665566 shares or 37 of our outstanding common stock as of february 21 20174industry amp competitionstores offer monthtomonth storage space rental for personal or business use and are a costeffective and flexible storage alternative tenants rent fully enclosed spaces that can vary in size according to their specific needs and to which they have unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as neededselfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a stores local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goodsour research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a stores perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of timethe selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early marchsince inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2008 the national average physical occupancy rate was 803 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 912 in 2016recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continuethe industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten selfstorage companies in the united states operated approximately 194 of the total us stores and the top 50 selfstorage companies operated approximately 286 of the total us stores as of december 31 2016 we believe this fragmentation will contribute to continued consolidation at some level in the future we also believe that we are well positioned to compete for acquisitionswe are the second

satisfaction at each of our stores and any difficulties we encounter in hiring training and maintaining skilled field personnel may harm our operating performancewe had 2723 field personnel as of february 21 2017 in the management and operation of our stores the general professionalism of our store managers and staff are contributing factors to a stores ability to successfully secure rentals and retain tenants we also rely upon our field personnel to maintain clean and secure stores if we are unable to successfully recruit train and retain qualified field personnel the quality of service

in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on stores or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures which could similarly adversely affect our business and results of operationsenvironmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with operating our stores may affect our results of operationsunder various us federal state and local laws ordinances and regulations owners and operators of real estate may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating certain hazardous substances or other regulated materials on or in such property such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of such substances or materials the presence of such substances or materials or the failure to properly remediate such substances may adversely affect the owners or operators ability to lease sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances or other regulated materials may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person certain environmental laws impose liability for release

environmental laws also impose liability without regard to knowledge or fault for removal or remediation of hazardous substances or other regulated materials upon owners and operators of contaminated

of real property with respect to the management of hazardous materials and other regulated substances for example environmental laws govern the management of asbestoscontaining materials and leadbased paint failure to comply with these laws can result in penalties or other sanctionsno assurances can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of our stores reveal all environmental liabilities that any prior owner or operator of our stores did not create any material environmental condition not known to us or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our stores there also exists the risk that material environmental conditions liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the review was completed or may arise in the future finally future laws ordinances or regulations and future interpretations of existing laws ordinances or regulations may impose additional material environmental liabilitycosts associated with complying with the americans with disabilities act of 1990 may result in unanticipated expensesunder the ada places of public accommodation are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons these requirements became effective in 1992 a number of additional us federal state and local laws may also require modifications to our stores or restrict certain further renovations of the stores with respect to access thereto by disabled persons noncompliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants and also could result in an order to correct any noncomplying feature which could result in substantial capital expenditures we have not conducted an audit or investigation of all of our stores to determine our compliance and we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada or other legislation if one or more of our stores is not in compliance with the ada or other legislation then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the facility into compliance if we incur substantial costs to comply with the ada or other legislation our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to make cash distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affectedour tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation which may adversely affect our resultsour tenant reinsurance business is subject to significant governmental regulation the regulatory authorities generally have broad discretion to grant renew and revoke licenses and approvals to promulgate interpret and implement regulations and to evaluate compliance with regulations through periodic examinations audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance providers as a result of regulatory or private action in any jurisdiction we may be temporarily or permanently suspended from continuing some or all of our reinsurance activities or otherwise fined or penalized or suffer an adverse judgment which could adversely affect our business and results of operationswe face competition for the acquisition of stores and other assets which may impede our ability to make future acquisitions or may increase the cost of these acquisitionswe compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of stores and other assets including national regional and local operators and developers of stores these competitors may drive up the price we pay for stores or other assets we seek to acquire or may succeed in acquiring those stores or assets themselves in addition our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater resources may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy in addition the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment in stores may increase this competition would result in increased demand for these assets and therefore increased prices paid for them because of an increased interest in singlestore acquisitions among taxmotivated individual purchasers we may pay higher prices if we purchase single stores in comparison with portfolio acquisitions if we pay higher prices for stores or other assets our profitability will be reducedwe may not be successful in identifying and consummating suitable acquisitions that meet our criteria which may impede our growthour ability to expand through acquisitions is integral to our business strategy and requires us to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities that meet our criteria and are compatible with our growth strategy we may not be successful in identifying suitable stores or other assets that meet our acquisition criteria or in consummating acquisitions 9or investments on satisfactory terms or at all failure to identify or consummate acquisitions will slow our growth which could in turn adversely affect our stock priceour ability to acquire stores on favorable terms and successfully integrate and operate them may be constrained by the following significant risks competition from local investors and other real estate investors with significant capital including other publiclytraded reits and institutional investment fundscompetition from other potential acquirers may significantly increase the purchase price which could reduce our profitabilitythe inability to achieve satisfactory completion of due diligence investigations and other customary closing conditionsfailure to finance an acquisition on favorable terms or at allwe may spend more than the time and amounts budgeted to make necessary improvements or renovations to acquired stores andwe may acquire stores subject to liabilities without any recourse or with only limited recourse with respect to unknown liabilities such as liabilities for cleanup of undisclosed environmental contamination claims by persons dealing with the former owners of the stores and claims for indemnification by general partners directors officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the storesin addition strategic decisions by us such as acquisitions may adversely affect the price of our securitieswe may not be successful in integrating and operating acquired storeswe have acquired many stores in the past and we expect to continue acquiring stores in the future if we acquire any stores we will be required to integrate them into our existing portfolio the acquired stores may turn out to be less compatible with our growth strategy than originally anticipated may cause disruptions in our operations or may divert managements attention away from daytoday operations which could impair our operating results as a wholeour investments in development and redevelopment projects may not yield anticipated returns which would harm our operating results and reduce the amount of funds available for distributionsto the extent that we engage in development and redevelopment activities we will be subject to the following risks normally associated with these projects we may be unable to obtain financing for these projects on favorable terms or at allwe may not complete development or redevelopment projects on schedule or within budgeted amountswe may encounter delays or refusals in obtaining all necessary zoning land use building occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations andoccupancy rates and rents at newly developed or redeveloped stores may fluctuate depending on a number of factors including market and economic conditions and may result in our investment not being profitablein deciding whether to develop or redevelop a particular property we make certain assumptions regarding the expected future performance of the store we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring the property up to the standards established for its intended market position or may be unable to increase occupancy at a newly developed store as quickly as expected or at all any substantial unanticipated delays or expenses could adversely affect the investment returns from these development or redevelopment projects and harm our operating results liquidity and financial condition which could result in a decline in the value of our securitieswe may rely on the investments of our joint venture partners for funding certain of our development and redevelopment projects if our reputation in the selfstorage industry changes or the number of investors considering us an attractive strategic partner is otherwise reduced our ability to develop or redevelop stores could be affected which would limit our growthwe rely on information technology in our operations and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our businesswe rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes including financial transactions and records personally 10identifiable information and tenant and lease data we purchase some of our information technology from vendors on whom our systems depend we rely on commercially available systems software tools and monitoring to provide security for processing transmission and storage of confidential tenant and other sensitive information although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems it is possible that our safety and security measures will not be able to prevent the systems improper functioning or damage or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyberattacks security breaches including physical or electronic breakins computer viruses attacks by hackers and similar breaches can create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information while to date we have not experienced a security breach this risk has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of such breaches and attempted breaches from around the world have increased any failure to maintain proper function security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations damage our reputation divert significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operationsrisks related to our organization and structureour business could be harmed if key personnel with longstanding business relationships in the selfstorage industry terminate their employment with usour success depends on the continued services of members of our executive management team who have substantial experience in the selfstorage industry in addition our ability to acquire or develop stores in the future depends on the significant relationships our executive management team has developed with our institutional joint venture partners such as affiliates of prudential financial inc there is no guarantee that any of them will remain employed by us we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers the loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could harm our business and our prospectswe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business without stockholder consent which may subject us to different riskswe may change our investment and financing strategies and enter into new lines of business at any time without the consent of our stockholders which could result in our making investments and engaging in business activities that are different from and possibly riskier than the investments and businesses described in this document a change in our investment strategy or our entry into new lines of business may increase our exposure to other risks or real estate market fluctuationsif other selfstorage companies convert to an upreit structure or if tax laws change we may no longer have an advantage in competing for potential acquisitionsbecause we are structured as an upreit we are a more attractive acquirer of stores to taxmotivated sellers than our competitors that are not structured as upreits however if other selfstorage companies restructure their holdings to become upreits this competitive advantage will disappear in addition new legislation may be enacted or new interpretations of existing legislation may be issued by the internal revenue service irs or the us treasury department that could affect the attractiveness of our upreit structure so that it may no longer assist us in competing for acquisitionstax indemnification obligations may require the operating partnership to maintain certain debt levelswe have provided certain tax protections to various third parties in connection with their property contributions to the operating partnership upon acquisition by the company including making available the opportunity to 1 guarantee debt or 2 enter into a special loss allocation and deficit restoration obligation we have agreed to these provisions in order to assist these contributors in preserving their tax position after their contributions these obligations may require us to maintain certain indebtedness levels that we would not otherwise require for our businessour joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authorityas of december 31 2016 we held interests in 180 operating stores through joint ventures some of these arrangements could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decisionmaking authority our reliance on coventurers financial conditions and disputes between us and our coventurers we expect to continue our joint venture strategy by entering into more joint ventures for the purpose of developing new stores and acquiring existing stores in such event we would not be in a position to exercise sole decisionmaking authority regarding the property partnership joint venture or other entity the decisionmaking authority regarding the stores we currently hold through joint ventures is either vested exclusively with our joint venture partners is subject to a majority vote of the joint venture partners or equally shared by us and the joint venture partners in addition 11investments in partnerships joint ventures or other entities may under certain circumstances involve risks not present were a third party not involved including the possibility that partners or coventurers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions partners or coventurers may have economic or other business interests or goals which are inconsistent with our business interests or goals and may be in a position to take actions contrary to our policies or objectives such investments may also have the potential risk of impasses on decisions such as a sale because neither we nor the partner or coventurer would have full control over the partnership or joint venture disputes between us and partners or coventurers may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers andor directors from focusing their time and efforts on our business consequently actions by or disputes with partners or coventurers might result in subjecting stores owned by the partnership or joint venture to additional risk in addition we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our thirdparty partners or coventurers which could harm our financial conditionconflicts of interest could arise as a result of our relationship with our operating partnershipconflicts of interest could arise in the future as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates and our operating partnership or any partner thereof our directors and officers have duties to our company under applicable maryland law in connection with their management of our company at the same time we through our whollyowned subsidiary have fiduciary duties as a general partner to our operating partnership and to the limited partners under delaware law in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties through our whollyowned subsidiary as a general partner to our operating partnership and its partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our company the partnership agreement of our operating partnership does not require us to resolve such conflicts in favor of either our company or the limited partners in our operating partnership unless otherwise provided for in the relevant partnership agreement delaware law generally requires a general partner of a delaware limited partnership to adhere to fiduciary duty standards under which it owes its limited partners the highest duties of good faith fairness and loyalty and which generally prohibit such general partner from taking any

delaware law that allow the common law fiduciary duties of a general partner to be modified by a partnership agreement have not been resolved in a court of law and we have not obtained an opinion of counsel covering the provisions set forth in the partnership agreement that purport to waive or restrict our fiduciary duties that would be in effect under common law were it not for the partnership agreementcertain provisions of maryland law and our organizational documents including the stock ownership limit imposed by our charter may inhibit market activity in our stock and could prevent or delay a change in control transactionour charter subject to certain exceptions authorizes our directors to take such actions as are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a reit and to limit any person to actual or constructive ownership of no more than 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding common stock or 70 by value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding capital stock our board of directors in its sole discretion may exempt a proposed transferee from the ownership limit however our board of directors may not grant an exemption from the ownership limit to any proposed transferee whose ownership could jeopardize our qualification as a reit these restrictions on ownership will not apply if our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interests to attempt to qualify or to continue to qualify as a reit the ownership limit may delay or impede a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders different ownership limits apply to the family of kenneth m woolley certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing to spencer f kirk certain of his affiliates family members and estates and trusts formed for the benefit of the foregoing and to certain designated investment entities as defined in our charter12our board of directors has the power to issue additional shares of our stock in a manner that may not be in the best interest of our stockholdersour charter authorizes our board of directors to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to increase the aggregate number of authorized shares or the number of shares of any class or series without stockholder approval in addition our board of directors may classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares our board of directors could issue additional shares of our common stock or establish a series of preferred stock that could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our securities or otherwise not be in the best interests of our stockholdersour rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limitedmaryland law provides that a director or officer has no liability in that capacity if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in our best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances in addition our charter eliminates our directors and officers liability to us and our stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit in money property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty established by a final judgment and which is material to the cause of action our bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers for liability resulting from actions taken by them in those capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law in addition we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our directors and officersto the extent our distributions represent a return of capital for us federal income tax purposes our stockholders could recognize an increased capital gain upon a subsequent sale of common stockdistributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and not treated by us as a dividend will not be taxable to a us stockholder under current us federal income tax law to the extent those distributions do not exceed the stockholders adjusted tax basis in his her or its common stock but instead will constitute a return of capital and will reduce such adjusted basis if distributions result in a reduction of a stockholders adjusted basis in such holders common stock subsequent sales of such holders common stock will result in recognition of an increased capital gain or decreased capital loss due to the reduction in such adjusted basisrisks related to the real estate industryour primary business involves the ownership and operation of selfstorage storesour current strategy is to own operate manage acquire develop and redevelop only selfstorage stores consequently we are subject to risks inherent in investments in a single industry because investments in real estate are inherently illiquid this strategy makes it difficult for us to diversify our investment portfolio and to limit our risk when economic conditions change decreases in market rents negative tax real estate and zoning law changes and changes in environmental protection laws may also increase our costs lower the value of our investments and decrease our income which would adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultsilliquidity of real estate investments could significantly impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our storesbecause real estate investments are relatively illiquid our ability to promptly sell one or more stores in our portfolio in response to changing economic financial and investment conditions is limited the real estate market is affected by many factors such as general economic conditions availability of financing interest rates and other factors including supply and demand that are beyond our control we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any store for the price or on the terms set by us or whether any price or other terms offered by a prospective purchaser would be acceptable to us we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a storewe may be required to expend funds to correct defects or to make improvements before a store can be sold we cannot assure you that we will have funds available to correct those defects or to make those improvements in acquiring a store we may agree to transfer restrictions that materially restrict us from selling that store for a period of time or impose other restrictions such as a limitation on the amount of debt that can be placed or repaid on that store these transfer restrictions would impede our ability to sell a store even if we deem it necessary or appropriate13any investments in unimproved real property may take significantly longer to yield incomeproducing returns if at all and may result in additional costs to us to comply with rezoning restrictions or environmental regulationswe have invested in the past and may invest in the future in unimproved real property unimproved properties generally take longer to yield incomeproducing returns based on the typical time required for development any development of unimproved property may also expose us to the risks and uncertainties associated with rezoning the land for a higher use or development and environmental concerns of governmental entities andor community groups any unsuccessful investments or delays in realizing an incomeproducing return or increased costs to develop unimproved real estate could restrict our ability to earn our targeted rate of return on an investment or adversely affect our ability to pay operating expenses which would harm our financial condition and operating resultsany negative perceptions of the selfstorage industry generally may result in a decline in our stock priceto the extent that the investing public has a negative perception of the selfstorage industry the value of our securities may be negatively impacted which could result in our securities trading below the inherent value of our assetsrisks related to our debt financingsdisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain debt financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on usuncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional debt financing or to refinance existing debt maturities on favorable terms or at all which may negatively affect our ability to make acquisitions and fund development projects a downturn in the credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly in addition these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell stores or may adversely affect the price we receive for stores that we do sell as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financingrequired payments of principal and interest on borrowings may leave us with insufficient cash to operate our stores or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligationsas of december 31 2016 we had approximately 44 billion of outstanding indebtedness we may incur additional debt in connection with future acquisitions and development we may borrow under our credit lines or borrow new funds to finance these future stores additionally we do not anticipate that our internally generated cash flow will be adequate to repay our existing indebtedness upon maturity and therefore we expect to repay our indebtedness through refinancings and equity andor debt offerings further we may need to borrow funds in order to make cash distributions to maintain our qualification as a reit or to make our expected distributionsif we are required to utilize our credit lines for purposes other than acquisition activity this will reduce the amount available for acquisitions and could slow our growth therefore our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have significant adverse consequences including the following our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest paymentswe may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms including to make acquisitions or to continue to make distributions required to maintain our qualification as a reitwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtednessbecause a portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates an increase in interest rates could materially increase our interest expensewe may be forced to dispose of one or more of our stores possibly on disadvantageous termsafter debt service the amount available for cash distributions to our stockholders is reducedour debt level could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debtwe may experience increased vulnerability to economic and industry downturns reducing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditionswe may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgagees may foreclose on our stores that secure their loans and receive an assignment of rents and leaseswe may default on our obligations and the lenders or mortgages may enforce our guarantees14we may violate restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate our debt obligations andour default under any one of our mortgage loans with crossdefault or crosscollateralization provisions could result in a default on other indebtedness or result in the foreclosures of other storesincreases in interest rates may increase our interest expense and adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholdersas of december 31 2016 we had approximately 44 billion of debt outstanding of which approximately 13 billion or 300 was subject to variable interest rates excluding debt with interest rate swaps this variable rate debt had a weighted average interest rate of approximately 23 per annum increases in interest rates on this variable rate debt would increase our interest expense which could harm our cash flow and our ability to pay cash distributions for example if market rates of interest on this variable rate debt increased by 100 basis points the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 131 million annuallyfailure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operationsin certain cases we may seek to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility by using interest rate hedging arrangements hedging involves risks such as the risk that the counterparty may fail to honor its obligations under an arrangement failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholdersrisks related to qualification and operation as a reitto maintain our qualification as a reit we may be forced to borrow funds on a shortterm basis during unfavorable market conditionsto qualify as a reit we generally must distribute to our stockholders at least 90 of our net taxable income each year excluding net capital gains and we are subject to regular corporate income taxes to the extent that we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income each year in addition we are subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which distributions made by us in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of our ordinary income 95 of our capital gain net income and 100 of our undistributed income from prior years while historically we have satisfied these distribution requirements by making cash distributions to our stockholders a reit is permitted to satisfy these requirements by making distributions of cash or other property including in limited circumstances its own stock assuming we continue to satisfy these distributions requirements with cash we may need to borrow funds on a shortterm basis or possibly longterm to meet the reit distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings these borrowing needs could result from a difference in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for us federal income tax purposes or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt amortization paymentsdividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for reduced tax ratesthe maximum us federal income tax rate for dividends paid by domestic corporations to individual us stockholders is 20 dividends paid by reits however are generally not eligible for the reduced rates the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause stockholders who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our securitiesin addition the relative attractiveness of real estate in general may be adversely affected by the favorable tax treatment given to corporate dividends which could negatively affect the value of our storespossible legislative or other actions affecting reits could adversely affect our stockholdersthe rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect our stockholders it cannot be predicted whether when in what forms or with what effective dates the tax laws applicable to us or our stockholders will be changed15the power of our board of directors to revoke our reit election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholdersour charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our stockholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to qualify as a reit we would become subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our net taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholdersour failure to qualify as a reit would have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our stockwe believe we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit or lose our qualification as a reit at any time we will face serious tax consequences that would substantially reduce the funds available for distribution for each of the years involved because we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rateswe also could be subject to the us federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes andunless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions we could not elect to be taxed as a reit for four taxable years following a year during which we were disqualifiedin addition if we fail to qualify as a reit we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders and all distributions to stockholders will be subject to tax as regular corporate dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits this means that our us individual stockholders would be taxed on our dividends at capital gains rates and our us corporate stockholders would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends subject in each case to applicable limitations under the internal revenue code if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the relief provisions under the internal revenue code in order to maintain our reit status we may nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of 50000 or more for each such failure as a result of all these factors our failure to qualify as a reit also could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and could adversely affect the value of our securitiesqualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the internal revenue code is greater in the case of a reit that like us holds its assets through a partnership the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit we must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the composition of our assets the sources of our gross income and the owners of our stock our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the fair market value of our assets some of which are not susceptible to precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals also we must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of our net taxable income excluding capital gains and we will be subject to income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100 of our net taxable income including capital gains in addition legislation new regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions may adversely affect our investors our ability to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a reit relative to other investments although we believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that is intended to allow us to qualify for taxation as a reit we can give no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a reit for tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the internal revenue service regarding our qualification as a reitwe will pay some taxeseven though we qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we will be required to pay some us federal state and local taxes on our income and property extra space management inc manages stores for our joint ventures and stores owned by third parties we jointly with extra space management inc elected to treat extra space management inc as a taxable reit subsidiary trs of our company for us federal income tax purposes a taxable reit subsidiary is a fully taxable corporation and may be limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to us esm reinsurance limited a whollyowned subsidiary of extra space management inc generates income from insurance premiums that are subject to federal income tax and state insurance premiums tax in addition we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on certain amounts if the economic arrangements among our tenants our taxable reit subsidiary and us are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties or if we receive payments for inventory or property held for sale to customers in the 16ordinary course of business also if we sell property as a dealer ie to customers in the ordinary course of our trade or business we will be subject to a 100 penalty tax on any gain arising from such sales while we do not intend to sell stores as a dealer the irs could take a contrary position to the extent that we are or our taxable reit subsidiary is required to pay us federal state or local taxes we will have less cash available for distribution to stockholderscomplying with reit requirements may cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunitiesto qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock in order to meet these tests we may be required to forgo attractive business or investment opportunities thus compliance with the reit requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize profitsitem 1b unresolved staff commentsnone
