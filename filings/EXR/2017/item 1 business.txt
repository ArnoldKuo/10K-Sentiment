unlimited exclusive access tenants have responsibility for moving their items into and out of their units selfstorage unit sizes typically range from 5 feet by 5 feet to 20 feet by 20 feet with an interior height of 8 feet to 12 feet stores generally have onsite managers who supervise and run the daytoday operations providing tenants with assistance as neededselfstorage provides a convenient way for individuals and businesses to store their possessions due to life changes or simply because of a need for storage space the mix of residential tenants using a store is determined by a stores local demographics and often includes people who are looking to downsize their living space or others who are not yet settled into a permanent residence items that residential tenants place in selfstorage range from cars boats and recreational vehicles to furniture household items and appliances commercial tenants tend to include small business owners who require easy and frequent access to their goods records inventory or storage for seasonal goodsour research has shown that tenants choose a store based primarily on the convenience of the site to their home or business making highdensity hightraffic population centers ideal locations for stores a stores perceived security and the general professionalism of the site managers and staff are also contributing factors to a sites ability to successfully secure rentals although most stores are leased to tenants on a monthtomonth basis tenants tend to continue their leases for extended periods of timethe selfstorage business is subject to seasonal fluctuations a greater portion of revenues and profits are realized from may through september historically our highest level of occupancy has been at the end of july while our lowest level of occupancy has been in late february and early marchsince inception in the early 1970s the selfstorage industry has experienced significant growth the selfstorage industry has also seen increases in occupancy over the past several years according to the selfstorage almanac the almanac in 2008 the national average physical occupancy rate was 803 of net rentable square feet compared to an average physical occupancy rate of 912 in 2016recently we have encountered competition when we have sought to acquire stores especially for brokered portfolios competitive bidding practices have been commonplace between both public and private entities and this will likely continuethe industry is also characterized by fragmented ownership according to the almanac the top ten
