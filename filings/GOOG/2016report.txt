google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one as part of that they also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we haveto help accelerate this we announced plans in august 2015 to create a new public holding company called alphabet alphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that we combine as other bets and generally are pretty far afield of our main internet products such as verily calico x nest gv google capital and accessgoogle fiber our alphabet structure is about helping businesses within alphabet prosper through strong leaders and independence at google our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world we generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find costeffective googles core products such as search android maps chrome youtube google play and gmail each have over one billion monthly active users and we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface googles vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems our other bets are also making important strides in their industries and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the long termserving our users in many ways google search  and the clean white page with the blinking cursor  is a metaphor for how we think about innovation imagining the ways things could be  without constraint  is the process we use to look for better answers to some of lifes everyday problems its about starting with the what if and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answerits been that way from the beginning providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to google and our products have come a long way in the last decade we used to show just ten blue links in our results you had to click through to different websites to get your answers which took time now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers  even if youre speaking your question using voice search  which makes it quicker easier and more natural to find what youre looking forover time we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily what if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage thats gmail what if we could make a simpler speedier safer browser thats chrome what if we could provide easy access to movies books music and apps no matter which device youre on thats google play what if developers could use googles infrastructure to easily build and scale applications and what if people could collaborate and get work done from anywhere on any device thats cloud and appsas devices proliferate its more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them  that the technology gets out of the way so you can move through this multiscreen world as easily as possible its why were investing so much in platforms like our chrome browser chrome os and our android mobile operating system ultimately we want you to have speedy secure access to whatever you need wherever you happen to be and on whatever device you may be using at the timeads as answerswe asked what if ads werent intrusive and annoying what if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information what if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right peopleour advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices we generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertisingperformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results2table of contentsalphabet inc and google incfor performance advertisers adwords our primary auctionbased advertising program helps create simple textbased ads that appear on google websites and the websites of google network members who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content in addition our partners that comprise the google network use our adsense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience these programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home to that end we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades including estimated total conversions which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multiscreen worldbrand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns and in turn generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the trueview ads displayed on our youtube videoswe have built a worldclass ad technology platform for brand advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses we aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies we also seek to improve the measurability of the effectiveness of brand advertisingfurthermore we have invested significantly in programmatic advertising to help advertisers reach users when and where it matters giving them access to toptier inventory across screens and formats as well as the realtime insights that advertisers need to make their buys countwe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways ranging from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad contentbringing the next 5 billion onlinefast search and highquality ads matter only if you have access to the internet right now only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online that leaves out billions of people with so much useful and lifechanging information available today it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the worlds population lacks even the most basic internet connectionthose people will be able to learn and start businesses to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an internet connection creating platforms for other peoples success is a huge part of who we are we want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there connection is powerful and we are working hard to make it a reality for everyone the opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endlessand there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes into their schools and into their pockets  showing them just how powerful the simple idea of getting online can beat google we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets primarily through android and chrome were also making sure our core google apps are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed size and connectivity are central concernsother alphabet companies are pursuing initiatives with similar goals too thats why were investing in new projects like project loon we asked what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas loon has helped students in brazil and farmers in new zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time and as the program expands we hope to bring this to more and more people  creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people all around the worldmoonshotsthe idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new ambitious projects both within google and other bets everything might not fit into a neat little box we believe that is exactly how to stay relevant many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser respectively we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the longterm3table of contentsalphabet inc and google incwe wont become complacent relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on as we said in the 2004 founders ipo letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our longterm success we wont stop asking what if and then working hard to find the answeras explained in the letter from our ceo in august 2015 our alphabet reorganization was implemented to better allow us to structure teams in ways that we believe will produce the fastest most focused innovation possible for moonshot projectsresearchwe continue to invest in our existing products and services including search and advertising as well as developing new products and services through research and product development we often release earlystage products we then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those productsour research and development expenses which includes the vast majority of engineering and technical headcount responsible for research and development as well as their associated costs were 71 billion 98 billion and 123 billion in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which included stockbased compensation expense of 16 billion 22 billion and 27 billion respectively we expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and building systems to develop new products and services and improve existing onescompetitionour business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising we face competition fromgeneral purpose search engines and information services such as yahoo microsofts bing yandex baidu naver webcrawler and mywebsearchvertical search engines and ecommerce websites such as kayak travel queries linkedin job queries webmd health queries and amazon and ebay ecommerce some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through googlesocial networks such as facebook and twitter some users are increasingly relying on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search enginesother forms of advertising such as television radio newspapers magazines billboards and yellow pages our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media both online and offlineother online advertising platforms and networks including criteo appnexus and facebook that compete for advertisers with adwords our primary auctionbased advertising programother operating systems and mobile device companiesproviders of online products and services that provide answers information and services a number of our online products and services including gmail youtube and google docs compete directly with new and established companies which offer communication information storage and entertainment services either on a standalone basis or integrated into other offeringscompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retainusers for whom other products and services are literally one click away

results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common and capital stockrisks related to our businesses and industrieswe face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected our businesses are rapidly evolving intensely competitive and subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and for google provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core businesswe have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce websites social networks providers of online products and services other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks other operating systems and wireless mobile device companies our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before usour competitors are constantly developing innovations in search online advertising wireless mobile devices operating systems and many other webbased products and services the research and development of new technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment as well as the accurate anticipation of technology market trends and consumer needs as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use if we are unable to provide quality products and services then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline in addition these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely affectedour ongoing investment in new businesses and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing businesseswe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments distraction of management from current operations and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results6table of contentsalphabet inc and google incmore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet and accessing new devices to make search queries if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely affected the number of people who access the internet through devices other than desktop computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets video game consoles and television settop devices is increasing dramatically the functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult or just different and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms which could affect our search and advertising business over time as new devices and platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers distributors developers and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic multiscreen environmentwe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could seriously harm our businesswe generated 90 of total google segment revenues from advertising in 2015 many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives if we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on advertising revenues which could adversely affect our revenues and businessin addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and businessour revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the futureour revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors includingincreasing competitionchanges in property mix platform mix and geographical mixthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levelsthe evolution of the online advertising market including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising and the other markets in which we participate andthe rate of user adoption of our products services and technologieswe believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business for instance the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on google websites consequently our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on google websites additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network membersadditionally our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content and apps advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites or traditional formats further our margins could be impacted 7table of contentsalphabet inc and google incadversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our rampd efforts across the company such as our other bets businesses than we have historicallywe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business the growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown for instance several regulatory agencies have sought to review our search and other businesses on potential competition concerns we continue to cooperate with the european commission ec and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices these changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material wayswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property privacy consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters the sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects as well as health and safety hazardous materials usage and other environmental concerns in addition our businesses face intellectual property litigation as further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell products and servicessuch claims suits and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered

financial condition and results of operations we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks includediversion of management time and

result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or results also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materializeour business depends on a strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers google network members and other partners our strong google brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brands of both google and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical performance failures further if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the google brand our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in peoples everyday livesa variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business for example current and new patent laws such as us patent laws and european patent laws may affect the ability of companies including us to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the futureclaims have been or may be threatened and filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement product liability or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users furthermore many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses products services and technologies in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroadin addition other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include among othersthe digital millennium copyright act which has provisions that limit in the us but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for caching or hosting or for listing or linking to thirdparty websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact uscourt decisions such as the right to be forgotten ruling issued by the european court which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our usersvarious us and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect

risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penaltieswe are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future internet technology media and other companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologieswe have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our businessfurthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities in addition many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered productsregardless of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectivealthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceablewe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secretswe also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand10table of contentsalphabet inc and google incany significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating resultswe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content we host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the us and internationally claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright or trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort including personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties including our users in addition we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or thirdparty content that we have made available within our services violates us and nonus lawwe also arrange for the distribution of thirdparty advertisements to thirdparty publishers and advertising networks and we offer thirdparty products services or content we may be subject to claims concerning these products services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing branding broadcasting or providing access to them even if we do not ourselves host operate provide or provide access to these products services or content defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse mannerprivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services from time to time concerns have been expressed about whether our products services or processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating resultsin addition as nearly all of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business we expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countriesregulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection including measures to ensure that our encryption of users data does not hinder law enforcement agencies access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessrecent legal developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us a preliminary agreement has been reached between the us and european governments to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data however given the preliminary nature of the agreement some uncertainty remains and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessif our security measures are breached or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or

loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customerswe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results and prospects we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management for instance the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impactedwe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and we have thirdparty arrangements for the design of some components and parts our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with themwe have in the past and may experience in the future supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers workaround plans to address shortages could entail increased freight costs for expedited shipments we may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruptionadditionally because many of our supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supplywe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to thirdparty intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third partiesthe doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures pertaining to a manufacturers efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc conflict free components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our productsweb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality which could damage our reputation and deter our current and

described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the followingchanges in local political economic regulatory tax social and labor conditions which may adversely harm our businessrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the

that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures particularly in light of our holding company reorganization and new operating structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future successour business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisersour products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet and

marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures including legal actions that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings in addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers thereby harming our revenues and growthnew technologies could block online ads which would harm our google business technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products most of our google revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages

recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our

operating performancewe cannot guarantee that our recently announced stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our stock repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves in october 2015 our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to 509901951359 of our class c capital stock and in january 2016 our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares the repurchase program does not have an expiration date although our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the stock repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which

affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition because our class c capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c capital stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to

with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k trends in our businessthe following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future resultsusers behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolvesthe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception resulting in increasing revenues and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our businessas online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetizationas interactions between users and advertisers change we continue to expand our product offerings to serve their changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search desktop ads additionally advertisers are beginning to shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user in the right moment in the right context this may also have different monetization profiles to our existing advertising business these trends will continue to affect our monetization in the futureusers are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formatsour users are accessing the internet via multiple devices mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our businessin this multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets our traffic acquisition cost tac may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may differ from our traditional desktop and tablet formats we expect both of these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multiscreen environmentas users in developing economies increasingly come online we generate increasing revenues from international markets and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues22table of contentsalphabet inc and google incthe shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us especially in emerging markets and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more availableour international revenues represent a significant proportion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earningsthe portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasingnonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products like google play cloud and apps and hardware products across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of digital content products hardware sales service and licensing fees the margins on these nonadvertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues themselves could be volatileas we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in rampd and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuatewe continue to make significant research and development rampd investments in areas of strategic focus for google such as search and advertising as well as in new products and services across both google and other bets the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems data centers real estate and facilities and information technology infrastructurein addition acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments

impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons our international revenues are favorably impacted as the us dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies and unfavorably impacted as the us dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating resultsconstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period we define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a yearonyear basis constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current periodconstant currency revenue growth expressed as a percentage is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periodsthese results should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for results reported in accordance with gaap results on a constant currency basis as we

google network members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on google network members websites are shared with our google network members for the past five years growth in advertising revenues from google websites has generally exceeded that from our google network members websites this had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period cost of revenues increased 2473 million from 2014 to 2015 the increase was primarily due to data center costs and an increase in content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content the remaining increase was driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of 846 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues as well as more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to our websites additionally there was an impairment charge of 378 million recognized in 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the motorola acquisition that did not recur in 2015 the decrease in aggregate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from google network members websites revenue to google websites revenuecost of revenues increased 3698 million from 2013 to 2014 the increase was partially due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of 1239 million resulting from more distribution fees paid for additional traffic directed to google websites as well as more advertiser fees paid to google network members driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues the remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs content acquisition costs as a result of increased usage activities related to youtube and digital content by our users and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers oems in addition the increase was also driven by the impairment charge described above the decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between google websites revenue and google network members websites revenuewe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in 2016 and future periods based on a number of factors including the followingthe relative growth rates of revenues from google websites and from our google network members websitethe growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations as well as our hardware inventory costsincreased proportion of other nonadvertising revenues as part of our total revenueswhether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with google network members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential google network members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangementswhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on google websites and our google network members websites andthe

revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investorscritical accounting policies and estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in doing so we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in some cases we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates in some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our financial condition or results of operations will be affected we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directorsplease see note 1 of part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for the summary of significant accounting policiesincome taxeswe are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxesalthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxesloss contingencieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy indirect taxes labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we evaluate on a monthly basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingenciesbusiness combinationswe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values 40table of contentsalphabet inc and google incof assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assetscritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimatesother estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10kgoodwillgoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as of december 31 2015 no impairment of goodwill has been identifiedlonglived assetslonglived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair valueimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable securitieswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable securities for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for marketable debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest ratesforeign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency as of december 31 2015 our most significant currency exposures are the british pound euro and japanese yenwe use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values changes in the time value are recorded in other income expense net changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the amount recorded in aoci reflecting intrinsic value related to our 41table of contentsalphabet inc and google incforeign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately 686 million and 280 million lower as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 90 million and 275 million higher in the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 if the us dollar strengthened by 20 as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately 25 billion and 31 billion higher as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 164 million and 372 million higher in the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 in both scenarios the change in the intrinsic value would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognizedin addition we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 93 million and 122 million as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the adverse impact as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately 948 million and 11 billion from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 interest rate riskour investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold we use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities these derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income expense net we considered the historical volatility of shortterm interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately 12 billion and 13 billion as of december 31 2014 and december 31 201542table of contentsalphabet

revenues from google other revenues to advertising revenues from google network members websites to conform with current period presentationwe generate revenues primarily by delivering performance and brand advertising performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers brand advertising enhances users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other ads that run across various devices google adwords is our auctionbased advertising program that enables performance advertisers to place textbased and display ads on google websites and our google network members websites google adsense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers adwords ads for display on our google network members websites most of our customers pay us on a costperclick basis which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user engages with the ads by clicking on an ad on google websites or google network members websites or by viewing youtube engagement ads like trueview counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad we also

specified by the advertisersrevenue from advertising is recognized when the services have been provided or delivered the fees we charge are fixed or determinable we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on google websites or our google network members websites for those advertisers using our costperimpression pricing we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on google websites or our google network members websites we report our google adsense revenues and traffic acquisition costs due to our google network members on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisersrevenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when products have been shipped risk of loss has transferred to the customer objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts price protection returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated revenues are reported net of these allowances where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer or when the return period elapsed as applicablefor the sale of certain thirdparty products and services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share generally when we record revenue on a gross basis we are the primary obligor in a transaction and have also considered other factors including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices for multielement arrangements including those that contain software essential to hardware products functionality and services we allocate revenue

assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying valuefair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair valuelevel 1  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratingslevel 3  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activitiesthe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value cash cash equivalents and marketable securitieswe invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governmentswe classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable

and accounted for our marketable securities as availableforsale after consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities as we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption

approximately 75 billion as of december 31 2015 the fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging privatemarket transactions and are classified within level 3

reflect these losses as a component of other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of incomewe determined that certain renewable energy investments included in our nonmarketable equity investments are vies however we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and account for those investments under the equity method our involvement with investments in renewable energy relate to our equity investments in entities whose activities involve power generation we have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the entitys economic performance such as setting operating budgets the carrying value of our renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method that are vies is 302 million as of december 31 2015 with the maximum exposure of 316 million the maximum exposure is based on current investments to date plus future funding commitments we have determined the single source of our exposure to these vies is our capital investment in these entities we periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie the reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie through changes in governing documents or other circumstances we also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be vies have become

income approaches based on prior transaction prices estimated timing probability and amount of cash flows and illiquidity considerations financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date we estimate a range of fair values based on valuation approaches noted above and as of

cade the canadian competition bureau ccb and the federal antimonopoly service fas of the russian federation have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices in august 2015 we received the cci director generals report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads in september 2015 fas found that there has been a competition law infringement in android mobile distribution we will respond to the ccis report and have filed an appeal of the fas decision in july 2015 the taiwan fair trade commission informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigations of our business practicesthe state attorney general from mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices we have responded to those subpoenas and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requestspatent and intellectual property claimswe have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business in addition the us international trade commission itc has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an itc action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the us since the us is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the us or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our productsfurthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our businessotherwe are also regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition such as the pending

that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss we evaluate on a monthly basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses

income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock assumes the conversion of class b common stock while the diluted net income per share of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those sharesthe rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock are identical except with respect to voting further there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as delaware law which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock specifically delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors as a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the class a and class b common shares and class c capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed as the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation further as we assume the conversion of class b common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computationstock split effected in form of stock dividendin january 2014 our board of directors approved the distribution of shares of class c capital stock

tax credit will be realizedas of december 31 2015 we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to investment losses that are capital in nature california deferred tax assets and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized we established a deferred tax asset for the booktotax basis difference in our investments in arris shares received from the sale of the motorola home business to arris in 2013 since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale of arris shares will be capital losses a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not covered by capital gains generated as of 2015 we reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded accordinglyas a result of the altera opinion we have recorded a deferred tax asset of 35 billion and a deferred tax liability of 35 billion refer to above for more details on the altera case uncertain tax positionsthe following table summarizes the activity related to our

million and 348 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxeswe file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions our two major tax jurisdictions are the us federal and ireland we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities the irs completed its examination of our 2003 through 2006 tax years all issues have been settled except for one which we have filed an appeal with the irs and plan to litigate in court the irs is currently in examination of our 2007 through 2012 tax years we have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment we continue to defend any and all such claims as presentedour 2013 2014 and 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the irs for us federal tax purposes and our 2011 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for irish tax purposes there are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statementswe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictionswe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs although the timing of resolution settlement closure of audits is not certain we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 monthsnote 16 information about segments and geographic areas in conjunction with the alphabet

and as a consequence we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of 711 million we have evaluated the materiality of the
