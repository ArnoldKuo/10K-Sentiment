iitem 1businessoverviewas our founders larry and sergey wrote in the original founders letter google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one as part of that they also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we haveto help accelerate this we announced plans in august 2015 to create a new public holding company called alphabet alphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that we combine as other bets and generally are pretty far afield of our main internet products such as verily calico x nest gv google capital and accessgoogle fiber our alphabet structure is about helping businesses within alphabet prosper through strong leaders and independence at google our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world we generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find costeffective googles core products such as search android maps chrome youtube google play and gmail each have over one billion monthly active users and we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface googles vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems our other bets are also making important strides in their industries and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the long termserving our users in many ways google search  and the clean white page with the blinking cursor  is a metaphor for how we think about innovation imagining the ways things could be  without constraint  is the process we use to look for better answers to some of lifes everyday problems its about starting with the what if and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answerits been that way from the beginning providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to google and our products have come a long way in the last decade we used to show just ten blue links in our results you had to click through to different websites to get your answers which took time now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers  even if youre speaking your question using voice search  which makes it quicker easier and more natural to find what youre looking forover time we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily what if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage thats gmail what if we could make a simpler speedier safer browser thats chrome what if we could provide easy access to movies books music and apps no matter which device youre on thats google play what if developers could use googles infrastructure to easily build and scale applications and what if people could collaborate and get work done from anywhere on any device thats cloud and appsas devices proliferate its more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them  that the technology gets out of the way so you can move through this multiscreen world as easily as possible its why were investing so much in platforms like our chrome browser chrome os and our android mobile operating system ultimately we want you to have speedy secure access to whatever you need wherever you happen to be and on whatever device you may be using at the timeads as answerswe asked what if ads werent intrusive and annoying what if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information what if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right peopleour advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices we generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertisingperformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results2table of contentsalphabet inc and google incfor performance advertisers adwords our primary auctionbased advertising program helps create simple textbased ads that appear on google websites and the websites of google network members who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content in addition our partners that comprise the google network use our adsense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience these programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home to that end we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades including estimated total conversions which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multiscreen worldbrand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns and in turn generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the trueview ads displayed on our youtube videoswe have built a worldclass ad technology platform for brand advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses we aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies we also seek to improve the measurability of the effectiveness of brand advertisingfurthermore we have invested significantly in programmatic advertising to help advertisers reach users when and where it matters giving them access to toptier inventory across screens and formats as well as the realtime insights that advertisers need to make their buys countwe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways ranging from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad contentbringing the next 5 billion onlinefast search and highquality ads matter only if you have access to the internet right now only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online that leaves out billions of people with so much useful and lifechanging information available today it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the worlds population lacks even the most basic internet connectionthose people will be able to learn and start businesses to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an internet connection creating platforms for other peoples success is a huge part of who we are we want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there connection is powerful and we are working hard to make it a reality for everyone the opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endlessand there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes into their schools and into their pockets  showing them just how powerful the simple idea of getting online can beat google we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets primarily through android and chrome were also making sure our core google apps are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed size and connectivity are central concernsother alphabet companies are pursuing initiatives with similar goals too thats why were investing in new projects like project loon we asked what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas loon has helped students in brazil and farmers in new zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time and as the program expands we hope to bring this to more and more people  creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people all around the worldmoonshotsthe idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new ambitious projects both within google and other bets everything might not fit into a neat little box we believe that is exactly how to stay relevant many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser respectively we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the longterm3table of contentsalphabet inc and google incwe wont become complacent relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on as we said in the 2004 founders ipo letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our longterm success we wont stop asking what if and then working hard to find the answeras explained in the letter from our ceo in august 2015 our alphabet reorganization was implemented to better allow us to structure teams in ways that we believe will produce the fastest most focused innovation possible for moonshot projectsresearchwe continue to invest in our existing products and services including search and advertising as well as developing new products and services through research and product development we often release earlystage products we then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those productsour research and development expenses which includes the vast majority of engineering and technical headcount responsible for research and development as well as their associated costs were 71 billion 98 billion and 123 billion in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which included stockbased compensation expense of 16 billion 22 billion and 27 billion respectively we expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and building systems to develop new products and services and improve existing onescompetitionour business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies we face formidable competition in every aspect of our business particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising we face competition fromgeneral purpose search engines and information services such as

ebay ecommerce some users will navigate directly to such content websites and apps rather than go through googlesocial networks such as facebook and twitter some users are increasingly relying on social networks for product or service referrals rather than seeking information through traditional search enginesother forms of advertising such as television radio newspapers magazines billboards

advertisers with adwords our primary auctionbased advertising programother operating systems and mobile device companiesproviders of online products and services that provide answers information and services a number of our online products and services including gmail youtube and google docs compete directly with new and established companies which offer communication information storage and entertainment services either on a standalone basis or integrated into other offeringscompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retainusers for whom other products and services are literally one click away primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features availability and ease of use of our products and servicesadvertisers primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads and ultimately customers and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channelscontent providers google network members the parties who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant

financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including those described below which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common and capital stockrisks related to our businesses and industrieswe face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected our businesses are rapidly evolving intensely competitive and subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and for google provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core businesswe have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce websites social networks providers of online products and services other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks other operating systems and wireless mobile device companies our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before usour competitors are constantly developing innovations in search online advertising wireless mobile devices operating systems and many other webbased products and services the research and development of new technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment as well as the accurate anticipation of technology market trends and consumer needs as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use if we are unable to provide quality products and services then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline in addition these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely affectedour ongoing investment in new businesses and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our ongoing businesseswe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments distraction of management from current operations and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating results6table of contentsalphabet inc and google incmore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet and accessing new devices to make search queries if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely affected the number of people who access the internet through devices other than desktop computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets video game consoles and television settop devices is increasing dramatically the functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult or just different and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms which could affect our search and advertising business over time as new devices and platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers distributors developers and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic multiscreen environmentwe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could seriously harm our businesswe generated 90 of total google segment revenues from advertising in 2015 many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives if we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on advertising revenues which could adversely affect our revenues and businessin addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and businessour revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the futureour revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors includingincreasing competitionchanges in property mix platform mix and geographical mixthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levelsthe evolution of the online advertising market including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising and the other markets in which we participate andthe rate of user adoption of our products services and technologieswe believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business for instance the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on google websites consequently our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on google websites additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network membersadditionally our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content and apps advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites or traditional formats further our margins could be impacted 7table of contentsalphabet inc and google incadversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our rampd efforts across the company such as our other bets businesses than we have historicallywe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business the growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown for instance several regulatory agencies have sought to review our search and other businesses on potential competition concerns we continue to cooperate with the european commission ec and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices these changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material wayswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property privacy consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters the sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects as well as health and safety hazardous materials usage and other environmental concerns in addition our businesses face intellectual property litigation as further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell products and servicessuch claims suits and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operationsacquisitions could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations acquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology has created and will continue to create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks includediversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challengesfailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technologyimplementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired companyintegration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functionstransition of operations users and customers onto our existing platformsfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval under competition laws which could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or investmentin the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries8table of contentsalphabet inc and

of both google and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical performance failures further if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the google brand our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in peoples everyday livesa variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business for example current and new patent laws such as us patent laws and european patent laws may affect the ability of companies including us to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the futureclaims have been or may be threatened and filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement product liability or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users furthermore many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses products services and technologies in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroadin addition other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include among othersthe digital millennium copyright act which has provisions that limit in the us but do not necessarily eliminate our liability for caching or hosting or for listing or linking to thirdparty websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact uscourt decisions such as the right to be forgotten ruling issued by the european court which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our usersvarious us and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minorsdata protection laws passed by many states that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices actdata localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored

additional regulations any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penaltieswe are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future internet technology media and other companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologieswe have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our businessfurthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities in addition many of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered productsregardless of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effectivealthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceablewe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secretswe also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brand10table of contentsalphabet inc and google incany significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our

provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the us and internationally

personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties

attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse mannerprivacy concerns relating to our

processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating resultsin addition as nearly all of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business we expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countriesregulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection including measures to ensure that our encryption of users data does not hinder law enforcement agencies access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessrecent legal developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us a preliminary agreement has been reached between the us and european governments to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data however given the preliminary nature of the agreement some uncertainty remains and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessif our security measures are breached or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities or otherwise additionally outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our 11table of contentsalphabet inc and google incdata or our users or customers data any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customerswe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results and prospects we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management for instance the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impactedwe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and we have thirdparty arrangements for the design of some components and parts our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with themwe have in the past and may experience in the future supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers workaround plans to address shortages could entail increased freight costs for expedited shipments we may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruptionadditionally because many of our supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supplywe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to thirdparty intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third partiesthe doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures pertaining to a manufacturers efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc conflict free components and parts and we may not be able to obtain drc conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our productsweb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services web spam refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engines quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engines assessment of their relevance and utility would rank themalthough englishlanguage web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced and web spam in most other languages is limited we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately we continuously combat web spam including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spamlike less useful web content to rank highly we face challenges from lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve 12table of contentsalphabet inc and google inctheir search rankings we are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on lowquality websites if our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites in addition as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce lowquality content this may in the short run reduce our adsense revenues since some of these websites are adsense partnersinterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating resultsthe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and

wildfires and increased storm severity power loss telecommunications failures computer viruses computer denial of service attacks or other attempts to harm our systems some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes our data centers are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision to close a facility we are using or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service in addition our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities which could result in interruptions in our services or the failure of our systemsour international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business operating results and financial conditionour international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenues accounted for approximately 54 of our consolidated revenues in 2015 in certain international markets we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeedin addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the followingchanges in local political economic regulatory tax social and labor conditions which may adversely harm our businessrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the usimport and export requirements tariffs trade disputes and barriers and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costslonger payment cycles in some countries increased credit risk and higher levels of payment fraudstill developing foreign laws and legal systemsuncertainty regarding liability for services and content including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedentdifferent employeeemployer relationships existence of workers councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictionsin addition compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules privacy and data protection requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brand our international growth efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies13table of contentsalphabet inc and google incfinally since we conduct business in currencies other than us dollars but report our financial results in us dollars we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings additionally hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operationsour operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectationsour operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control as a result comparing our operating results on a periodtoperiod basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance our quarterly yeartodate and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations any of these events could cause our stock price to fall each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating resultsour ability to continue to attract users to our websites and retain existing users on our websitesour ability to monetize or generate revenues from traffic on google websites and our google network members websites both on desktop and mobile devicesrevenue fluctuations caused by changes in property mix platform mix and geographical mixthe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than us dollars and our ability to manage

in which we have invested considerable time and resourcesbecause our business is changing and evolving our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results in addition advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns also user traffic tends to be seasonal our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business as our growth rate has slowed the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuateif we were to lose the services of larry sergey eric sundar or other key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategyour future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team in particular larry page and sergey brin are critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and they along with sundar pichai the chief executive officer of google play an important role in the development of our technology along with our executive chairman eric e schmidt they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies the loss of key personnel could seriously harm our businesswe rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectivelyour performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees14table of contentsalphabet inc and google incin addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures particularly in light of our holding company reorganization and new operating structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture this could negatively impact our future successour business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users internet access providers may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisersour products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and governmentowned service providers some of these providers have taken or have stated that they may take measures including legal actions that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings in addition in some jurisdictions our products and services have been subject to governmentinitiated restrictions or blockages such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers thereby harming our revenues and growthnew technologies could block online ads which would harm our google business technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products most of our google revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users as a result such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating resultswe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments given the global nature of our business we have investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and market values of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results foreign exchange rates or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultswe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is maderisks related to ownership of our stock the trading price for our class a common stock and nonvoting class c capital stock may continue to be volatilethe

operating performancewe cannot guarantee that our recently announced stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our stock repurchase program will enhance longterm stockholder value and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves in october 2015 our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to 509901951359 of our class c capital stock and in january 2016 our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares the repurchase program does not have an expiration date although our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the stock repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stockthe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders ability to influence corporate mattersour class b common stock has 10 votes

affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition because our class c capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c capital stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders together with eric they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving alphabet including an acquisition of alphabet by another companythis concentrated control limits or severely restricts
