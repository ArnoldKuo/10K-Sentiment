with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k trends in our businessthe following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future resultsusers behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolvesthe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception resulting in increasing revenues and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our businessas online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetizationas interactions between users and advertisers change we continue to expand our product offerings to serve their changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search desktop ads additionally advertisers are beginning to shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user in the right moment in the right context this may also have different monetization profiles to our existing advertising business these trends will continue to affect our monetization in the futureusers are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formatsour users are accessing the internet via multiple devices mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our businessin this multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets our traffic acquisition cost tac may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may differ from our traditional desktop and tablet formats we expect both of these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multiscreen environmentas users in developing economies increasingly come online we generate increasing revenues from international markets and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues22table of contentsalphabet inc and google incthe shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us especially in emerging markets and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more availableour international revenues represent a significant proportion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earningsthe portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasingnonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products like google play cloud and apps and hardware products across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from sales of digital content products hardware sales service and licensing fees the margins on these nonadvertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues themselves could be volatileas we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses we will invest heavily in rampd and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuatewe continue to make significant research and development rampd investments in areas of strategic focus for google such as search and advertising as well as in new products and services across both google and other bets the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems data centers real estate and facilities and information technology infrastructurein addition acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments

youtube and digital content by our users and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers oems in addition the increase was also driven by the impairment charge described above the decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between google websites revenue and google network members websites revenuewe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in 2016 and future periods based on a number of factors including the followingthe relative growth rates of revenues from google websites and from our google network members websitethe growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations as well as our hardware inventory costsincreased proportion of other nonadvertising revenues as part of our total revenueswhether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with google network members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential google network members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangementswhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on google websites and our google network members websites andthe

tax positions and determining our provision for income taxesalthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxesloss contingencieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy indirect taxes labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we evaluate on a monthly basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note 11 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingenciesbusiness combinationswe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values 40table of contentsalphabet inc and google incof assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assetscritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimatesother estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10kgoodwillgoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit as of december 31 2015 no impairment of goodwill has been identifiedlonglived assetslonglived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair valueimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable securitieswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable securities for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for marketable debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest ratesforeign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency as of december 31 2015 our most significant currency exposures are the british pound euro and japanese yenwe use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements we designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values changes in the time value are recorded in other income expense net changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20 could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 20 as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the amount recorded in aoci reflecting intrinsic value related to our 41table of contentsalphabet inc and google incforeign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately 686 million and 280 million lower as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 90 million and 275 million higher in the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 if the us dollar strengthened by 20 as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately 25 billion and 31 billion higher as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 164 million and 372 million higher in the years ended december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 in both scenarios the change in the intrinsic value would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognizedin addition we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 93 million and 122 million as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 the adverse impact as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately 948 million and 11 billion from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 interest rate riskour investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2015 unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold we use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities these derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income expense net we considered the historical volatility of shortterm interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately 12 billion and 13 billion as of december 31 2014 and december 31 201542table of contentsalphabet

advertisers to place textbased and display ads on google websites and our google network members websites google adsense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers

clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on google websites or our google network members websites for those advertisers using our costperimpression pricing we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on google websites or our google network members websites we report our google adsense revenues and traffic acquisition costs due to our google network members on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisersrevenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when products have been shipped risk of loss has transferred to the customer objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts price protection returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated revenues are reported net of these allowances where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer or when the return period elapsed as applicablefor the sale of certain thirdparty products and services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share generally when we record revenue on a gross basis we are the primary obligor in a transaction and have also considered other factors including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices for multielement arrangements including those that contain software essential to hardware products functionality and services we allocate revenue

assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying valuefair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair valuelevel 1  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratingslevel 3  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activitiesthe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value cash cash equivalents and marketable securitieswe invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governmentswe classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securitieswe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date we have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as availableforsale after consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities as we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for unrealized losses determined to be otherthantemporary which we record within other income expense net we determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities

investments that meet the definition of a debt security as availableforsale securities since these securities do not have contractual maturity dates and we do not intend to liquidate them in the next 12 months we have classified them as noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheetvariable interest entitieswe make a determination at the start of each arrangement whether an

interest in a vie we account for the investment under either the equity or cost methodimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable investmentswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable investments for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netaccounts receivablewe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables we review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues in determining the amount of the reserve we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations we also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers we determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issuedproperty and equipmentwe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally two to five years we depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use land is not depreciatedsoftware development costswe expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presentedsoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services we capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presentedbusiness combinationswe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition we allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwilllonglived assets including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetswe review property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be 62table of contentsalphabet inc and google increcoverable we measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate if the assets are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value in 2014 we recorded impairments of intangible assets including an impairment of 378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset impairments of intangible assets were not material in 2015we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired no goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presentedintangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives we amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straightline basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve yearsincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns we measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law we evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is morelikelythannot that they will not be realizedwe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is morelikelythan not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination the tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority in addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provisionforeign

cumulative amount of 711 million we evaluated the materiality of the income tax expense impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior periods impacted and that correction of income tax expense as an out of period adjustment in the quarter ended june 30 2015 would not be material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ending december

reflect these losses as a component of other income expense net in the accompanying consolidated statements of incomewe determined that certain renewable energy investments included in our nonmarketable equity investments are vies however we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vies economic performance and account for those investments under the equity method our involvement with investments in renewable energy relate to our equity investments in entities whose activities involve power generation we have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the entitys economic performance such as setting operating budgets the carrying value of our renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method that are vies is 302 million as of december 31 2015 with the maximum exposure of 316 million the maximum exposure is based on current investments to date plus future funding commitments we have determined the single source of our exposure to these vies is our capital investment in these entities we periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie the reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the vie through changes in governing documents or other circumstances we also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be vies have become vies based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure72table of contentsalphabet inc and google incnonmarketable debt securitiesour nonmarketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies these debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy to estimate the fair value of these securities we use a combination of valuation methodologies including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices estimated timing probability and amount of cash flows and illiquidity considerations financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date we estimate a range of fair values based on valuation approaches noted above and as of december 31 2014 and 2015 the fair value recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for individual investments is within the range no material impairments were recognized for the years ended december

awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business in addition the us international trade commission itc has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an itc action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the us since the us is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the us or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our productsfurthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us

common stock and class c capital stock using the twoclass method basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock assumes the conversion of class b common stock while the diluted net income per share of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those sharesthe rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock are identical except with respect to voting further there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as delaware law which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock specifically delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors as a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the class a and class b common shares and class c capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed as the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation further as we assume the conversion of class b common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computationstock split effected in form of stock dividendin january 2014 our board of directors approved the distribution of shares of class c capital stock as a dividend to our holders of class a and class b common stock the stock split the stock split had a record date of march 27 2014 and a payment date of april 2 2014 in the second quarter of 2015 in accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute class c capital stock at the close of trading on april 2 2015 the last trading day of the 365 day period following the first date the class c shares traded on nasdaq lookback period we determined that a payment the adjustment payment in the amount of 522 million was due to class c capital stockholders the amount

governmental agencies for irish tax purposes there are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statementswe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictionswe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs although the timing of resolution settlement closure of audits is not certain we do not believe it is
