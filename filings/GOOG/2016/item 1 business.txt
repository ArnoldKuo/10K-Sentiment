founders larry and sergey wrote in the original founders letter google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one as part of that they also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we haveto help accelerate this we announced plans in august 2015 to create a new public holding company called alphabet alphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that we combine as other bets and generally are pretty far afield of our main internet products such as verily calico x nest gv google capital and accessgoogle fiber our alphabet structure is about helping businesses within alphabet prosper through strong leaders and independence at google our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world we generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find costeffective googles core products such as search android maps chrome youtube google play and gmail each have over one billion monthly active users and we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface googles vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems our other bets are also making important strides in their industries and our goal is for them to become thriving successful businesses in the long termserving our users in many ways google search  and the clean white page with the blinking cursor  is a metaphor for how we think about innovation imagining the ways things could be  without constraint  is the process we use to look for better answers to some of lifes everyday problems its about starting with the what if and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answerits been that way from the beginning providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to google and our products have come a long way in the last decade we used to show just ten blue links in our results you had to click through to different websites to get your answers which took time now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers  even if youre speaking your question using voice search  which makes it quicker easier and more natural to find what youre looking forover time we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily what if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage thats gmail what if we could make a simpler speedier safer browser thats chrome what if we could provide easy access to movies books music and apps no matter which device youre on thats google play what if developers could use googles infrastructure to easily build and scale applications and what if people could collaborate and get work done from anywhere on any device thats cloud and appsas devices proliferate its more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them  that the technology gets out of the way so you can move through this multiscreen world as easily as possible its why were investing so much in platforms like our chrome browser chrome os and our android mobile operating system ultimately we want you to have speedy secure access to whatever you need wherever you happen to be and on whatever device you may be using at the timeads as answerswe asked what if ads werent intrusive and annoying what if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information what if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right peopleour advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices we generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertisingperformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results2table of contentsalphabet inc and google incfor performance advertisers adwords our primary auctionbased advertising program helps create simple textbased ads that appear on google websites and the websites of google network members who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content in addition our partners that comprise the google network use our adsense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience these programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home to that end we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades including estimated total conversions which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multiscreen worldbrand advertising helps enhance users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other interactive ads that run across various devices we help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brandbuilding marketing campaigns and in turn generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the trueview ads displayed on our youtube videoswe have built a worldclass ad technology platform for brand advertisers agencies and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses we aim to ensure great

advertisingfurthermore we have invested significantly in programmatic advertising to help advertisers reach users when and where it matters giving them access to toptier inventory across screens and formats as well as the realtime insights that advertisers need to make their buys countwe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web we focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways ranging from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad contentbringing the next 5 billion onlinefast search and highquality ads matter only if you have access to the internet right now only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online that leaves out billions of people with so much useful and lifechanging information available today it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the worlds population lacks even the most basic internet connectionthose people will be able to learn and start businesses to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an internet connection creating platforms for other peoples success is a huge part of who we are we want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there connection is powerful and we are working hard to make it a reality for everyone the opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endlessand there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes into their schools and into their pockets  showing them just how powerful the simple idea of getting online can beat google we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets primarily through android and chrome were also making sure our core google apps are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed size and connectivity are central concernsother alphabet companies are pursuing initiatives with similar goals too thats why were investing in new projects like project loon we asked what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas loon has helped students in brazil and farmers in new zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time and as the program expands we hope to bring this to more and more people  creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people all around the worldmoonshotsthe idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new ambitious projects both within google and other bets everything might not fit into a neat little box we believe that is exactly how to stay relevant many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser respectively we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the longterm3table of contentsalphabet inc and google incwe wont become complacent relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on as we said in the 2004 founders ipo letter we will not shy away from highrisk highreward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our longterm success we wont stop asking what if and then working hard to find the answeras explained in the letter from our ceo in august 2015 our alphabet reorganization was implemented to better allow
