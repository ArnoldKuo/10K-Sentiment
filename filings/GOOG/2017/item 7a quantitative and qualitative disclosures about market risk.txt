1businessoverviewas our founders larry and sergey wrote in the original founders letter google is not a conventional company we do not intend to become one that unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history  inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with android and map the world with google maps as part of that our founders also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we havealphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main internet products such as access calico capitalg gv nest verily waymo and x we report all nongoogle businesses collectively as other bets our alphabet structure is about

are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns other alphabet companies are also pursuing initiatives with similar goalsmoonshotsmany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser we continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the longterm we wont become complacent relying solely on small tweaks as we said in the original founders

artificial intelligence ai are increasingly driving many of our latest innovations within google our investments in machine learning over a decade are what have enabled us to build google products

1arisk factorsour operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described below which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common and capital stockrisks related to our businesses and industrieswe face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected our businesses are rapidly evolving intensely competitive and subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and for google provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively usewe have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce websites social networks other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks companies that design manufacture and market consumer electronic products providers of enterprise cloud services and digital video services and digital assistant providers our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups some large companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before usin addition new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely affectedwe generate substantially all of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could harm our business we generated 88 of total revenues from advertising in 2016 many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives if we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business in addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and businessour ongoing investment in new businesses and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies the creation of alphabet as a new holding company in 2015 and the investments that we are making across various areas in google and other bets are a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that 7table of contentsalphabet incare useful to users such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments distraction of management from current operations use of alternative investment or compensation structures and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating resultsmore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet and accessing new devices to make search queries if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely affected the number of people who access the internet through devices other than desktop computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as laptops and tablets video game consoles digital assistants and television settop devices is increasing dramatically the functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult or just different and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms which could affect our search and advertising business over time as new devices and platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers continue to exist in a dynamic multiscreen environmentour revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors includingincreasing competitionchanges in property mix platform mix device mix and geographical mixthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levelsthe evolution of the online advertising market including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising and the other markets in which we participate andthe rate of user adoption of our products services and technologieswe believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business as well as the continuing shift to mobile changes in device mix and the contribution of new businesses to overall revenue for instance the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on google properties consequently our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members properties compared to revenues generated through ads placed on google properties additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network members furthermore in our multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search we also expect our traffic acquisition costs tac paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile desktop and tablet partner mix partner agreement terms and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access pointsadditionally our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content hardware products and cloudbased services have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search further our margins could be impacted adversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote new products and services or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our innovation efforts across the company such as our other bets businesses than we have historically8table of contentsalphabet incwe are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business additionally changes in policies governing a wide range of topics may adversely affect our business the growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown for instance various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects of our search and other businesses we continue to cooperate with the european commission and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our businesslegislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws or policies in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices additionally changes in social political and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may disrupt our business practices these changes could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material waysa variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business for example current and new patent laws such as us patent laws and european patent laws may affect the ability of companies including us to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement similarly changes to copyright laws being considered in europe and elsewhere may increase costs or require companies including us to change or cease offering certain existing services the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the futureclaims have been or may be threatened and filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement product liability or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users furthermore many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses products services and technologies in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroadin addition other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include among otherswe rely on statutory safe harbors as set forth in the digital millennium copyright act in the united states and the ecommerce directive in europe against copyright liability for various linking caching and hosting activities any legislation or court rulings impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact usthe general data protection regulation coming into effect in europe in may of 2018 which creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for noncompliance significantlycourt decisions such as the right to be forgotten ruling issued by the european court which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdensvarious us and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minorsdata protection laws passed by many states and by certain countries outside the us that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices actdata localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that countrywe face risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penaltieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property privacy consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters the manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of hardware products further exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation as well as consumer protection concerns related to product defects as well as health and safety hazardous materials usage and other environmental concerns we may also be subject to claims including product warranty claims if users experience service disruptions failures or other issues in addition our businesses face intellectual property litigation 9table of contentsalphabet incas further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell products and servicessuch claims suits and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or corrections or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operationswe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content we host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the us and internationally claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright or trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort including personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties including our users in addition we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or thirdparty content that we have made available within our services violates us and nonus lawwe also place advertisements which are displayed on thirdparty publishers and advertising networks properties and we offer thirdparty products services or content we may be subject to claims concerning these products services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing branding broadcasting or providing access to them even if we do not ourselves host operate provide or provide access to these products services or content defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse mannerprivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services from time to time concerns have been expressed about whether our products services or processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating resultsin addition as nearly all of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business and impair our ability to attract and retain users we expect to continue to expend significant resources to create worldclass security protections that shield against theft and security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries and as cyber attacks by third parties become more sophisticated and targetedregulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection including measures to ensure that our encryption of users data does not hinder law enforcement agencies access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessrecent legal developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us for example the european union and us privacy shield framework was designed to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data however the agreement itself faces a number of legal challenges 10table of contentsalphabet incand is subject to annual review this has resulted in some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessif our security measures are breached resulting in the improper use and disclosure of user data or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and theft and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information improper use and disclosure of such information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities including vulnerabilities of our vendors or otherwise such breach or unauthorized access increased government surveillance or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users or customers data could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customerswe are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future internet technology media and other companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologieswe have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our businessmany of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilitiesregardless of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country 11table of contentsalphabet incin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceablewe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets we also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brandany significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating resultsacquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions effecting these potential strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks includediversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactionsfailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technologyimplementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired companyintegration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functionstransition of operations users and customers onto our existing platformsfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or other strategic transactionin the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countriescultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquireliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims privacy issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilitieslitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third partiesour failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generallyour acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or results also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which may adversely impact our financial condition or results 12table of contentsalphabet incour business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers google network members and other partners our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brands of both google and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors including among others reputational issues and producttechnical performance failures further if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the google brand our business operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide highquality innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in peoples everyday liveswe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results and prospects we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management we may enter into long term contracts that commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply we may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescences quality product recalls and warranty issues for instance the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impactedwe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and we have thirdparty arrangements for the design of some components and parts our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with themwe have in the past and may experience in the future supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers we may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruptionadditionally because many of our supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supplywe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to thirdparty intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third partiesthe doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures pertaining to a manufacturers efforts regarding the source of such minerals sec rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply drc conflict

lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings we are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on lowquality websites if our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant

risks that could harm our business operating results and financial conditionour international operations are significant to our revenues and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenues accounted for approximately 53 of our consolidated revenues in 2016 in certain international markets we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any firsttomarket advantages or otherwise succeedin addition to risks described elsewhere in this section our international operations expose us to other risks including the followingrestrictions on foreign ownership and investments and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the usimport and export requirements tariffs trade disputes and barriers and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costslonger payment cycles in

a result of local laws and lack of legal precedentdifferent employeeemployer relationships existence of workers councils and labor unions and other challenges caused by distance language and cultural differences making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictionsadditionally changes in international local political economic regulatory tax social and labor conditions may adversely harm our business and compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include among others internal control and disclosure rules privacy and data protection requirements anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our

risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operationsour operating results may fluctuate which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectationsour operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors many outside of our control as a result comparing our operating

user traffic tends to be seasonal our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business as our growth rate has slowed the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuateif we were to lose the services of larry sergey eric sundar or other key personnel we may not be able to execute our business strategyour future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team in particular larry page and sergey brin are critical to the overall management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and they along with sundar pichai the chief executive officer of google play an important role in the development of our technology along with our executive chairman eric e schmidt they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not maintain any keyperson life insurance policies the loss of key personnel could seriously harm our businesswe rely on highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture we may not be able to grow effectivelyour performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employeesin addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management

and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we

prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a
