condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k trends in our businessthe following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future resultsusers behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolvesthe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception resulting in increasing revenues and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our businessas online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetizationas interactions between users and advertisers change we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads which monetize at a lower rate than traditional desktop search ads additionally we continue to see a shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user in the right moment in the right context programmatic buying has a different monetization profile than traditional advertising buying on google properties these trends will continue to affect our revenues and margins in the futureusers are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile and other new formatsour users are accessing the internet via multiple devices and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our businessin this multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search we also expect traffic acquisition costs tac paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile desktop and tablet partner mix partner agreement terms and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points we expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall marginsas users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenuesthe shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us including in emerging markets and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more availableour international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earningsthe portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasingnonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud google play and hardware products across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from hardware sales sales of apps inapp purchases and digital content products and service and licensing fees the margins on these nonadvertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile22table of contentsalphabet incas we continue

by an increase in interest income and decreased losses on nonmarketable investments partially offset by increased losses from our foreign currency transactions and impairments for certain assets other income expense net decreased 472 million from 2014 to 2015 this decrease was primarily related to a writedown of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business as well as reduced gains on nonmarketable investments as compared to 2014 these decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investmentsthe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized in other income expense net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration the movement

liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in some cases we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates in some cases changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual results could differ materially from our estimates to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results our financial condition or results of operations will be affected we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directorsplease see note 1 of part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for the summary of significant accounting policiesincome taxeswe are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxesalthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxesloss contingencieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy indirect taxes labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our business consolidated

assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assetscritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimatesother estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as more fully discussed in note 6 of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10kgoodwillgoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit longlived assetslonglived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair valueimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable securitieswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable securities for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for marketable debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest ratesforeign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency as of december 31 2016 our most significant currency exposures are the british pound euro and japanese yenin the fourth quarter of 2016 we began using foreign exchange forward contracts in addition to the existing foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates when the us dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings when the us dollar weakens losses from foreign currency forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes we record spottospot foreign currency exchange rate changes of these 37table of contentsalphabet inccontracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur we exclude the change in the time value and forward points of these contracts from our assessment of hedge effectiveness these excluded components are recognized in other income expense netwe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 10 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the amount recorded in aoci reflecting spottospot foreign currency rate changes related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 221 million and 920 million lower as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 203 million higher in the year ended december 31 2015 and 14 million lower in the year ended december 31 2016 if the us dollar strengthened by 10 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 15 billion and 10 billion higher as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 313 million and 13 million higher in the years ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 in both scenarios the change in the value recorded in in aoci would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognizedin addition we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 61 million and 40 million as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the adverse impact as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately 539 million and 554 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 interest rate riskour investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold we use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities these derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income expense net we considered the historical volatility of shortterm interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately 13 billion and 22 billion as of december 31 2015 and december 31 201638table of contentsalphabet incitem

result alphabet became the successor issuer to google inc googlethe implementation of the holding company reorganization on october 2 2015 was accounted for as a merger under common control alphabet

advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click leading to direct engagement with advertisers brand advertising enhances users awareness of and affinity with advertisers products and services through videos text images and other ads that run across various devices google properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues generated on googlecom the google app youtube and other google owned and operated properties like gmail maps and google play google network members properties revenues consist primarily of revenues generated from placing ads on google network members 47table of contentsalphabet incproperties our customers generally purchase ads through adwords doubleclick bid manager and doubleclick adexchange among others most of our customers pay us on a costperclick basis which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user engages with the ads by clicking on an ad on google properties or google network members properties or by viewing youtube engagement ads like trueview counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad we also offer advertising on other bases such as costperimpression which enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads are displayed on google properties and google network members propertiesrevenue from advertising is recognized when the goods or services have been delivered or provided the amounts we charge are fixed or determinable we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize as revenues the amounts charged to advertisers each time a user engages with ads that appears next to the search results or content on google properties or google network members properties for those advertisers using our costperimpression pricing we recognize as revenues the amounts charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on google properties or google network members properties we generally report revenues from ads placed on google network members properties on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisersrevenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has transferred to the customer objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts price protection returns and customer incentives if applicable can be reasonably and reliably estimated revenues are reported net of these allowancesfor the sale of certain thirdparty products and services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share generally when we record revenue on a gross basis we are the primary obligor in a transaction and have also considered other factors including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices for multielement arrangements including those that contain software essential to hardware products functionality and services we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price and iii best estimate of the selling price esp vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling price of the deliverable would be if it was sold regularly on a standalone basiswe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying consolidated balance sheetscost of revenuescost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are paid to google network members primarily for ads displayed on their properties

actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of rsus outstanding we record a liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us primarily as a reduction to additional paidin capitalcertain risks and concentrationsour revenues are primarily derived from online advertising the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing in addition our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating resultswe are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents marketable securities foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits money market and other funds highly liquid debt instruments of the us government and its agencies debt instruments issued by foreign governments debt instruments issued by municipalities in the us corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities and assetbacked securities foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world in 2014 2015 and 2016 we generated approximately 45 46 and 47 of our revenues from customers based in the us with the majority of revenues from customers outside of the us located in europe and japan we perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend but generally we do not require collateral from our customers we maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectationsno individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10 of our revenues in 2014 2015 or 2016fair value of financial instrumentsour financial assets and financial liabilities including cash equivalents marketable securities foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts and nonmarketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis we measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes as well as on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying valuefair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair valuelevel 1  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratingslevel 3  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activitiesthe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value cash cash equivalents and marketable securitieswe invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments49table of contentsalphabet incwe classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securitieswe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date we have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as availableforsale after consideration of our risk versus reward objectives as well as our liquidity requirements we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities as we view these securities as available to support current operations we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets we carry these securities at fair value and report the unrealized gains and losses net of taxes as a component of stockholders equity except for unrealized losses determined to be otherthantemporary which we record within other income expense net we determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income

have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost methodwe have accounted for our nonmarketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as availableforsale securities since these securities do not have contractual maturity dates and we do not intend to liquidate them in the next 12 months we have classified them as noncurrent assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheetvariable interest entitieswe make a determination at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity vie we consolidate vies when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that meets both of the following criteria i has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie periodically we determine whether any changes occurred requiring a reassessment of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie if we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a vie we account for the investment or other variable interests in a vie in accordance with applicable gaapimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable investmentswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable investments for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netaccounts receivablewe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables we review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues in determining the amount of the reserve we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations we also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers we determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issuedproperty and equipmentwe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years we generally depreciate information technology assets over periods up to 7 years we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed 50table of contentsalphabet incin service for our intended use depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use land is not depreciatedinventoryinventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value cost is computed using the firstin firstout methodsoftware development costswe expense software development costs including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be sold leased or marketed to external users before technological feasibility is reached technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presentedsoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services we capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presentedbusiness combinationswe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values the excess of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill acquisitionrelated expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurredlonglived assets goodwill and other acquired intangible assetswe review property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate if the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value in 2014 we recorded impairments of intangible assets including an impairment of 378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset impairments of intangible assets were not material in 2015 or 2016we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired no goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presentedintangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives we amortize intangible assets on a straightline basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve yearsincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns we measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law we evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is morelikelythannot that they will not be realizedwe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is morelikelythan not that based on technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination the tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority in addition we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision51table of contentsalphabet incforeign currencygenerally the functional currency of our international

infringe the intellectual property rights of others adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business in addition the us international trade commission itc has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an itc action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the us because the us is an important market a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the us or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our productsfurthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our

per share of class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock using the twoclass method basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock assumes the conversion of class b common stock while the diluted net income per share of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those sharesthe rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock are identical except with respect to voting further there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as delaware law which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock specifically delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors as a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the class a and class b common shares and class c capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed as the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation further as we assume the conversion of class b common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computationin the years ended december 31 2014 and 2016 the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of alphabet incin the year ended december 31 2015 the class c adjustment payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of class c capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock the weightedaverage share impact of the class c adjustment payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the year ended december 31 2015 the following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of class a and class b common stock and class c

we have not recognized deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of 607 billion of undistributed earnings and other basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries we intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the us if such earnings and other basis differences in our investment foreign subsidiaries were to be repatriated in the future they would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicableon july 27 2015 the united states tax court in an opinion in altera corp v commissioner invalidated the portion of the treasury

the opinion and continue to record a tax benefit in 2016 related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stockbased compensation costs in addition we continue to record a tax liability for the us tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that the company has the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings the net impact to our consolidated financial statements is not material we will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the

from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictionswe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs although the timing of resolution settlement closure of audits is not certain it is reasonably possible that certain us federal and nonus tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefitswe estimate that our
