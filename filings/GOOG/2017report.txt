intend to become one that unconventional spirit has been a driving force throughout our history  inspiring us to do things like rethink the mobile device ecosystem with android and map the world with google maps as part of that our founders also explained that you could expect us to make smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses from the start the company has always strived to do more and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we havealphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which of course is google it also includes businesses that are generally pretty far afield of our main internet products such as access calico capitalg gv nest verily waymo and x we report all nongoogle businesses

worlds most powerful equalizers and we see it as our job to make it available to as many people as possible at its core google has always been an information company we believe that technology is a democratizing force empowering people through information we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets primarily through android and chrome were also making sure our core google products are fast and useful especially for users in areas where speed and connectivity are central concerns other alphabet companies are also pursuing initiatives with similar goalsmoonshotsmany companies get comfortable doing what they have always done making only incremental changes this incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time especially in technology where change tends to be revolutionary not evolutionary people thought we were crazy when we acquired youtube and android and when we launched chrome but those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices and a safer popular browser we continue to look toward the future and continue to invest for the longterm we wont become complacent

adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and the trading price of our common and capital stockrisks related to our businesses and industrieswe face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users we may not remain competitive and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected our businesses are rapidly evolving intensely competitive and subject to changing technologies shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and for google provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users as our businesses evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business as a result we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development including through acquisitions in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively usewe have many competitors in different industries including general purpose search engines and information services vertical search engines and ecommerce websites social networks other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks companies that design manufacture and market consumer electronic products providers of enterprise cloud services and digital video services and digital assistant providers our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging startups some large companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisitions continuing to invest heavily in research and development aggressively initiating intellectual property claims whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites emerging startups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before usin addition new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users advertisers and google network members are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market as technology continues to develop our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive if our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users advertisers and content providers our revenues and operating results could be adversely affectedwe generate substantially all of our revenues from advertising and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could harm our business we generated 88 of total revenues from advertising in 2016 many of our advertisers companies that distribute our products and services digital publishers and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value such as increased numbers of users or customers new sales leads increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternatives if we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business in addition expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising which could adversely affect our revenues and businessour ongoing investment in new businesses and new products services and technologies is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operations we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses products services and technologies the creation of alphabet as a new holding company in 2015 and the investments that we are making across various areas in google and other bets are a reflection of our ongoing efforts to innovate and provide products and services that 7table of contentsalphabet incare useful to users such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments inadequate return of capital on our investments distraction of management from current operations use of alternative investment or compensation structures and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities because these new ventures are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating resultsmore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the internet and accessing new devices to make search queries if manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology products or operating systems developed for these devices our business could be adversely affected the number of people who access the internet through devices other than desktop computers including mobile phones smartphones handheld computers such as laptops and tablets video game consoles digital assistants and television settop devices is increasing dramatically the functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult or just different and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users manufacturers or distributors of alternative devices each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices in addition search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored to particular devices or social media platforms which could affect our search and advertising business over time as new devices and platforms are continually being released it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services we expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation support and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices if we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers suppliers distributors developers and users to our products and services or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers continue to exist in a dynamic multiscreen environmentour revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future our revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors includingincreasing competitionchanges in property mix platform mix device mix and geographical mixthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levelsthe evolution of the online advertising market including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising and the other markets in which we participate andthe rate of user adoption of our products services and technologieswe believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business as well as the continuing shift to mobile changes in device mix and the contribution of new businesses to overall revenue for instance the margin on revenues we generate from our google network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on google properties consequently our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our google network members properties compared to revenues generated through ads placed on google properties additionally the margin we earn on revenues generated from our google network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our google network members furthermore in our multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search we also expect our traffic acquisition costs tac paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile desktop and tablet partner mix partner agreement terms and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access pointsadditionally our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content hardware products and cloudbased services have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search further our margins could be impacted adversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote new products and services or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our innovation efforts across the company such as our other bets businesses than we have historically8table of contentsalphabet incwe are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business additionally changes in policies governing a wide range of topics may adversely affect our business the growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown for instance various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects of our search and other businesses we continue to cooperate with the european commission and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our businesslegislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes or interpret and apply existing laws or policies in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users require us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause us to change our business practices additionally changes in social political and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics may disrupt our business practices these changes could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material waysa variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters new laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations may also impact our business for example current and new patent laws such as us patent laws and european patent laws may affect the ability of companies including us to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement similarly changes to copyright laws being considered in europe and elsewhere may increase costs or require companies including us to change or cease offering certain existing services the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the futureclaims have been or may be threatened and filed against us under both us and foreign laws for defamation invasion of privacy and other tort claims unlawful activity patent copyright and trademark infringement product liability or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users our products and services or content generated by our users furthermore many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses products services and technologies in addition the applicability and scope of these laws as interpreted by the courts remain uncertain for example the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the us and abroadin addition other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include among otherswe rely on statutory safe harbors as set forth in the digital millennium copyright act in the united states and the ecommerce directive in europe against copyright liability for various linking caching and hosting activities any legislation or court rulings impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact usthe general data protection regulation coming into effect in europe in may of 2018 which creates a range of new compliance obligations and increases financial penalties for noncompliance significantlycourt decisions such as the right to be forgotten ruling issued by the european court which allows individuals to demand that google remove search results about them in certain instances may limit the content we can show to our users and impose significant operational burdensvarious us and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minorsdata protection laws passed by many states and by certain countries outside the us that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data such as californias information practices actdata localization laws which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored andor processed within that countrywe face risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penaltieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes we are regularly subject to claims suits and government investigations involving competition intellectual property privacy consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters the manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of hardware products further exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation as well as consumer

claims if users experience service disruptions failures or other issues in addition our businesses face intellectual property litigation 9table of contentsalphabet incas further discussed later that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell products and servicessuch claims suits and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that requires significant judgment it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows in a particular period these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or corrections or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operationswe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content we host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information advertise products and services conduct business and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally the law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the us and internationally claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation negligence breaches of contract copyright or trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort including personal injury fraud or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties including our users in addition we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or thirdparty content that we have made available within our services violates us and nonus lawwe also place advertisements which are displayed on thirdparty publishers and advertising networks properties and we offer thirdparty products services or content we may be subject to claims concerning these products services or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing branding broadcasting or providing access to them even if we do not ourselves host operate provide or provide access to these products services or content defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources may result in monetary liabilities or penalties and may require us to change our business in an adverse mannerprivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services from time to time concerns have been expressed about whether our products services or processes compromise the privacy of users and others concerns about our practices with regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal information or other privacy related matters even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating resultsin addition as nearly all of our products and services are webbased the amount of data we store for our users on our servers including personal information has been increasing any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users data could seriously harm our reputation and brand and therefore our business and impair our ability to attract and retain users we expect to continue to expend significant resources to create worldclass security protections that shield against theft and security breaches the risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of webbased products and services we offer and operate in more countries and as cyber attacks by third parties become more sophisticated and targetedregulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection including measures to ensure that our encryption of users data does not hinder law enforcement agencies access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so in addition to the possibility of fines this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessrecent legal developments in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from europe to the us for example the european union and us privacy shield framework was designed to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data however the agreement itself faces a number of legal challenges 10table of contentsalphabet incand is subject to annual review this has resulted in some uncertainty and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our businessif our security measures are breached resulting in the improper use and disclosure of user data or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services our products and services may be perceived as not being secure users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure our products and services involve the storage and transmission of users and customers proprietary information and theft and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information improper use and disclosure of such information litigation and potential liability we experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis our security measures may also be breached due to employee error malfeasance system errors or vulnerabilities including vulnerabilities of our vendors or otherwise such breach or unauthorized access increased government surveillance or attempts by outside parties to fraudulently induce employees users or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users or customers data could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customerswe are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claims which are costly to defend could result in significant damage awards and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future internet technology media and other companies own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as we have grown the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products services and technologieswe have had patent copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products services and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in us and international courts and the us international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist orders which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the us or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages costly royalty or licensing agreements if licenses are available at all or orders preventing us from offering certain features functionalities products or services and may also cause us to change our business practices and require development of noninfringing products or technologies which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our businessmany of our agreements with our customers and partners including certain suppliers require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business moreover intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers when obtainable may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products furthermore in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilitiesregardless of the merits of the claims intellectual property claims are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flowsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brand our patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products services and technologies for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country 11table of contentsalphabet incin which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet also the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our efforts that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceablewe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets the secrecy could be compromised by outside parties or by our employees which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets we also face risks associated with our trademarks for example there is a risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own products thus diminishing our brandany significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating resultsacquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures could result in operating difficulties dilution and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations acquisitions joint ventures investments and divestitures are important elements of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions effecting these potential strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures the areas where we face risks includediversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenges related to acquisitions and other strategic transactionsfailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technologyimplementation or remediation of controls procedures and policies at the acquired companyintegration of the acquired companys accounting human resource and other administrative systems and coordination of product engineering and sales and marketing functionstransition of operations users and customers onto our existing platformsfailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or other strategic transactionin the case of foreign acquisitions the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risks associated with specific countriescultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employees from the businesses we acquireliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claims privacy issues violations of laws commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilitieslitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company including claims from terminated employees customers former stockholders or other third partiesour failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and other strategic transactions could cause us to fail to realize their anticipated benefits incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generallyour acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or impairment of goodwill andor purchased longlived assets and restructuring charges any of which could harm our financial condition or results also the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not materialize in connection with our divestitures we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities which may adversely impact our financial condition or results 12table of contentsalphabet incour business depends on strong brands and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users advertisers google network members and other partners our strong brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brands of both google and other bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users our brands may be negatively

commit us to significant terms and conditions of supply we may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescences quality product recalls and warranty issues for instance the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations or our products are found to be defective then our sales and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively impactedwe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products and we have thirdparty arrangements for the design of some components and parts our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with themwe have in the past and may experience in the future supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortages industry allocations natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers we may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations in addition some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruptionadditionally because many of our supply contracts have volumebased pricing or minimum purchase requirements if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results further certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supplywe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to key relationships and damage to our reputation if any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to thirdparty intellectual property legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third partiesthe doddfrank wall

lowquality and irrelevant content websites including content farms which are websites that generate large quantities of lowquality content to help them improve their search rankings we are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on lowquality websites if our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant

management of alphabet and its subsidiaries and they along with sundar pichai the chief executive officer of google play an important role in the development of our technology along with our executive chairman eric e schmidt they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction all of our executive officers and key employees are atwill employees and we do not

intense and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees in addition our compensation arrangements such as our equity award programs may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employeesin addition we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation creativity and teamwork as our organization grows and we are required to implement more complex organizational management

exchange risk management program changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items due to shifting economic and political conditions tax policies or rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change in addition we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as a result we have received and may in the future receive assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various taxrelated assertions including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we

stock repurchase program the share repurchase program does not obligate alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the stock repurchase program could

of our outstanding capital stock larry sergey and eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets for the foreseeable future in addition because our class c capital stock carries no voting rights except as required by applicable law the issuance of the class c capital stock including in future stockbased acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs could prolong the duration of larry and sergeys current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders together with eric they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving alphabet

results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item 8 of this annual report on form 10k trends in our businessthe following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future resultsusers behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolvesthe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception resulting in increasing revenues and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our businessas online advertising evolves we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetizationas interactions between users and advertisers change we continue to expand and evolve our product offerings to serve their changing needs over time we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate for example we have seen an increase in youtube engagement ads which monetize at a lower rate than traditional desktop search ads additionally we continue to see a shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user in the right moment in the right context programmatic buying has a different monetization profile than traditional advertising buying on google properties these trends will continue to affect our revenues and margins in the futureusers are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile and other new formatsour users are accessing the internet via multiple devices and want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing we seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our businessin this multidevice world we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search we also expect traffic acquisition costs tac paid to our distribution partners to increase due to changes in device mix between mobile desktop and tablet partner mix partner agreement terms and the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points we expect these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall marginsas users in developing economies increasingly come online our revenues from international markets continue to increase and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenuesthe shift to online as well as the advent of the multidevice world has brought opportunities outside of the us including in emerging markets and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets this has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets particularly as lowcost mobile devices become more availableour international revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar while we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earningsthe portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues is increasingnonadvertising revenues have grown over time we expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our google offerings to our users through products and services like google cloud google play and hardware products across these initiatives we currently derive nonadvertising revenues primarily from hardware sales sales of apps inapp purchases and digital content products and service and licensing fees the margins on these nonadvertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business a number of our other bets initiatives are in their initial development stages and as such the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues could be volatile22table of contentsalphabet incas we continue to

members tac rate was primarily driven by the shift in advertising buying from our traditional network business to programmatic advertising buyingcost of revenues increased 2473 million from 2014 to 2015 the increase was primarily due to data center costs and an increase in content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to youtube and digital content the remaining increase was driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of 846 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our adsense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues as well as more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to our websites additionally there was an impairment charge of 378 million recognized in 2014 related to a patent

material differences between these estimates and actual results our financial condition or results of operations will be affected we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates which we discuss further below we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directorsplease see note 1 of part ii item 8 of this annual report on

uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxesalthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxesloss contingencieswe are regularly subject to claims suits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy indirect taxes labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms and other matters certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the notes to the consolidated financial statements we evaluate on a regular basis developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters until the final resolution of such matters there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded and such amounts could be material should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect it could have a material impact on our business consolidated

assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill when determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed management makes significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assetscritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimatesother

evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment tests require judgment including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit longlived assetslonglived assets including property and equipment longterm prepayments and intangible assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair valueimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable securitieswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable securities for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for marketable debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netitem 7aquantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risks including changes in currency exchange rates and interest ratesforeign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currencies our international revenues as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the us dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency as of december 31 2016 our most significant currency exposures are the british pound euro and japanese yenin the fourth quarter of 2016 we began using foreign exchange forward contracts in addition to the existing foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from changes in foreign currency exchange rates when the us dollar strengthens gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related to our earnings when the us dollar weakens losses from foreign currency forwards offset the foreign currency gains related to our earnings these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes we record spottospot foreign currency exchange rate changes of these 37table of contentsalphabet inccontracts as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur we exclude the change in the time value and forward points of these contracts from our assessment of hedge effectiveness these excluded components are recognized in other income expense netwe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 10 could be experienced in the near term if the us dollar weakened by 10 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the amount recorded in aoci reflecting spottospot foreign currency rate changes related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 221 million and 920 million lower as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 203 million higher in the year ended december 31 2015 and 14 million lower in the year ended december 31 2016 if the us dollar strengthened by 10 as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the amount recorded in accumulated aoci related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately 15 billion and 10 billion higher as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 and the total amount of expense recorded as other income expense net would have been approximately 313 million and 13 million higher in the years ended december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 in both scenarios the change in the value recorded in in aoci would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognizedin addition we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 10 were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 61 million and 40 million as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 the adverse impact as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately 539 million and 554 million from foreign exchange contracts in

requirements we invest primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its agencies corporate debt securities agency mortgagebacked securities money market and other funds municipal securities time deposits asset backed securities and debt instruments issued by foreign governments by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2016 unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in aoci until the securities are sold we use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities these derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income expense net we considered the historical volatility of shortterm interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term a hypothetical 100 100 basis points increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately 13 billion and 22 billion as of december 31 2015 and december 31 201638table of contentsalphabet incitem

costperclick basis which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user engages with the ads by clicking on an ad on google properties or google network members properties or by viewing youtube engagement ads like trueview counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad we also offer advertising on other bases such as costperimpression which enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads are displayed on google properties and google network members propertiesrevenue from advertising is recognized when the goods or services have been delivered or provided the amounts we charge are fixed or determinable we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize as revenues the amounts charged to advertisers each time a user engages with ads that appears next to the search results or content on google properties or google network members properties for those advertisers using our costperimpression pricing we recognize as revenues the amounts charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on google properties or google network members properties we generally report revenues from ads placed on google network members properties on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisersrevenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when the product has been shipped risk of loss has transferred to the customer objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts price protection returns and customer incentives if applicable can be reasonably and reliably estimated revenues are reported net of these allowancesfor the sale of certain thirdparty products and services we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share generally when we record revenue on a gross basis we are the primary obligor in a transaction and have also considered other factors including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices for multielement arrangements including those that contain software essential to hardware products functionality and services we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices in such circumstances we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue i vendorspecific objective evidence of fair value vsoe ii thirdparty evidence of selling price and iii best estimate of the selling price

capitalcertain risks and concentrationsour revenues are primarily derived from online advertising the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing in addition our revenues are generated

representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a threetier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair valuelevel 1  observable inputs that reflect quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2  include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using marketbased observable inputs including interest rate curves foreign exchange rates and credit ratingslevel 3  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activitiesthe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value cash cash equivalents and marketable securitieswe invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the us government and its

affect the economic performance of the vie and ii has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie periodically we

investment or other variable interests in a vie in accordance with applicable gaapimpairment of marketable and nonmarketable investmentswe periodically review our marketable and nonmarketable investments for impairment if we conclude that any of these investments are impaired we determine whether such impairment is otherthantemporary factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell for debt securities we also consider whether 1 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis and 2 the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses if any impairment is considered otherthantemporary we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income expense netaccounts receivablewe record accounts

recoverable we measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate if the carrying value of the assets are not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value in 2014 we recorded impairments of intangible assets including an impairment of 378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset impairments of intangible assets were not material in

prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us including preventing us from importing many important products into the us or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our productsfurthermore many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them which would increase our

per share of class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock using the twoclass method basic net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weightedaverage number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options restricted stock units and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock assumes the conversion of class b common stock while the diluted net income per share of class b common stock does not assume the conversion of those sharesthe rights including the liquidation and dividend rights of the holders of our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock are identical except with respect to voting further there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation as well as delaware law which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock specifically delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights powers or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment in addition our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors as a result the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the class a and class b common shares and class c capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed as the liquidation and dividend rights are identical the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation further as we assume the conversion of class b common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of class a common stock the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computationin the years ended december 31 2014 and 2016 the net income per share amounts are the same for class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with the amended and restated certificate of incorporation of alphabet incin the year ended december 31 2015 the class c adjustment payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of class c capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to class a and class b common stock and class c capital stock based on the number of

we have not recognized deferred us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on a cumulative total of 607 billion of undistributed earnings and other basis differences in our foreign subsidiaries we intend to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and other basis differences in operations outside the us if such earnings and other basis differences in our investment foreign subsidiaries were to be repatriated in the future they would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes determining the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to such investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested is not practicableon july 27 2015 the united states tax court in an opinion in altera corp v commissioner invalidated the portion of the treasury

the opinion and continue to record a tax benefit in 2016 related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stockbased compensation costs in addition we continue to record a tax liability for the us tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that the company has the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings the net impact to our consolidated financial statements is not material we will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the

reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance a tax benefit will be recorded accordinglyas a result of the altera

two major tax jurisdictions are the us federal and ireland we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the irs and other tax authorities the irs completed its examination

for irish tax purposes there are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statementswe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictionswe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations however the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty if any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs although the timing of resolution settlement closure of audits is not certain it is reasonably possible that certain us federal and nonus tax audits may be concluded within the next 12 months which could significantly increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefitswe estimate that our
