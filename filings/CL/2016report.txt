officers and its proxy statementsitem 1a risk factorsin addition to the risks described elsewhere in this report set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of volatile commodity prices including the price of oillack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operateforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions price controls labor laws profit controls or other government controlsthese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 4in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operationssignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroadnew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide and colgate total toothpaste is subject to the fdas rigorous new drug application nda process for safety and efficacy triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european unions regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018 the fda is also evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers some states and municipalities in the us have proposed and minnesota has passed legislation banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste environment canada the federal environmental authority in canada is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in 2016 a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 5while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statementsincreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents in item 1 businesswe may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels for our products such as ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionthe growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullyidentify develop and fund technological innovationsobtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertisingthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 6if in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe on a third partys intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring programin the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in 2014 and 2015 the 2012 restructuring program the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results

regarding our fundingthegrowth initiatives refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlookdamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumersadditionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 7in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiondamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationvolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our businessfrom time to time we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedingsdisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our businesswe are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a number of factors including but not limited toenvironmental events strikes and other labor disputesdisruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites loss of key supplierssupplier capacity constraintsraw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issuesthe impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets and natural disasters including climatic events and earthquakes acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control 8in addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of timewhile we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionin addition as a result of our clustering of singlecountry subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting and customer service and logistics have become more concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiona cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputationwe rely extensively on information technology systems it systems including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited tocommunicating within the company and with other parties including our customers and consumersordering and managing materials from suppliersconverting materials to finished productsreceiving and processing orders from and shipping products to

informationcomplying with legal regulatory and tax requirementsproviding data security and handling other processes involved in managing our businessalthough we have network security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted we may suffer reputational competitive andor business harm incur significant costs and be subject to government investigations civil litigation fines andor damages which may adversely impact our business results of operations

reason including the poor performance of failure of or cyberattack on thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages cybersecurity breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of

matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sitesthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 175 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher

75 of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations in 2010 and 2013 and effective devaluations in 2014 and 2015 high inflation and a precipitous decline in the price of oil and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources increasingly the companys venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela has experienced various production interruptions due to material shortages caused by limited access to us dollars for imported materials delays in the importation process due to regulations and controls imposed by the venezuelan government labor unrest and high costs due to inflation coupled with the inability to increase prices without government approval price controls which became effective in april 2012 affect the majority of products in cp venezuelas portfolio and restrict the companys ability to implement price increases without government approval which has limited the companys ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in addition during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government issued the law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 for products and services cp venezuelas business is reliant on imported materials and products and it cannot maintain regular operations without sufficient access to us dollars which is controlled by the government in february 2015 the venezuelan government implemented changes in venezuelas foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce cencoex remained at 630 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market now known as sicad was unchanged the sicad ii market was eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system simadi was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants cp venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio have been designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported goods however cp venezuelas access to us dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015 although the simadi market has been accessible to cp venezuela it did not participate in that market through december 31 2015 since its inception the volume of transactions in the simadi market as a whole has been very limited and the simadi exchange rate at december 31 2015 was 19870 bolivares per dollar since the majority of cp venezuelas product portfolio is subject to price controls it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with us dollars obtained from the simadi marketthe companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions the restrictive exchange control regulations in venezuela and cp venezuelas increasingly limited access to us dollars have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this lack of exchangeability together with other government controls on pricing payments profits and imports and restrictive labor laws have significantly impacted the companys ability to make key operational decisions over its business in venezuela including the ability to manage its capital structure material sourcing product pricing and labor relations the company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future as a result effective december 31 2015 the company concluded it no longer meets the accounting criteria for consolidation of cp venezuela and began accounting for cp venezuela using the cost method of accounting as a result the company recorded an aftertax charge of 1058 1084 pretax or 116 per diluted share in 2015 the charge primarily consists of an impairment of the companys investment in cp venezuela of 952 which includes intercompany receivables from cp venezuela and 111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses 18dollars in millions except per share amountseffective december 31 2015 cp venezuelas net assets which include 75 and 394 of cash and government bonds respectively are no longer included in the companys consolidated balance sheet cp venezuelas net sales operating profit and net income through december 31 2015 are included in the companys consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2015 for the year ended

gain on the sale of the companys laundry detergent business in the south pacificin future periods under the cost method of accounting the company will no longer include the results of cp venezuela in its consolidated financial statements and will include income relating to its venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to cp venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by cp venezuela although cp venezuelas local operating results will no longer be included in the companys consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes under current tax rules the company is required to continue including cp venezuela in its consolidated us federal income tax return colgate has been operating in venezuela for 72 years and the company expects its operations in venezuela to continue to provide venezuelan consumers with the companys market leading brands prior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations which was effective

highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs driven by foreign exchange transaction costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the companys future resultsthe company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the companys strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the companys global brands its broad international presence in both mature and

currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market ratesthe companys foreign currency forward contracts that qualify for cash flow hedge

accounting pronouncementson january 5 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201601 financial instruments  overall subtopic 82510 recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities the updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments which includes amendments to address aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure the amendment to the standard is effective for the company beginning on june 1 2018 while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statementson november 20 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes under the new accounting standard deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2017 with early adoption permitted the standard may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented the company is currently assessing the timing of adoption of the new guidance but does not expect it will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statementson july 22 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test the guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than lastin firstout lifo and the retail inventory method the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2017 with early adoption permitted this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements  45dollars in millions except per share amountson april 7 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of related debt liability consistent with debt discounts under the former accounting standards such costs were recorded as an asset on august 18 2015 the fasb clarified that the guidance in asu no 201503 does not apply to lineofcredit arrangements accordingly companies may continue to present debt issuance costs for lineofcredit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement the new guidance in asu no 201503 was effective for the company beginning january 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statementson february 18 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis that amends the current consolidation guidance the amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models the new guidance was effective for the company beginning january 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements on may 28 2014 the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition the standard issued as asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers by the fasb provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards asu no 201409 was to be effective for the company beginning january 1 2017 however on july 9 2015 the fasb voted to approve a oneyear deferral of the effective date this new guidance is now expected to be effective for the company beginning january 1 2018 the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps from 586 to 509 in 2015 and decreased by 770 bps and 750 bps in 2014 and 2013 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 80 of inventories and the lifo method 20 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2015 2014 or 2013 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 46dollars in millions except per share amountsthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves and prior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuelain pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 493 424 and 496 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 497 436 and 524 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 680 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments and the historical rate of returnaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 1 7 6 6 and 8 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53 in fixed income securities 27 in equity securities and 20 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 10 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2015 december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plansthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 667 for 2016 declining to 475 by 2022 and remaining at 475 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 6the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2015 was 725 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6 47dollars in millions except per share amountsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performancethe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolutiontax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable incomelegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingenciesprior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in venezuela although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio have been designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported materials however the company did not believe this rate was applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends the company also gave consideration to using the simadi rate to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela however cp venezuela did not participate in the simadi market through december 31 2015 and had no intention to do so as a result the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel was the sicad raterefer to executive overview and outlook above and to note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys venezuelan operationsthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates

postclosure monitoring of several sites the company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 175 based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows

operations using the cost method of accounting and as a result its consolidated balance sheet no longer includes the assets and liabilities of cp venezuela as a result of this change in accounting the company recorded an aftertax charge of 1058 1084 pretax or 116 per diluted share in 2015 the charge primarily consists of an impairment of the companys investment in cp venezuela of 952 which includes intercompany receivables from cp venezuela and 111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses the restrictive exchange control regulations in venezuela and cp venezuelas increasingly limited access to us dollars have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this lack of exchangeability together with other government controls on pricing payments profits and imports and restrictive labor laws have significantly impacted the companys ability to make key operational decisions over cp venezuela including the ability to manage its capital structure material sourcing product pricing and labor relations the company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future as a result the company concluded that effective december 31 2015 it did not meet the accounting criteria for consolidation of cp venezuela and began accounting for cp venezuela using the cost method of accounting in future periods under the cost method of accounting the company will no longer include the results of cp venezuela in its consolidated financial statements and will include income relating to cp venezuela only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to cp venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by cp venezuela although cp venezuelas local operating results will no longer be included in the companys consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes under current tax rules the company is required to continue including cp venezuela in its consolidated us federal income tax returnin february 2015 the venezuelan government implemented changes in venezuelas foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce cencoex remained at 630 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market now known as sicad was unchanged the sicad ii market was eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system simadi was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants cp venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio have been designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported goods however cp venezuelas access to us dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015 although the simadi market has been accessible to cp venezuela it did not participate in that market through december 31 2015 since its inception the volume of transactions in the simadi market as a whole has been very limited and the exchange rate at december 31 2015 was 19870 bolivares per dollar since the majority of cp venezuelas product portfolio is subject to price controls it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with us dollars obtained from the simadi market 95colgatepalmolive company notes to consolidated financial statements dollars in millions except
