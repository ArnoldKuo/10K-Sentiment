adverse publicity about us our brands our supply chain or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumersadditionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal riskin addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiondamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other

antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment privacy environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and

assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall

to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit

other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwe also may periodically divest brands or businesses

such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sitesthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 225 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year 13brazilian mattersthere are certain tax and civil proceedings outstanding as described below related

above the funds from the sale were reinvested to expand the 2012 restructuring program 20dollars in millions except per share amountslooking forward the company expects global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging and category growth rates continuing to be slow while the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion in addition the emergence of new sales channels for the companys products such as ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics given that approximately 75 of the companys net sales originate in markets outside the us the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high raw and packaging material costs driven by foreign exchange transaction costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the companys future resultsthe company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the companys strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the companys global brands its broad international presence in both developed and emerging markets and initiatives such as the 2012 restructuring program should position the company well to increase shareholder value over the long term 21dollars in millions except per share

received a notice of an adverse decision in the foreign court regarding a tax position it has taken since 2002 as a result as required the company reassessed its tax position in light of the decision and concluded it needed to increase its unrecognized tax benefits by 30 and write off a 36 deferred tax asset in 2015 the company became aware of several supreme court rulings in the foreign jurisdiction disallowing certain tax deductions which had the effect of reversing prior decisions since the company had taken deductions in prior years similar to those now disallowed by the court the company as required reassessed its tax position and increased its unrecognized tax benefits by 15in 2016 the supreme court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the companys favor for the years 2002 through 2005 also in 2016 the administrative court in the foreign jurisdiction decided the matter in the companys favor for the years 2008 through 2011 by acknowledging the supreme courts ruling for the years 2002 through 2005 which eliminated the possibility of future appeals as a result the company recorded a tax benefit of 30 including interest the tax benefit of deductions related to this tax position taken for the years 2006 through 2007 and 2012 through 2014 totals approximately 14 at current exchange rates these deductions are currently being challenged by the tax

activities used 2233 of cash during 2016 compared to 2276 and 2170 during 2015 and 2014 respectively the decrease in cash used in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily due to lower purchases of treasury shares and higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and excess tax benefits partially offset by lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt the increase in cash used in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt higher dividends paid and higher purchases of treasury shares which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances

the companys foreign subsidiaries the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and as part of this assessment the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes on such earningsas of december 31 2016 the company had approximately 3400 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company considered such earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore not subject to such taxes in order to fully recognize a 210 us income tax benefit in 2016 principally related to changes in venezuelas foreign exchange regime during the quarter ended march 31 2016 the company decided to repatriate in 2016 1500 of earnings of foreign subsidiaries it previously considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and accordingly recorded a tax charge of 210 the company currently does not anticipate a need to repatriate additional undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries any future repatriation would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated  43dollars in millions except per share amountsthe

of income taxes on intraentity transfers until the asset is sold to an outside party the new guidance requires the recognition of current and deferred income taxes on intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory such as intellectual property and property plant and equipment when the transfer occurs the guidance is effective for the company on january 1 2018 and early adoption is permitted

of an award from grant date to the vesting or exercise date in the provision for income taxes as a discrete item in the quarterly period in which they occur currently excess tax benefits are recognized in equity in addition these amounts will be classified as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows instead of as a financing activity for the years 2014 to 2016 the company recognized excess tax benefits in equity in the range of 55 to 63 per year these amounts may not necessarily be indicative of future amounts that may be recognized subsequent to the adoption of this new standard as any excess tax benefits recognized would be dependent on future stock prices employee exercise behavior and applicable tax rates the new guidance was effective for the company

eliminates the requirement to retroactively adjust an investment that subsequently qualifies for equity method accounting as a result of an increase in level of ownership interest or degree of influence as if the equity method of accounting had been applied during all prior periods that the investment was held the new standard requires that the investor add the cost of acquiring additional ownership interest in the investee to its current basis and prospectively adopt the equity method of accounting any unrealized gains or losses in an availableforsale investment that subsequently qualifies as an equity method investment should be recognized in earnings at the date the investment qualifies as an equity method investment the new guidance was effective for the company beginning

recognition the standard issued as asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 by the fasb provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards this new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2018 during 2016 the fasb issued several accounting updates asu no 201608 201610 and 201612 to clarify implementation guidance and correct unintended application of the guidance

financial statements   47dollars in millions except per share amountscritical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 750 bps from 600 to 525 in 2016 and decreased by 770 bps in 2015 and 2014 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 75 of inventories and the lifo method 25 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2016 2015 or 2014 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo methodthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves and prior to the deconsolidation of the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuelain pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 427 493 and 424 as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 441 497 and 436 as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 680 as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments and the historical rate of returnaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 6 8 5 6 and 8 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53 in fixed income securities 27 in equity securities and 20 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 10 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plans 48dollars in millions except per share amountsthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 633 for 2017 declining to 475 by 2022 and remaining at 475 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 6the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2016 was 810 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method which requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate for the companys goodwill impairment analysis fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metrics of comparable publicly traded companies when multiple valuation methodologies are used the results are weighted appropriately qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performancethe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolutiontax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable incomelegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material effect on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingencies 49dollars in millions except per share amountsprior to the deconsolidation of the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in venezuela although access to us dollars in venezuela had been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio were designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported materials however the company believed this rate was not applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends the company also gave consideration to using the simadi rate to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela however cp venezuela did not participate in the simadi market through december 31 2015 and had no intention to do so as a result the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel was the sicad raterefer to executive overview and outlook above and to note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys venezuelan operationsthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of
