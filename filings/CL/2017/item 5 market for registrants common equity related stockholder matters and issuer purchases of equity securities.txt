summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of these risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 75 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import or export raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of volatile commodity prices including the price of oillack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operateforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions andor tariffs price controls labor laws travel or immigration restrictions profit controls or other government controlsthese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionin an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 4significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from strong local competitors and from other large multinational companies some of which may have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to enforce and defend our intellectual property including patent trademark copyright trade secret and trade dress rights against infringement and legal challenges by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully respond to them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroadnew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide and colgate total toothpaste in the us is subject to the fdas rigorous new drug application nda process for safety and efficacy in september 2016 the fda issued a final rule on ingredients permitted in antibacterial consumer soaps in the us which will restrict the use of 19 active ingredients including triclosan and triclocarban as of september 2017 the fda ruling will impact our antibacterial bar soap sold in puerto rico which contains triclocarban some states and municipalities in the us have proposed and minnesota has passed legislation banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan the minnesota legislation does not cover colgate total toothpaste in november 2016 environment and climate change canada eccc the federal environmental authority in canada finalized its review of the potential human and environmental risks of triclosan concluding that triclosan is not entering the environment in a quantity or concentration or under conditions that constitute or may constitute a danger in canada to human life or health and that triclosan is not bioaccumulative or persistent under canadian standards but that triclosan could be entering the environment at levels that could potentially cause harm to some aquatic organisms the canadian government will now work with stakeholders to ensure triclosan remains at safe levels for the environment and we will participate in this process triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european unions regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which evaluation process is expected to take multiple years to complete  5a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our businessbecause of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statementsincreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability the loss of a key customer or a significant reduction in sales to a key customer could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding our customers see distribution raw materials competition trademarks and patents in item 1 businesswe may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies or practices of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels for our products such as ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 6the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful launch of innovative new products and line extensions our ability to launch new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullyidentify develop and fund technological innovationsobtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could also be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertisingthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionif in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe a third partys intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring programin the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in 2014 and 2015 the 2012 restructuring program the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help us ensure sustained solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses while we are four years into the implementation of the 2012 restructuring program and many of the initiatives under the program have been successfully implemented or are nearing completion the successful implementation of the remainder of the program presents significant organizational challenges and in some cases may require successful negotiations with third parties as a result we may not be able to realize all of the remaining anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the remaining anticipated benefits or our not realizing such benefits on our expected timetable in addition changes in foreign exchange rates or in tax labor or immigration laws may result in our not achieving the remaining anticipated cost savings as measured in us dollars if we are unable to realize the remaining anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program

financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlookdamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands our supply chain or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability or policy issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumersadditionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal riskin addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiondamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationvolatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution  8legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our businessfrom time to time we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment privacy environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on certain of our legal claims and proceedingsdisruption in our global supply chain or key office facilities could adversely impact our businesswe are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale our operations and those of our suppliers could be disrupted by a

capacity constraintsraw material and product quality or safety issues industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issuesthe impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets and natural disasters including climatic events and earthquakes acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no controlin addition we purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from singlesource suppliers or a limited number of suppliers and new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of timewhile we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionin addition as a result of our clustering of singlecountry subsidiaries into regional commercial hubs and our implementation of a global shared service organizational model certain of our functions such as marketing finance and accounting and customer service and logistics have become more concentrated in key office facilities a significant disruption to any of our key office facilities for any reason including natural disasters acts of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 9a cybersecurity incident data breach or a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our business or reputationwe rely extensively on information technology systems it systems including some which are managed hosted provided andor used by third parties and their vendors in order to conduct our business our uses of these systems include but are not limited tocommunicating within the company and with other parties including our customers and consumersordering

requirementsproviding data security and handling other processes involved in managing our businessalthough we have a broad array of information security measures in place our it systems including those of thirdparty service providers with whom we have contracted have been and will likely continue to be subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes unauthorized access attempts phishing and other cyberattacks we cannot guarantee that our security efforts will prevent breaches or breakdowns of our or our thirdparty service providers it systems since the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time in addition although we have policies and procedures in place to ensure that all personal information collected by the company or its thirdparty service providers is securely maintained data breaches due to human error or intentional or unintentional conduct have occurred and likely will continue to occur although we have seen no material impact on our business operations from the cybersecurity attacks and data breaches we have experienced to date if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or

reputational harm and litigation which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition  10uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may reduce consumption or switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could negatively impact the availability or cost of funding reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior managementour success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we

be adversely affected while we follow a disciplined ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in timewe may pursue acquisitions and divestitures which could adversely impact our resultswe may

products of acquired brands or businesses the development or launch of products with acquired technologies the estimation of and assumption of liabilities and contingencies personnel turnover and the diversion of managements attention from other business priorities which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we may be unable to achieve any anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or at allmoreover our pursuit of acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation including for infringement of intellectual property or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwe also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses or otherwise achieve the anticipated
