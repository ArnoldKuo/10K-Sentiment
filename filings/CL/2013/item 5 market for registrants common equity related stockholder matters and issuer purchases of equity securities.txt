transactions in company stock by directors and officers and its proxy statementsitem 1a risk factorsset forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 80 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the companys exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our marketslack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where the company operatesforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions price controls or other government controls4these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements the company engages in a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operationsfor example in february 2013 the government of venezuela devalued its currency which will adversely affect our business and results of operations for 2013 likewise in 2010 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluations in venezuela in that year in addition on april 1 2012 price controls became effective in venezuela affecting most products in our venezuelan subsidiarys cp venezuela portfolio thereby further restricting the companys ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation in the fourth quarter of 2012 production at cp venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange or price controls or continued or increased labor unrest in venezuela could have further adverse impacts on our business and results of operations for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook and note 14 to the consolidated financial statementsuncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins for example continuing economic uncertainty in europe and a worsening of the debt crisis there could negatively affect consumer confidence globallywhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets including in europe could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our businesssignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities and new product introductions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability5increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels in addition the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results the growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullydevelop and fund technological innovationsobtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the us food and drug administration fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive positionwe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses the successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability6volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materialsdamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our businesssimilarly adverse publicity about the company or our brands regarding health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about the company on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationour business is subject to product liability claimsfrom time to time the company may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that its products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants for example the company has been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of the companys products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad us federal authorities including the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas7because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have a material adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statementsour business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activitiesthe company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited toindustrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issuesenvironmental events

or capital markets and natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no controlwhile we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business8a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the companys ability to conduct businessthe company relies extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited tocommunicating within the company and with other partiesordering and managing materials from

disruptions from unauthorized users while the company has business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not

businessour success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior managementour success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to

routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings these include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters management proactively reviews and monitors the companys exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sitesas a matter of course the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business in this regard all us federal income tax returns through december 31 2007 have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters in administrative appeals for years 2002 through 2007 the settlement of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition with a few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to 2007 in addition the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be materialthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 225 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year10brazilian mattersin 2001 the central bank of brazil sought to impose a substantial fine on the companys brazilian subsidiary based on alleged foreign exchange violations in connection with the financing of the companys 1995 acquisition of the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the companys form 8k dated january 10 1995 the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the companys favor dismissing the fine entirely however certain tax and civil proceedings that began as a result of this central bank matter are still outstanding as described belowthe brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the companys brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate 130 million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process with the following results to date in june 2005 the first board of taxpayers ruled in the companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1996 through 1998 in march 2007 the first board of taxpayers ruled in the companys favor and allowed all of the previously claimed deductions for 1999 through 2001 the tax authorities appealed these decisions to the next administrative levelin august 2009 the first taxpayers council the next and final administrative level of appeal overruled the decisions of the first board of taxpayers upholding the majority of the assessments disallowing a portion of the assessments and remanding a portion of the assessments for further consideration by the first board of taxpayers the company has filed a motion for clarification with a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers council and further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other advisors that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should ultimately prevail on appeal if necessary in the brazilian federal courts in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian subsidiary seeking to annul an april 2000 decision by the brazilian board of tax appeals that found in favor of the sellers brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had incurred taxable capital

current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions the company is disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authoritys administrative appeals process in october 2007 the second board of taxpayers which has jurisdiction over these matters ruled in favor of the internal revenue authority in january 2008 the company appealed this decision and in january 2012 a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers council denied the
