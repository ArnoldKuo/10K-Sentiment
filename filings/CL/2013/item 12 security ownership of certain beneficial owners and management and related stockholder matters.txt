transactions in company stock by directors and officers and its proxy statementsitem 1a risk factorsset forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could suffer which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 80 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce the companys exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our marketslack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where the company operatesforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions price controls or other government controls4these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements the company engages in a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operationsfor example in february 2013 the government of venezuela devalued its currency which will adversely affect our business and results of operations for 2013 likewise in 2010 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the designation of venezuela as hyperinflationary and the subsequent currency devaluations in venezuela in that year in addition on april 1 2012 price controls became effective in venezuela affecting most products in our venezuelan subsidiarys cp venezuela portfolio thereby further restricting the companys ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation in the fourth quarter of 2012 production at cp venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the country going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange or price controls or continued or increased labor unrest in venezuela could have further adverse impacts on our business and results of operations for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook and note 14 to the consolidated financial statementsuncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins for example continuing economic uncertainty in europe and a worsening of the debt crisis there could negatively affect consumer confidence globallywhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets including in europe could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our businesssignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities and new product introductions such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability5increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels in addition the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could adversely impact our financial results the growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullydevelop and fund technological innovationsobtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the us food and drug administration fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in the company not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive positionwe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help the company ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses the successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits from our 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all or any of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our profitability6volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins tropical oils essential oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take some period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materialsdamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our businesssimilarly adverse publicity about the company or our brands regarding health concerns our environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about the company on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationour business is subject to product liability claimsfrom time to time the company may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that its products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants for example the company has been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products it sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of the companys products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroad us federal authorities including the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency epa regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local level and comparable authorities overseas7because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide a finding by a regulatory authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could have a material adverse impact on our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise have a material adverse effect on our business while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 to the consolidated financial statementsour business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activitiesthe company is engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited toindustrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issuesenvironmental events

or capital markets and natural disasters acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no controlwhile we have business continuity and contingency plans for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business8a failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact the companys ability to conduct businessthe company relies extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct its business these systems include but are not limited tocommunicating within the company and with other partiesordering and managing materials from

businessour success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior managementour success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our future operations could be adversely affected in addition if we are unable to

company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sitesas a matter of course the company is regularly audited by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities around the world in countries where it conducts business in this regard all us federal income tax returns through december 31 2007 have been audited by the irs and there are limited matters in administrative appeals for years 2002 through 2007 the settlement of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition with a few exceptions the company is no longer subject to us state and local income tax examinations for the years prior to 2007 in addition the company has subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitations for tax audits generally ranging from three to six years incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be materialthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 225 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year10brazilian mattersin 2001 the central bank of brazil sought to impose a substantial fine on the companys brazilian subsidiary based on alleged foreign exchange violations in connection with the financing of the companys 1995 acquisition of the kolynos oral care business from wyeth formerly american home products the seller as described in the companys form 8k dated january 10 1995 the company appealed the imposition of the fine to the brazilian monetary system appeals council the council and on january 30 2007 the council decided the appeal in the companys favor dismissing the fine entirely however certain tax and civil proceedings that began as a result of this central bank matter are still outstanding as described belowthe brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the companys brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the kolynos acquisition the tax assessments with interest at the current exchange rate approximate 130 million the company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments within the internal revenue authoritys appellate process with the following results to date in june 2005 the first board of taxpayers ruled in

further consideration by the first board of taxpayers the company has filed a motion for clarification with a special appeals chamber of the taxpayers council and further appeals are available within the brazilian federal courts the company intends to challenge these assessments vigorously although there can be no assurances management believes based on the opinion of its brazilian legal counsel and other advisors that the disallowances are without merit and that the company should ultimately prevail on appeal if necessary in the brazilian federal courts in 2002 the brazilian federal public attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of brazil laboratorios wyethwhitehall ltda the brazilian subsidiary of the seller and the company as represented by its brazilian

current exchange rate based on a claim that certain purchases of us treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign

continues to prioritize its investments toward its higher margin businesses specifically oral care personal care and pet nutrition as disclosed in part i item 1a risk factors with approximately 80 of its net sales generated outside of the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political and economic uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price controls labor disruptions and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources15dollars in millions except per share amountsin particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 described in note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements on february 8 2013 the venezuelan government announced its intention to devalue its currency and effective on february 9 2013 the official exchange rate changed from 430 to 630 per dollar this devaluation had no impact on the companys 2012 consolidated financial statements the companys preliminary assessment of the onetime impact of the devaluation is that the company will incur an aftertax loss of approximately 120 025 per common share in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation there will also be ongoing impacts primarily related to the remeasurement of the local financial statements at the new exchange rate we will remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela for 2013 at 630 the rate at which we now expect to remit dividends while it is difficult to project it is the companys preliminary estimate that these ongoing impacts will reduce diluted earnings per common share by 005 to 007 per share per quarter in 2013 taking into account both the companys ability to take actions in venezuela and elsewhere to mitigate the effect of the devaluation and ongoing price control regulations in venezuela in addition the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls and price controls while cp venezuela continues to have limited access to us dollars from the government cadivi and currently only for imported goods the timing of receipt of these funds has slowed and become increasingly unpredictable cp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of us dollars obtained from cadivi intercompany borrowings and the use of financial and other intermediaries and to a lesser extent with existing us dollar cash balances which were obtained previously through parallel market transactions and through the prior liquidation of its us dollardenominated bond portfolio on april 1 2012 additional price controls became effective affecting most products in cp venezuelas portfolio thereby further restricting the companys ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation in the fourth quarter of 2012 production at cp venezuela was negatively impacted by labor issues within the countrythe companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest following the february 2013 devaluation cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation was reduced to approximately 390 as compared to approximately 520 at december 31 2012 and it is expected that cp venezuela will represent less than 4 of the companys consolidated net sales in 2013 the company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to venezuelain the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the programs initiatives are expected to help colgate ensure continued solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance its global leadership positions in its core businesses implementation of the 2012 restructuring program which is expected to be substantially completed by december 31 2016 is projected to result in cumulative pretax charges once all phases are approved and implemented totaling between 1100 and 1250 775 and 875 aftertax savings are projected to be in the range of 365 to 435 pretax 275 to 325 aftertax annually by the fourth year of the program substantially all of which are expected to increase future cash flows for more information regarding the 2012 restructuring program see restructuring and related implementation charges below in 2012 the company incurred

accordance with a business and share sale and purchase agreement for an aggregate purchase price of 676 966 the acquisition was financed with available cash proceeds from the sale of the companys eurodenominated investment portfolio and the issuance of commercial paperlooking forward we expect global macroeconomic and market conditions to remain highly challenging while the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally we continue to experience foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the companys future resultsthe company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the companys strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus

2012 and 2011 respectively these amounts include 170 and 385 at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively which are subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and as part of this assessment determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes on such earningsas of december 31 2012 the company had approximately 4300 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes determining the tax liability

normal course of business these purchase obligation amounts represent only those items which are based on agreements that are legally binding and that specify minimum quantity price and term and do not represent total anticipated purchaseslongterm liabilities associated with the companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding related to these benefit plans will generally depend on local regulatory requirements various economic assumptions the most significant of which are detailed in critical accounting policies and use of estimates below and voluntary company contributions based on current information the company is not required to make a mandatory contribution to its qualified us pension plan in 2013 managements best estimate of voluntary contributions to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2013 is approximately 100 in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december 31 2013 from the companys assets is estimated to be approximately 94additionally liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are excluded from the table above as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of a settlement of such liabilities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for

products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the results of operations section above for discussion of the foreign exchange impact on net sales in each

company is exposed to the risk of credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts however nonperformance is considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the companys policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations recent accounting pronouncementsin february 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu no 201302 requires presentation of reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements for those amounts required to be reclassified into net income in their entirety in the same reporting period for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period crossreference to other disclosures is required as permitted under asu 201302 the company has elected to present reclassification adjustments from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income within a single note to the financial statements beginning the in first quarter of 2013 in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 eliminates the current option to disclose other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity as permitted under asu no 201105 the company has elected to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in two separate consecutive statements beginning in the first quarter of 2012 critical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the companys financial condition and results of operations and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 740 bps from 581 to 507 in 2012 and decreased by 750 bps and 730 bps in 2011 and 2010 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 80 of inventories and the lastin firstout lifo method 20 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2012 2011 and 2010 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo methodthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other postretirement benefits stock options asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingenciesin pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 414 490 and 530 as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 432 526 and 530 as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively discount rates used for the us defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the 34dollars in millions except per share amountsestimated payouts of the us plans for the companys international plans the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investmentgrade corporate bonds rated aa the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 730 as of december 31 2012 775 as of december 31 2011 and 800 as of december 31 2010 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments the expectation for the plans investment strategies and the historical rate of returnaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 13 4 8 6 and 8 respectively in addition the current rate of return assumption for the us plans is based upon a targeted asset allocation of approximately 40 in fixed income securities 52 in equity securities and 8 in real estate and alternative investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 2 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 7 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2012 and 400 as of december 31 2011 and 2010 refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plansthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase is 75 for 2013 declining to 50 by 2018 and remaining at 50 for the years thereafter the effect of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 6the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stockoption awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended december 31 2012 was 1346 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options these assumptions include the expected term of options expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value a oneyear change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7 a one percent change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performancethe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value except for the intangible assets acquired in the recent sanex acquisition which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolutiontax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable income35dollars in millions except per share amountslegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingenciesthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates refer to note
