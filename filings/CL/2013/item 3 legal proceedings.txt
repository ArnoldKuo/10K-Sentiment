from three to six years incremental tax payments related to potential disallowances for subsequent periods are not expected to be materialthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 225 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year10brazilian
