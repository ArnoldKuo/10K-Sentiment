have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives adverse publicity about us our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media website whether true or untrue could harm our reputation the success of our brands could also suffer if our marketing initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brands image or its ability to attract consumersadditionally due to the scale and scope of our business we must rely on relationships with third parties including our suppliers distributors contractors joint venture partners and other external business partners for certain functions while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations governance and compliance thereby potentially increasing our reputational and legal risk 7in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiondamage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely

profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along such higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution legal claims and proceedings could adversely impact our businessfrom time to time we may be subject to legal claims and proceedings including disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend since litigation is inherently uncertain there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters including any reserves taken in connection therewith will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a legal claim or proceeding is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image see item 3 legal

can require additional investment and take a significant period of timewhile we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate and have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw and packaging materials significant disruption of manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionin addition as a result of our

affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate foreign currency or commodity price exposures

performance of our management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key people our business results of operations

operations cash flows and financial condition in addition we may be unable to achieve any anticipated benefits or cost savings from acquisitions in the time frame we anticipate or at allmoreover our pursuit of acquisitions could result in substantial additional debt exposure to contingent liabilities such as litigation including for infringement of intellectual property or earnout obligations the potential impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets or transaction costs all of which may adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwe also may periodically divest brands or businesses these divestitures may adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the

include disputes relating to intellectual property contracts product liability marketing advertising foreign exchange controls antitrust and trade regulation as well as labor and employment environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions management proactively reviews and monitors the companys exposure to and the impact of environmental matters the company is party to various environmental matters and as such may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup restoration and postclosure monitoring of several sitesthe company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 175 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year 12brazilian mattersthere are certain tax and civil proceedings

care personal care and pet nutrition  17dollars in millions except per share amountsas discussed in part i item 1a risk factors with approximately 75 of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations in 2010 and 2013 and effective devaluations in 2014 and 2015 high inflation and a precipitous decline in the price of oil and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources increasingly the companys venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela has experienced various production interruptions due to material shortages caused by limited access to us dollars for imported materials delays in the importation process due to regulations and controls imposed by the venezuelan government labor unrest and high costs due to inflation coupled with the inability to increase prices without government approval price controls which became effective in april 2012 affect the majority of products in cp venezuelas portfolio and restrict the companys ability to implement price increases without government approval which has limited the companys ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in addition during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government issued the law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 for products and services cp venezuelas business is reliant on imported materials and products and it cannot maintain regular operations without sufficient access to us dollars which is controlled by the government in february 2015 the venezuelan government implemented changes in venezuelas foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce cencoex remained at 630 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market now known as sicad was unchanged the sicad ii market was eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system simadi was created and became operational with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants cp venezuela has funded its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio have been designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported goods however cp venezuelas access to us dollars to fund imports became increasingly more limited and sporadic in 2015 and deteriorated even further during the fourth quarter of 2015 although the simadi market has been accessible to cp venezuela it did not participate in that market through december 31 2015 since its inception the volume of transactions in the simadi market as a whole has been very limited and the simadi exchange rate at december 31 2015 was 19870 bolivares per dollar since the majority of cp venezuelas product portfolio is subject to price controls it could not operate profitably without substantial price increases approved by the government if it had to pay for imported materials with us dollars obtained from the simadi marketthe companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions the restrictive exchange control regulations in venezuela and cp venezuelas increasingly limited access to us dollars have resulted in an otherthantemporary lack of exchangeability between the venezuelan bolivar and the us dollar this lack of exchangeability together with other government controls on pricing payments profits and imports and restrictive labor laws have significantly impacted the companys ability to make key operational decisions over its business in venezuela including the ability to manage its capital structure material sourcing product pricing and labor relations the company expects these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future as a result effective december 31 2015 the company concluded it no longer meets the accounting criteria for consolidation of cp venezuela and began accounting for cp venezuela using the cost method of accounting as a result the company recorded an aftertax charge of 1058 1084 pretax or 116 per diluted share in 2015 the charge primarily consists of an impairment of the companys investment in cp venezuela of 952 which includes intercompany receivables from cp venezuela and 111 related to the reclassification of cumulative translation losses 18dollars in millions except per share amountseffective december 31 2015 cp venezuelas net assets which include 75 and 394 of cash and government bonds respectively are no longer included in the companys consolidated balance sheet cp venezuelas net sales operating profit and net income through december 31 2015 are included in the companys consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2015 for the year ended december 31 2015 cp venezuela represented approximately 4 of the companys consolidated net sales and approximately 2 of the companys consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of charges related to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations the 2015 venezuela remeasurements as defined below a foreign competition law matter and the 2012 restructuring program and a gain on the sale of the companys laundry detergent business in the south pacificin future periods under the cost method of accounting the company will no longer include the results of cp venezuela in its consolidated financial statements and will include income relating to its venezuelan operations only to the extent it receives cash for sales of inventory to cp venezuela or for dividends or royalties remitted by cp venezuela although cp venezuelas local operating results will no longer be included in the companys consolidated financial statements for accounting purposes under current tax rules the company is required to continue including cp venezuela in its consolidated us federal income tax return colgate has been operating in venezuela for 72 years and the company expects its operations in venezuela to continue to provide venezuelan consumers with the companys market leading brands prior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations which was effective december 31 2015 the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expected to remit future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel was the sicad rate during the year ended december 31 2015 the company incurred pretax losses of 34 22 aftertax or 002 per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the quarterend sicad

note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations effective december 31 2015 the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and as part of this assessment the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes on such earningsas of december 31 2015 the company had approximately 4600 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated the following represents the scheduled maturities of the companys

does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statementson november 20 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes under the new accounting standard deferred tax assets and liabilities are required to be classified as noncurrent eliminating the prior requirement to separate deferred tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2017 with early adoption permitted the standard may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented the company is currently assessing the timing of adoption of the new guidance but does not expect it will have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statementson july 22 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201511 inventory topic 330 simplifying the measurement of inventory which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by replacing the lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test the guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than lastin firstout lifo and the retail inventory method the new guidance is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2017 with early adoption

asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of related debt liability consistent with debt discounts under the former accounting standards such costs were recorded as an asset on august 18 2015 the fasb clarified that the guidance in asu no 201503 does not apply to lineofcredit arrangements accordingly companies may continue to present debt issuance costs for lineofcredit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize the deferred debt costs ratably over the term of the arrangement the new guidance in asu no 201503 was effective for the company beginning january 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statementson february 18 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201502 consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis that amends the current consolidation guidance the amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models the new guidance was effective for the company beginning january 1 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements on may 28 2014 the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition the standard issued as asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers by the fasb provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards asu no 201409 was to be effective for the company beginning january 1 2017 however on july 9 2015 the fasb voted to approve a oneyear deferral of the effective date this new guidance is now expected to be effective for the company beginning january 1 2018 the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps from 586 to 509 in 2015 and decreased by 770 bps and 750 bps in 2014 and 2013 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 80 of inventories and the lifo method 20 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2015 2014 or 2013 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 46dollars in millions except per share amountsthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances legal and other contingency reserves and prior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuelain pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 493 424 and 496 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 497 436 and 524 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 680 as of december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments and the historical rate of returnaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 1 7 6 6 and 8 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53 in fixed income securities 27 in equity securities and 20 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 10 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2015 december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plansthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 667 for 2016 declining to 475 by 2022 and remaining at 475 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 6the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2015 was 725 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in expected term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 7 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6 47dollars in millions except per share amountsgoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performancethe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolutiontax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable incomelegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingenciesprior to the change in accounting for the companys venezuelan operations the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanisms that exist in venezuela although access to us dollars in venezuela has been challenging because the majority of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio have been designated as essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuelas access to us dollars at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar was generally sufficient to settle most of its us dollar obligations for imported materials however the company did not believe this rate was applicable to foreign investments and could not be used to pay dividends the company also gave consideration to using the simadi rate to remeasure the financial statements of cp venezuela however cp venezuela did not participate in the simadi market through december 31 2015 and had no intention to do so as a result the company remeasured the financial statements of cp venezuela at the rate at which it believed was applicable for the remittance of future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel was the sicad raterefer to executive overview and outlook above and to note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys venezuelan operationsthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and cash receipt thereby reducing the level of uncertainty in these estimates
