the exchange act of transactions in company stock by directors and officers and its proxy statementsitem 1a risk factorsset forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 80 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets including as a result of volatile commodity prices including the price of oillack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operateforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions price controls labor laws profit controls or other government controlsthese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionin an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of selling price increases where permitted sourcing strategies costcontainment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations 4for example the companys ability to manage its venezuelan operations has been and will continue to be negatively impacted by difficult conditions in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the effective devaluations that occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multitier foreign exchange system in 2014 since april 2012 when price controls affecting most of our venezuelan subsidiarys cp venezuela product portfolio became effective we have not been able to implement price increases without government approval which has limited our ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in addition labor laws limit our ability to manage overhead costs and at times production at cp venezuela has been negatively impacted by local labor issues going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or effective devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government takeover could have further adverse impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as could economic instability resulting from the decline in the price of oil for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook and note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statementssignificant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroadnew or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste and certain other oral care products is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european unions regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals reach which requires the registration of all covered chemicals used in the european union by 2018 in the us the fda is evaluating the use of benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products and triclosan in hand soaps and hand sanitizers in 2014 a law banning the sale of certain products containing triclosan was passed in minnesota but the law does not cover colgate total toothpaste similar legislation has been proposed in iowa new york and michigan while legislation seeking to ban the sale of all consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed in chicago illinois environment canada the federal environmental authority in canada is also conducting a review to assess human and environmental risks of triclosan and is expected to issue its final assessment in march 2015 depending on the findings in the final assessment it is possible that environment canada will issue voluntary or mandatory risk management measures for triclosan a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business  5because of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our reputation and our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwhile it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statementsuncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities a disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit recent and proposed changes in the bank regulatory environment could reduce the ability of financial institutions to extend credit or increase the cost we are charged to receive credit reduced access to credit or increased costs could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital in addition if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facilities supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionincreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitabilitywe may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 6the growth of our business depends on the successful identification development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful identification development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the identification development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullyidentify develop and fund technological innovationsobtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionif in the course of identifying or developing new products we are found to have infringed the trademark trade secret copyright patent or other intellectual property rights of others directly or indirectly through the use of thirdparty ideas or technologies such a finding could adversely affect our ability to develop innovative new products and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if we are not found to infringe on a third partys intellectual property rights claims of infringement could adversely affect us including by increasing costs and by delaying the launch of new products we may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring programin the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program for sustained growth which was expanded in the fourth quarter of 2014 to take advantage of additional savings opportunities as expanded the 2012 restructuring program the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses the successful implementation of the remainder of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases requires successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to continue to realize the anticipated benefits from the 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for additional information regarding the 2012 restructuring program refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook and  restructuring and related implementation charges 7volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils tallow poultry corn and soybeans are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain key materials including the triclosan used in colgate total toothpaste we use singlesource suppliers in addition for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints climatic events such as droughts or hurricanes and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiondamage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionsimilarly adverse publicity about us our brands or our ingredients regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for these or any other reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationour business is subject to product liability false advertising and consumer fraud claimsfrom time to time we may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that our products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants in addition from time to time we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers including consumer class actions alleging that our product claims are deceptive or that our ingredient or content labeling is defective regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend for example as described in item 3 legal proceedings we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability false advertising or consumer fraud claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image 8there is no guarantee that our ongoing efforts to reduce costs will be successfulwe develop investments needed to support growth through our continuous companywide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization which we refer to as our fundingthegrowth initiatives these initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials indirect expenses and distribution and logistics the achievement of our fundingthegrowth targets depends on our ability to successfully identify and realize additional savings opportunities events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of our fundingthegrowth initiatives our ability to fund other initiatives and enhance profitability may be adversely affected any failure to implement our fundingthegrowth initiatives in

the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations high inflation and the decline in the price of oil and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resources price controls which became effective in april 2012 affect most products in the portfolio of the companys venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela and restrict the companys ability to implement price increases without government approval which has limited the companys ability to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluations in particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the effective devaluations that have occurred in 2014 as a result of the introduction of a multitier foreign exchange system implemented during the first quarter of 2014 in addition the decline in the price of oil may result in a reduced availability of us dollars to fund cp venezuelas importsduring the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government enacted several changes to venezuelas foreign exchange regime introducing a multitier foreign exchange system creating three exchange rate mechanisms available to convert venezuelan bolivares to us dollars although the official exchange rate as determined by the national center for foreign commerce cencoex remained at 630 bolivares per dollar the exchange rate for foreign investments moved to the rate available on the sicad i supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency currency market the venezuelan government also introduced an alternative currency market known as sicad ii the company remeasures the financial statements of cp venezuela at the end of each month at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends which based on the advice of legal counsel is the sicad i rate during the year ended december 31 2014 the company incurred net pretax losses of 327 214 aftertax losses or 023 per diluted common share related to the remeasurement of cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary assets at the quarterend sicad i rate for each of the first three quarters of 2014 the sicad i rate did not revalue during the fourth quarter of 2014 and remained at 1200 bolivares per dollar as of december 31 2014 included in the net remeasurement losses during 2014 were charges related to the devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela because the official exchange rate remained at 630 bolivares per dollar the devaluationprotected bonds did not revalue at the rate available on the sicad i currency market but remained at the official exchange rate which resulted in an impairment in the fair value of the bonds the net remeasurement losses incurred in 2014 are referred to as the 2014 venezuela remeasurementsthere continue to be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and to a lesser degree the import of materials at the sicad i exchange rate as some imports may still qualify for the official rate because the sicad i market is auctionbased and auctions are held periodically during each quarter the exchange rate available through sicad i may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuelas ongoing resultscp venezuela continues to be able to settle certain of its us dollar obligations for imported materials at the official rate of 630 bolivares per dollar and records the gains related to such transactions when the funds are authorized by cencoex and the liabilities are paid as part of the announcements during the first quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 the new law does not apply to products that are subject to price controls which includes most of the products in cp venezuelas portfolio during the third quarter of 2014 the venezuelan government approved price increases for the majority of cp

venezuela remeasurementscp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods through a combination of us dollars obtained from cencoex and intercompany borrowings cp venezuelas supply of us dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic cp venezuela was invited to participate in the sicad i currency market during the second and fourth quarters of 2014 and received less than 1 in each of those quarters at a rate of 1050 bolivares per dollar and 1200 bolivares per dollar respectively although accessible to the company the company did not participate in the sicad ii currency market during 2014 cp venezuelas difficulty in accessing us dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business additionally at times production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the countryfor the year ended december 31 2014 cp venezuela represented approximately 3 of the companys consolidated net sales and approximately 1 of the companys consolidated operating profit excluding the impacts of the 2014 venezuela remeasurements charges related to the 2012 restructuring program and certain european

continued high inflation or further devaluations or if it does not have sufficient access to us dollars to fund imports in february 2015 the venezuelan government announced changes in venezuelas foreign exchange regime while the official exchange rate as determined by cencoex remains at 630 bolivares per dollar and the sicad i market now known as sicad is unchanged and the rate currently remains at 1200 bolivares per dollar the sicad ii market discussed above has been eliminated and a new alternative currency market the foreign exchange marginal system simadi has been created with a floating exchange rate determined by market participants the simadi market became operational with an initial exchange rate of 17004 bolivares per dollar while the company will continue to assess the impact if any of these changes as the government of venezuela issues regulations to implement them if cp venezuela is unable to obtain sufficient us dollars from cencoex or the sicad market to fund its requirements for imported goods and instead needs to access the simadi market it could significantly impact the companys operations in venezuela the company continues to actively manage its investment in and limit its exposure to venezuela the companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by the difficult conditions described above additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing payments profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest would further negatively affect the companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to effectively make key operational decisions in regard to its venezuelan operations both of which could result in an impairment of the companys investment in cp venezuela at december 31 2014 the companys total investment in cp venezuela was 955 which included

access to global credit and capital marketscash flownet cash provided by operations was 3298 in 2014 compared to 3204 in 2013 and 3196 in 2012 net cash provided by operations for 2014 increased due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital the increase in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 restructuring program the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities the latter of which is reported in other current assets and current liabilities excluding shortterm debt the companys working capital as a percentage of net sales

respectively purchases of marketable securities and investments decreased in 2014 to 340 from 505 in 2013 partially due to a decrease in purchases of investments by the companys subsidiary in

mexican subsidiary entered into an agreement to sell the mexico city site on which its commercial operations technology center and soap production facility were located during 2011 and 2012 the

transfer of the property is likely to occur in 2015 capital expenditures were 757 670 and 565 for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns capital expenditures for 2015 are expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 45 of net sales which is higher than the historical rate of

used in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to higher principal payments on debt and higher dividends paid which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuances of debt the decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options 39dollars

2013 respectively which are subject to currency exchange controls in venezuela limiting the total amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries that can be repatriated at any particular point in time the company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs and as part of this assessment the company determines the amount of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes on such earningsas of december 31 2014 the company had approximately 4900 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes as the company operates in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world and due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made it is not practicable to determine the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated the following

liabilities associated with the companys postretirement plans are excluded from the table above due to the uncertainty of the timing of these cash disbursements the amount and timing of cash funding

does not expect to make a voluntary contribution to the us pension plans for the year ending december 31 2015 in addition total benefit payments to be paid to participants for the year ending december

international accounting standards board iasb issued their final converged standard on revenue recognition the standard issued as accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers by the fasb provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition guidance the revenue standard contains principles that an entity will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the new standard also includes enhanced disclosures which are significantly more comprehensive than those in existing revenue standards this new guidance is effective for the company beginning january 1 2017 with no early adoption permitted the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented or modified retrospective adoption meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements while the company is currently assessing the impact of the new standard it does not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 43dollars in millions except per share amounts on april 10 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity asu no 201408 changes the criteria for reporting discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements the new guidance is effective for the company on a prospective basis beginning january 1 2015 this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 770 bps from 585 to 508 in 2014 and decreased by 750 bps and 740 bps in 2013 and 2012 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 80 of inventories and the lastin firstout lifo method 20 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2014 2013 or 2012 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo methodthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reservesin pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 424 496 and 414 as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 436 524 and 432 as of december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds whose projected cash flows approximate the projected benefit payments of the plans the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 680 as of december 31 2014 680 as of december 31 2013 and 730 as of december 31 2012 as the funded status of the us postretirement plans improved in 2013 the company reallocated a portion of the assets of those plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments and the historical rate of return 44dollars in millions except per share amountsaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 11 10 7 5 and 8 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53 in fixed income securities 27 in equity securities and 20 in real estate and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 11 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 4 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2014 december 31 2013 and december 31 2012 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plansthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 70 for 2015 declining to 50 by 2021 and remaining at 50 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 7the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december 31 2014 was 760 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of stock option awards these assumptions include the expected term of stock option awards expected volatility rate riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in the fair value of stock option awards a oneyear change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 7goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performancethe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the companys subsidiary in venezuela requires managements best estimate of future exchange rates between

considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable incomelegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingenciesthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less
