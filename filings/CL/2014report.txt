corporate governance guidelines the charters of the committees of the board reports under section 16 of the exchange act of transactions in company stock by directors and officers and its proxy statementsitem 1a risk factorsset forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities these risks are not the only ones we face additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us if any of the below risks actually occur our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted which might cause the value of our securities to declinewe face risks associated with significant international operations including exposure to foreign currency fluctuationswe operate on a global basis with approximately 80 of our net sales originating in markets outside the us while geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations including but not limited tochanges in exchange rates for foreign currencies which may reduce the us dollar value of revenues profits and cash flows we receive from nonus markets or increase our supply costs as measured in us dollars in those marketsexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseaspolitical or economic instability social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our marketslack of wellestablished or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operateforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources andother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions price controls profit controls or other government controlsthese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements we engage in a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions however these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operationsfor example we have been and will continue to be impacted by developments in venezuela including the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 and the announcements made in late january 2014 on april 1 2012 price controls became effective in venezuela affecting most products in our venezuelan subsidiarys cp venezuela portfolio thereby further restricting our ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluation in addition at  4times production at cp venezuela has been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country going forward additional government actions including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls foreign exchange price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government takeover could have further adverse impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as could additional labor unrest in venezuela for additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in venezuela refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  executive overview and outlook and note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our businesswe face vigorous competition worldwide including from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than we do we face this competition in several aspects of our business including but not limited to the pricing of products promotional activities new product introductions and expansion into new geographies such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitorswe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them which could harm our business in addition the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges including management time outofpocket expenses and price reductions may affect our performance in the relevant period a failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionour business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the us and abroadour business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the us and abroad such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products including their development ingredients manufacture packaging labeling storage transportation distribution export import advertising and sale us federal authorities including the us food and drug administration the fda the federal trade commission the consumer product safety commission and the environmental protection agency regulate different aspects of our business along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas also our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the us and abroadbecause of our extensive international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws the fcpa and similar worldwide antibribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees jointventure partners or agents violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition for example from time to time various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in europe the us and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products triclosan an ingredient used by us primarily in colgate total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide triclosan is currently being evaluated under the european unions regulation for the registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemicals which requires the registration of all chemicals used in the european union by 2018 in the us the fda is evaluating the use of triclosan and benzalkoniam chloride an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products in hand soaps and hand sanitizers in addition potential legislation seeking to ban the sale of consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed by legislators in chicago illinois and in minnesota a decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan or any other of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated could adversely impact our business as could negative reactions by our consumers trade customers or nongovernmental organizations to our use of such ingredients additionally an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business  5while it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business a finding that we are in violation of or out of compliance with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies including fines damages injunctions or product recalls or criminal sanctions any of which could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition even if a claim is unsuccessful is without merit or is not fully pursued the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image for information regarding our legal and regulatory matters see item 3 legal proceedings and note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statementsuncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our businessuncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues profitability and cash flows although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings additionally retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lowerpriced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and marginswhile we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital if any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us this could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures in addition tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers contract manufacturers or trade customers which could in turn adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionincreasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our businessour products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of largeformat retailers and discounters with the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation we are increasingly dependent on key retailers and some of these retailers including largeformat retailers may have greater bargaining strength than we do they may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts allowances or slotting fees which could lead to reduced sales or profitability we may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers such as inventory destocking limitations on access to shelf space delisting of our products environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions for example a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly restricted could adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition in addition private label products sold by retail trade chains which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products are a source of competition for certain of our product lines including liquid hand soaps and shower gels the emergence of new sales channels such as sales via ecommerce may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition the growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new productsour growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions the development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch such as increased promotional activities and advertising in addition our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfullydevelop and fund technological innovations 6obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of othersobtain approvals and registrations of regulated products including from the fda and other regulatory bodies in the us and abroad andanticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferencesthe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionwe may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2012 we commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the 2012 restructuring programs initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses the successful implementation of the 2012 restructuring program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties including labor organizations suppliers and other business partners as a result we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our 2012 restructuring program events and circumstances such as financial or strategic difficulties delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable if we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 restructuring program our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected any failure to implement the 2012 restructuring program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionvolatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitabilityraw and packaging material commodities such as resins pulp essential oils tropical oils poultry corn soybeans and tallow are subject to wide price variations increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution in addition our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers for certain key materials including triclosan we use singlesource suppliers in addition for certain materials new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry governmental and colgate standards which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time while we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate global economic conditions supplier capacity constraints climatic events such as droughts or hurricanes and other factors could affect the availability of or prices for those raw materials and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business results of operation cash flows and financial condition damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our businessmaintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products accordingly we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation such as our ethics and compliance sustainability brand protection and product safety regulatory and quality initiatives in addition third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products which are inferior or may pose safety risks as a result consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditionsimilarly adverse publicity about us or our brands regarding health concerns legal or regulatory proceedings environmental impacts including packaging energy and water use and waste management or other sustainability issues whether or not deserved could jeopardize our reputation in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these  7reasons could adversely affect our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition as well as require resources to rebuild our reputationour business is subject to product liability and false marketing claimsfrom time to time we may be subject to product liability claims alleging among other things that our products cause damage to property or persons provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants in addition from time to time we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers including consumer class actions alleging that our product claims are deceptive regardless of their merit these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend for example as described in item 3 legal proceedings we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos causing harm to consumers in addition if one of our products or a raw material contained in our products is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe we may need to recall some of our products whether or not a product liability or false marketing claim is successful or a recall is required such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand imageour business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activitieswe are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities including but not limited toindustrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issuesenvironmental events strikes and other labor disputesdisruptions in logistics loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites raw material and product quality or safety issues the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets and natural disasters including climatic events and earthquakes acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no controlwhile we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and if not remedied have an adverse impact on our business results of operations cash flows and financial conditiona failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct businesswe rely extensively on information technology systems including some which rely on thirdparty service providers in order to conduct our business these systems include but are not limited tocommunicating within the company and with other

breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users while we have business continuity plans in place if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason including the poor performance or failure of thirdparty service providers catastrophic events power outages security breaches network outages failed upgrades or other similar events and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm which may adversely impact our

establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstancesthe company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities if any when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates for those matters disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 250 million based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate amount may not represent the ultimate loss to the company from the matters in question thus the companys exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed abovebased on current knowledge management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the companys consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows however in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the companys results of operations or cash flows for any

oral care personal care and pet nutrition  15dollars in millions except per share amountsas disclosed in part i item 1a risk factors with approximately 80 of its net sales generated outside the united states the company is exposed to changes in economic conditions and foreign currency exchange rates as well as political uncertainty in some countries all of which could impact future operating results for example as discussed in detail below the operating environment in venezuela is challenging with economic uncertainty fueled by currency devaluations and high inflation and governmental restrictions in the form of import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls price and profit controls and the possibility of expropriation of property or other resourcesin particular the company has been and will continue to be impacted as a result of the significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in february 2013 described in note 14 venezuela to the consolidated financial statements effective february 9 2013 the venezuelan government devalued its currency and the official exchange rate changed from 430 to 630 venezuelan bolivares fuerte per dollar the company incurred a onetime pretax loss of 172 111 aftertax loss in the first quarter of 2013 related to the remeasurement of the net monetary assets in the local balance sheet at the date of the devaluation the company remeasures the financial statements of its venezuelan subsidiary cp venezuela at the rate at which it expects to remit future dividends at december 31 2013 that rate was 630 as the local currency operations in venezuela translated into fewer us dollars the february 2013 devaluation had and will continue to have an ongoing adverse effect on the companys reported results in addition the venezuelan government continues to impose import authorization controls currency exchange and payment controls and price controls price controls which became effective on april 1 2012 affect most products in cp venezuelas portfolio and thereby further restrict the companys ability to implement price increases which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluationscp venezuela funds its requirements for imported goods primarily through a combination of us dollars obtained from cadivi and intercompany borrowings the amount of us dollars received from cadivi in 2013 was higher than the amount received in 2012 however cp venezuelas supply of us dollars to fund imports has been limited and sporadic in the second quarter of 2013 the venezuelan government introduced a new currency market known as sicad supplementary system for the administration of foreign currency which is an auction market in which only companies invited by the venezuelan government can participate the sicad currency market is expected to be accessible to the company however the company was not able to participate in the auctions held through december 31 2013 cp venezuelas difficulty in accessing us dollars to support its operations has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on the business additionally at times production at cp venezuela has also been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country at december 31 2013 cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary asset position which would be subject to remeasurement in the event of a further devaluation was approximately 600 this amount does not include 233 of devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government as these bonds provide protection against devaluations by adjusting the amount of bolivares fuerte received at maturity for any devaluation subsequent to issuance cp venezuelas local currencydenominated nonmonetary assets were approximately 335 at december 31 2013 and included approximately 225 of fixed assets that could be subject to impairment if cp venezuela continues to be unable to implement price increases to offset the impacts of continued high inflation or further devaluations or if it does not have sufficient access to us dollars to fund imports for the year ended december 31 2013 cp venezuela represented approximately 4 of the companys consolidated net sales and approximately 3 of the companys consolidated operating profit excluding the impact of the onetime venezuela devaluation charge and charges related to the 2012 restructuring program discussed below the competition law matter in france related to the home care and personal care sectors and costs related to the sale of land in mexico discussed below in late january 2014 the venezuelan government made several announcements affecting currency exchange and other controls although the official exchange rate remains at 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar the government announced that the exchange rate for foreign investments will move to the rate available on the sicad currency market which in the last auction was 1170 bolivares fuerte per dollar while there is considerable uncertainty as to the nature of transactions that will flow through sicad and how sicad will operate in the future effective with the quarter ending march 31 2014 the company expects that the majority of cp venezuelas net monetary assets will be remeasured at the sicad rate since that is the rate the company now believes based on the advice of legal counsel will be applicable for future dividend remittances in addition because the official exchange rate remains at 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar the company currently expects that the 233 million of devaluationprotected bonds issued by the venezuelan government and held by cp venezuela will not revalue at the rate available on the sicad currency market but will remain at the official rate if the sicad rate were to remain at 1170  16dollars in millions except per share amountsduring the quarter ending march 31 2014 the company estimates it would incur a onetime aftertax loss of approximately 180200 or 019021 per diluted common sharebecause the sicad market is auctionbased and auctions are held periodically during each quarter the exchange rate available through sicad may vary throughout the year which would cause additional remeasurements of cp venezuelas local currencydenominated net monetary assets and further impact cp venezuelas ongoing resultsalthough as described above there is considerable uncertainty with respect to the implementation of the sicad rate the company anticipates that there also will be ongoing impacts primarily related to the translation of the local financial statements and to a lesser degree the import of materials at the new exchange rate while it is still unclear the company believes that some of its imports may still qualify for the official rate of 630 bolivares fuerte per dollar based on this assumption and the sicad rate at the most recent 1170 bolivares fuertes per dollar the company preliminarily estimates that the ongoing impacts during 2014 would be in the range of 011014 per diluted common share as part of the january 2014 announcements the venezuelan government also issued a new law on fair pricing establishing a maximum profit margin of 30 at this time it is unclear based on the current regulations how this new law may affect cp venezuela and its current pricing structure and as a result its impact is not included in the range of estimated ongoing impacts outlined abovethe companys business in venezuela and the companys ability to repatriate its earnings continue to be negatively affected by these difficult conditions and would be further negatively affected by additional devaluations or the imposition of additional or more stringent controls on foreign currency exchange pricing payments profits or imports or other governmental actions or continued or increased labor unrest the company continues to actively manage its investment in and exposure to venezuelain the fourth quarter of 2012 the company commenced a fouryear global growth and efficiency program the 2012 restructuring program for sustained growth the programs

the global marketplace in which the company operates has always been highly competitive the company continues to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from local competitors and other large multinational companies some of which have greater resources than the company does such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion additionally the company continues to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations and high commodity costs while the company has taken and will continue to take measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions should they persist they could adversely affect the companys future resultsthe company believes it is well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to its strong financial condition experience operating in challenging environments and continued focus on the companys strategic initiatives engaging to build our brands innovation for growth effectiveness and efficiency and leading to win this focus together with the strength of the companys global brand names its broad international presence in both mature and

access to global credit and capital marketscash flownet cash provided by operations was 3204 in 2013 compared to 3196 in 2012 and 2896 in 2011 net cash provided by operations for 2013 increased as strong operating earnings and a continued tight focus on working capital were partially offset by higher cash spending related to the 2012 restructuring program the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to higher operating earnings lower voluntary benefit plan contributions and decreased working capital partially offset by higher income tax payments and payment of the fine in the previously disclosed french competition law matter the company defines working capital as the difference between current assets excluding cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities the latter of which is reported in other current assets and current liabilities excluding shortterm debt the companys working capital as a percentage of net sales was 07 in both 2013 and 2012

expected to remain at an annual rate of approximately 45 of net sales which is higher than the historical rate of approximately 35 primarily due to the 2012 restructuring program financing activities used 2142 of cash during 2013 compared to 2301 and 1242 during 2012 and 2011 respectively the decrease in cash used in 2013 as compared to 2012 was primarily due to a lower level of share repurchases partially offset by higher dividends paid and lower proceeds from exercises of stock options the increase in 2012 was primarily due to lower net proceeds from the issuance of debt an increase in

of foreign earnings it intends to repatriate to help fund its domestic cash needs and provides applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes on such earningsas of december 31 2013 the company had approximately 4700 of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which no us income or foreign withholding taxes have been provided as the company does not currently anticipate a need to repatriate these earnings these earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and therefore are not subject to such taxes should these earnings be repatriated in the future they would be subject to applicable us income and foreign withholding taxes determining the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not

manufacturing and selling its products in currencies other than the us dollar the company manages its foreign currency exposures through a combination of costcontainment measures sourcing strategies selling price increases and the hedging of certain costs in an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements see the results of operations section above for discussion

subsidiaries the duration of foreign currency contracts generally does not exceed 12 months and the contracts are valued using observable market ratesthe companys foreign currency forward contracts

considered unlikely and any nonperformance is unlikely to be material as it is the companys policy to contract with diverse creditworthy counterparties based upon both strong credit ratings and other credit considerations recent accounting pronouncementsin july 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201311 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists the new guidance is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2013 and interim periods within those years this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations critical accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements requires management to use judgment and make estimates the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed actual results could ultimately differ from those estimates the accounting policies that are most critical in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statements and require significant or complex judgments and estimates on the part of management the companys critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of directorsin certain instances accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods the companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for shipping and handling costs and inventoriesshipping and handling costs may be reported as either a component of cost of sales or selling general and administrative expenses the company reports such costs primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statements of income as a component of selling general and administrative expenses accordingly the companys gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those companies that include shipping and handling charges in cost of sales if such costs had been included in cost of sales gross profit margin would have decreased by 750 bps from 586 to 511 in 2013 and decreased by 740 bps and 750 bps in 2012 and 2011 respectively with no impact on reported earningsthe company accounts for inventories using both the firstin firstout fifo method 80 of inventories and the lastin firstout lifo method 20 of inventories there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for 2013 2012 or 2011 had all inventories been accounted for under the fifo method 38dollars in millions except per share amountsthe areas of accounting that involve significant or complex judgments and estimates are pensions and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reservesin pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate and the longterm rate of return on plan assets the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for us defined benefit plans was 496 414 and 490 as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other us postretirement plans was 524 432 and 526 as of december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively discount rates used for the us and international defined benefit and other postretirement plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of highquality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plans the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets for us plans was 680 as of december 31 2013 730 as of december 31 2012 and 775 as of december 31 2011 in determining the longterm rate of return the company considers the nature of the plans investments and the historical rate of returnaverage annual rates of return for the us plans for the most recent 1year 5year 10year 15year and 25year periods were 9 11 7 6 and 8 respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the us plans is based upon the nature of the plans investments with a target asset allocation of approximately 53 in fixed income securities 27 in equity securities and 20 in real estate and other investments as the funded status of the plans improved in 2013 the company reallocated a portion of the assets of the us plans from equity securities to fixed income securities and other investments a 1 change in the assumed rate of return on plan assets of the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 11 a 1 change in the discount rate for the us pension plans would impact future net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by approximately 3 a third assumption is the longterm rate of compensation increase a change in which would partially offset the impact of a change in either the discount rate or the longterm rate of return this rate was 350 as of december 31 2013 350 as of december 31 2012 and 400 as of december 31 2011 refer to note 10 retirement plans and other retiree benefits to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys pension and other postretirement plansthe assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefits is the medical cost trend rate the company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the us postretirement benefit plans is 70 for 2014 declining to 50 by 2020 and remaining at 50 for the years thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost components of a 1 increase in the assumed longterm medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgatepalmolive company by 6the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments such as stock options and restricted stock units based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant the company uses the blackscholesmerton blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option awards the weightedaverage estimated fair value of each stock option granted for the year ended december 31 2013 was 741 the blackscholes model uses various assumptions to determine the fair value of options these assumptions include the expected term of options expected volatility riskfree interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumptions do not require significant judgment as the significant inputs are determined from historical experience or independent thirdparty sources changes in these inputs could result in significant changes in fair value a oneyear change in term would result in a change in fair value of approximately 8 a 1 change in volatility would change fair value by approximately 6goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets such as the companys global brands are subject to impairment tests at least annually the company performs either a quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of its reporting units for goodwill and fair value of its indefinite life intangible assets the asset impairment analysis performed for both goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets requires several estimates including future cash flows consistent with managements strategic plans sales growth rates foreign exchange rates and the selection of a discount rate qualitative factors in addition to those quantitative measures discussed above include assessments of general macroeconomic conditions industryspecific considerations and historical financial performance 39dollars in millions except per share amountsthe estimated fair value of the companys intangible assets substantially exceeds the recorded book value except for the intangible assets acquired in the sanex acquisition in 2011 which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the companys reporting units also substantially exceeds the recorded book value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant changes in these estimates would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these assets asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed assets in connection with the 2012 restructuring program requires managements best estimate of net realizable values asset impairment analysis related to the fixed assets of the companys subsidiary in venezuela requires managements best estimate of future exchange rates between the us dollar and the bolivar fuerte the rate of inflation in venezuela and the timing and amount of future selling price increases for products sold in venezuelathe recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions involves consideration of the amounts and probabilities of various outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate resolutiontax valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets such as tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factors considered in estimating net realizable value include historical results by tax jurisdiction carryforward periods income tax strategies and forecasted taxable incomelegal and other contingency reserves are based on managements assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisors such assessments are reviewed each period and revised based on current facts and circumstances if necessary while it is possible that the companys cash flows and results of operations in a particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingencies it is the opinion of management that these matters will not have a material impact on the companys financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows refer to note 13 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys contingenciesthe company generates revenue through the sale of wellknown consumer products to trade customers under established trading terms while the recognition of revenue and receivables requires the use of estimates there is a short time frame typically less than 60 days between the shipment of product and

assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements includes pension and other retiree benefit cost assumptions stockbased compensation asset impairments uncertain tax positions tax valuation allowances and legal and other contingency reserves additionally the company uses available market information and other valuation methodologies in assessing the fair value of financial

disclosed below the company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is 0 to approximately 250 based on current exchange rates the estimates included in this amount are based on the companys analysis of currently available information and as new information is obtained these estimates may change due to the inherent
