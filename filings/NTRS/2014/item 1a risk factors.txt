  from an investors standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each companys unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trusts business    29    table of contents we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so  we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive  economic market and monetary policy risks  northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trusts businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results           a downturn in economic conditions such as the recent severe global economic downturn can negatively affect our earnings           economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which reduce our earnings           economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our clients assets for example the recent downturn in equity markets and the decrease in the value of some debtrelated investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others this reduces our earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values           weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings           a slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth we believe we have profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing any slowing or reversal of this globalization of financial activity and markets or other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in northern trusts growth            uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the eu the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions european market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices continuing economic challenges in europe and the related disruptions may negatively impact our earnings see the    30    table of contents       section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned asset quality and credit risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4047           instability disruption or a lack of confidence in the political economic legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate could expose us to liability or loss northern trusts expanding business activities in emerging markets including investments made for clients in those markets present risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments           changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings rates that remain persistently low may reduce our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a low interest rate environment can also reduce fees earned on certain of our products for example during 20092013 we waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementinterest rate risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4749           volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our earnings periods of lower foreign currency volatility can result in reduced foreign exchange trading income we hold various nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and maintain investments in nonus subsidiaries we also provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business and effect other transactions in nonus dollar currencies foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of nonus dollar denominated assets investments and cash flows and raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods if the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange volatility including hedgingrelated strategies are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks our results and earnings may be negatively affected see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementforeign currency risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4950           declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions generally the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values available from third party sources the recent period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular to the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be otherthantemporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

consolidated financial statements pages 7579 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for additional information            changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings in past periods reductions in the volatility of currency trading markets the level of crossborder investing activity or the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected in a few of our businesses such    31    table of contents       as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings so that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues the recent extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs such market conditions also have reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a persistence or worsening of these conditions could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned offbalance sheet arrangementsvariable interests in the 2013 annual report to stockholders page 32 and note 28variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements pages 110111 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for additional information           changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies can reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects for example the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings the actions of the federal reserve board can reduce the value of financial instruments we hold its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available this can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us           failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us our success in the area of highly complex asset servicing relationships depends in part on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy insolvency or illiquidity if we fail to develop or successfully implement contingency plans for these market disruptions our results and business may be negatively affected           governmental action to combat economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed and may otherwise negatively affect us since mid2008 there have been unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit in response to these developments the us and other governments have taken steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular the upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on northern trust to the extent that these governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry these developments could have an adverse impact on northern trusts revenues costs credit losses access to capital and liquidity they also may impose additional limitations or costs on northern trusts business  operational risks           errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities northern trust effects or processes transactions for clients and for itself that involve very large amounts of money failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses           many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size scale and scope including           human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures    32    table of contents        theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties           defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems           breakdowns in processes including manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes overreliance on manual processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations           unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades           defects in product design or delivery           difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from vendors           negative developments in relationships with key counterparties vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and           external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorism           our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses automated systems to record and process transactions as well as to monitor positions and price assets reduce the risk of human error but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws or manipulation of those systems will result in losses the failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations additionally failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations           breaches of our security measures can result in losses we rely heavily on information technology to conduct our business and any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and northern trusts proprietary information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access our clients proprietary information or our own proprietary information for example outside parties may attempt to use social engineering schemes such as phishing to manipulate employees or clients into disclosing sensitive information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients    33    table of contents        we may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected           our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures our business continuity plans address many of these risks but may not operate successfully to mitigate them if they do not we could incur losses liability to clients or others and reduced earnings           inability of our internal controls to keep pace with our expansion may result in losses in recent years we have expanded our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types a failure to put controls in place to mitigate new risks associated with this expansion may disrupt our operations resulting in losses           failure of any of our third party vendors to perform can result in losses third party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense           northern trusts reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss or disclosure of our clients or our own information northern trust makes extensive use of online services and centralized data processing including through third party service providers the secure maintenance and transmission of client information is a critical element of our operations our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit client information or those of service providers or business partners may be impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner as a result northern trusts clients information may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without the clients consent any such loss disclosure or access to clients information can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition  these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services  see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementoperational risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 5051  investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks  revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings           failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects           if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could negatively affect our earnings managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses failure to comply with these standards adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability           we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings we may find it appropriate to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted    34    table of contents credit risks  a number of northern trusts product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases derivatives foreign exchange and other credit commitments           failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings we evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings           weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans for a fuller discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses for 2013 2012 and 2011 see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned asset quality and credit risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4047           the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have significant counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties or in some cases of our clients counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss the recent instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict in addition as us and nonus governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk    35    table of contents liquidity risks  northern trust depends on access to capital markets and shortterm funding to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients           many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs our ability to raise capital and in turn our ability to meet our commitments inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability restrict our ability to grow or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings among the developments that could have this effect are           a loss of confidence of debt purchasers depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with northern trust           disruption in the market for debtrelated securities and           a significant downgrade of any of our debt ratings credit agencies ratings can change and they often adjust their methodology credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities including asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratings agencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally a significant downgrade in northern trusts debt ratings could increase the costs and availability of short and longterm funding negatively impacting our profitability and our ability to meet client needs           our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity our failure to successfully manage these liquidity and balance sheet issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow           if the bank or the other subsidiaries of the corporation were unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries the corporation relies primarily on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise see regulation and supervision in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k  see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned liquidity and capital resources in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 3239 including the discussion of the possible negative effects of a significant downgrade of any of the corporations debt ratings page 34  regulation risks  virtually every aspect of northern trusts business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally    36    table of contents        failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we are also subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us in enforcement matters claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible           the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes such as           changes to the bank and bank holding company supervisory structure           changes to regulatory capital requirements           creation of new government regulatory agencies           limitation and prohibition of certain activities by the volcker rule           changes in insured depository institution regulations and           mortgage loan origination and risk retention  there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices impose upon us more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition for a more detailed description of the doddfrank act see businessregulation and supervisionthe doddfrank act           changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators            compliance with evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict laws regulations economic sanctions and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully as noted above the doddfrank act will impose many new regulatory requirements on banking institutions the full impacts of which are difficult to determine at this time it is expected that additional legislative or regulatory requirements will continue to be imposed in the us and in other countries and existing legislative or regulatory requirements may be reinterpreted in the us or in other countries in each case in a way that may have an adverse impact on our business activities our costs of    37    table of contents       compliance and our revenues and earnings additionally our understanding of legislative or regulatory requirements might be different than the enforcers understanding of the regulations moreover many regulatory initiatives including antimoney laundering rules antibribery laws home mortgage lending and loan modification requirements and other regulatory requirements or priorities could increase compliance costs and legal risks and could lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict           potential additional regulation of money market mutual funds mmmf could lower the desirability of mmmfs for investors and reduce the profitability of mmmf sponsors on june 5 2013 the sec issued a proposed rule regarding mmmf reform the sec proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform either requiring mmmfs to transact at a floating net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a mmmfs liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions the comment period for these alternative proposals closed on september 17 2013 and no final rule has been issued to date because of the uncertainty as to whether the sec will issue final rules and what the final rules will require the corporation and the bank cannot fully evaluate such reforms impact to their business at this time           the federal reserve board frb policies on interest rates can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition the frbs policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin as a result of the frbs concerns regarding among other things continued slow economic growth and a weak housing market the frb recently indicated that it intends to keep the target range for the federal funds rate near zero until unemployment levels and inflation are under control the frb also may increase its purchases of us government and mortgagebacked securities or take other actions in an effort to reduce or maintain low longterm interest rates  see regulation and supervision in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k  litigation risks  our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk           litigation can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation which could result in a loss even where we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial even claims made against us without merit may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders and so negatively affect our earnings           we may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability with a negative effect on our earnings we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to us gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate    38    table of contents see note 24contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements pages 101102 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for a discussion of current legal proceedings and litigationrelated financial reserves  tax risks  in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due           these challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings           changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and the corporations actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact the corporations tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings  accounting risks           changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards resulting both from initiatives of the financial accounting standards board or their convergence efforts with the international accounting standards board as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in us generally accepted accounting principles potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods  strategic and competitive risks  we have grown through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans           if we do not successfully execute strategic plans we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies in each business unit a failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth a failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems           failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results another goal of innovation as a part of our business strategy is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets    39    table of contents        failure to attract and retain skilled people could negatively affect our prospects our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key talent competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire and retain key personnel including as a result of any restrictions on our compensation practices that may be imposed by governments or regulators the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel           we face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets in which pricing can be a key competitive factor merger activity in the financial services industry including mergers resulting from government intervention and the overall disruption in the financial services industry continues to produce large in some cases wellcapitalized and geographicallydiverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions
