resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators  a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or

entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in light of the complexity of the final regulation the uncertain implementation of the final rule and the possible regulatory and legislative changes to the final rule the corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the volcker rule on its business at this time  swaps and other derivatives title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be pushed out of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a major swap participant a swap dealer a majorsecuritybased swap participant or a securitybased swap dealer the cftc and sec have finalized

obligations the scope of registration requirements central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps rules have also been issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop  consumer financial protection the doddfrank act established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers for banking organizations with assets of 10 billion or more including the bank the cfpb has exclusive rule making and examination and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb this new federal and state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services with potentially significant increases in compliance costs  incentive compensation arrangements the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions on april 14 2011 federal regulators including the fdic the federal reserve board and the sec issued a proposed rule which among other things would require certain executive officers of covered financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation to defer at least 50 of their annual incentivebased compensation for a minimum of three years no final rule has been issued to date  the requirements of the doddfrank act will continue to be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporations operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporations banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporations business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage    7    table of contents  requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporations business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements  holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia  under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions default means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution  the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that control the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements the term source of financial strength is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress to date no final regulations have been adopted  this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions  payment of dividends  the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements  the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding companys financial health such as by borrowing  various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval    8    table of contents the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends  additionally federal reserve board regulations require every bank holding company domiciled in the us that has 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis the federal reserve evaluates an institutions plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock as part of the capital plan reviews in some cases such as when an institutions capital plan has been rejected by the federal reserve the institution is required to receive approval from the federal reserve before making capital distributions the corporation submitted its capital plan as a part of the federal reserves 2013 capital plan review cappr and the federal reserve did not object to the corporations plan the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve in january 2014 as part of the federal reserves 2014 comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar  capital adequacy requirements  the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institutions financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factors  the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation as of december 31 2013 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for core banks including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 additionally on july 2 2013 the federal bank regulatory agencies introduced new capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules designed to implement the revised standards of the basel committee published in december 2010 and revised in june 2011 basel iii these basel iii rules will come into effect between january 1 2014 and january 1 2019  under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least four percent unless the institution is ranked a composite 1 under the camels rating system of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets    9    table of contents the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2013 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as wellcapitalized are provided in the following chart                        riskbased and leverage capital ratios as ofdecember 31 2013        tier 1capital     totalcapital     tier 1leverageratio          northern

final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy  in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and must satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010 the corporations uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements  on september 12 2010 the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee announced agreement on the calibration and phasein arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements known as basel iii on july 2 2013 the federal reserve board issued final rules implementing basel iii in the united states under these rules when fully phasedin banking organizations will be required to satisfy four riskbased capital ratios           a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 45           a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60           a total capital ratio of at least 80 and           a leverage ratio of at least 40 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation will also be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30  under the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act we are subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach we will therefore be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy under the prompt corrective action framework on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and publicly disclose their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014 current results from the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework have demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments we provided to the federal reserve regarding our approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets has not resulted in common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as wellcapitalized these results show that as of december 31 2013 the corporations common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 116 on a fully phasedin basis while the corporations common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 111 on a fully phasedin basis  basel iii also introduces a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount greater than 25 of its total riskweighted assets the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of    10    table of contents  economic stress banking organizations with a tier 1 common equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduces a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures  the uss implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital in october 2013 the us banking agencies proposed a rule that would introduce quantitative liquidity requirements in the us for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank the ultimate impact of the us implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and its bank subsidiaries is currently being reviewed at this point we cannot determine the ultimate effect these final and proposed regulations would have upon our earnings or financial position however we believe our capital strength balance sheet and business model leave us well positioned for the us implementation of basel iii  prompt corrective action  under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized us banking institutions us banking institutions are assigned one of five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a banking institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2013 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as wellcapitalized  as noted above on december 20 2011 the federal reserve board requested comment on a proposed rule to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 early remediation requirements similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firms financial condition deteriorates triggers for remediation include capital levels stress test results and risk management weaknesses no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date  examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies  a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of unsafe or unsound circumstances exist    11    table of contents the fdic may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institutions regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions  restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders  fdicinsured banks including the corporations bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain covered transactions including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending banks capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending banks capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms length  the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminated  the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institutions total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders  antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control  under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus clients financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institutions compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations    12    table of contents the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities  many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporations nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions  deposit insurance and assessments  the banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits  fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institutions deposit insurance assessment is based on that institutions risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institutions risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators the institutions capital levels and other risk measures  the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 where it remains today the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act  the fdic has implemented a revised rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing the final rule mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the prior assessment base the rules assessment rates are lower than the previous rates which achieves the fdics goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the rule adopts a scorecard assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the previous system  continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank    13    table of contents interstate banking and branching  the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding companys home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged  in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state  community reinvestment act  the bank is subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a banks record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a banks performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank received an outstanding cra rating from its regulator in its most recent cra examination  in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the banks cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a wholesale bank as a result of this redesignation the bank now fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans  in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry as of december 31 2013 the bank is not a party to any such agreements  privacy and security  federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches  consumer laws and regulations  in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporations banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to    14    table of contents  substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws  many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above  money market mutual funds  on june 5 2013 the sec proposed a rule regarding money market mutual funds mmmf reform the sec proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform either requiring mmmfs to transact at a floating net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a mmmfs liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions the comment period for these alternative proposals closed on september 17 2013 no final rule has been issued to date because of the uncertainty as to whether the sec will issue final rules and what the final rules will require the corporation and the bank cannot fully evaluate such reforms impact to their business at this time  future legislation  federal state local and nonus legislators and regulators regularly introduce measures or take actions that would modify the regulatory requirements applicable to banks their holding companies and their affiliates such legislation
