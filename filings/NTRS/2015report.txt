banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators  a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the

act the federal reserve board and fdic have jointly issued a final rule requiring the corporation to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the

us bankruptcy code would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the united states no viable private sector alternative is available to prevent the default of the corporation and orderly liquidation authority proceedings would mitigate these adverse effects this determination must be recommended by twothirds of the fdic board of directors and twothirds of the federal reserve board absent such actions the corporation as a bank holding company would remain subject to the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority became effective in july 2010 and rulemaking is proceeding in stages if the corporation were subject to orderly liquidation authority the fdic would be appointed as its receiver which would give the fdic considerable powers to resolve the corporation including 1 the power to remove officers and directors responsible for the corporations failure and to appoint new directors and officers 2 the power to assign assets and liabilities to a third party or bridge financial company without the need for creditor consent or prior court review 3 the ability to differentiate among creditors including by treating junior creditors better than

or other ownership interest in such private funds except for certain limited investments a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the fund or permitting the fund to use the name of the bank the rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule northern trust is reviewing its activities affected by the final volcker rule regulations and is taking steps to bring those activities into conformity with the volcker rule northern trust also is in the process of establishing the necessary compliance programs to comply with the final volcker rule regulations the impact of the volcker rule on northern trust will ultimately depend on the interpretation and implementation by the regulatory agencies responsible for its oversight  swaps and other derivatives title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be pushed out of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a major swap participant a swap dealer a majorsecuritybased swap participant or a securitybased swap dealer the cftc and sec have finalized joint rules further defining these entities and the cftc sec and other us regulators are in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii the cftc has also finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for

with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things recordkeeping obligations the scope of securitybased swap dealer and majorsecuritybased swap participant registration requirements central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop  incentive compensation arrangements the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions no final rule has been issued to date    holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia  under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions default means the appointment of a

obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions  the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies such as the corporation to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the term source of financial strength is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress    payment of dividends  the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements  various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval  the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends                       6     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents capital planning and stress testing  the corporations capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve boards comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan if the plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios and a tier 1 common to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 5 calculated under general riskbased capital rules as currently in effect in each case on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios including a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve board the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios and maintain a tier 1 common to riskweighted assets ratio of at least 5  the purpose of ccar is to ensure that these bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the ccar rule consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance provides that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny the corporations common stock dividend payout ratio was 392 in 2014  the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in january 2014 as part of the federal reserve boards 2014 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporations plan in january 2015 the

plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases on march 11 2015 the corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2015 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter  in addition to the ccar stress testing requirements federal reserve board regulations also include the new doddfrank act stress tests dfast the ccar and dfast requirements substantially overlap and the federal reserve board implements them at the bank holding company level on a coordinated basis under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal

general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factors  the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation as of january 1 2015 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of                       7     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust

these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2014 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators  under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank were required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014  pursuant to the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy under the prompt corrective action framework described further below  the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as wellcapitalized are provided in the following chart    table 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2014

effective january 1 2015 the applicable minimum common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital and total capital ratios to be considered wellcapitalized are 65 80 and 100 respectively    in addition to the above beginning in 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio which the federal reserve board finalized in 2014 under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institution subsidiaries of advanced approaches institutions such as the bank will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered wellcapitalized under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratio  basel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0625 in 2016 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the                       8     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures  the uss implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital however the corporation and the bank believe their capital strength balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued us implementation of basel iii    liquidity standards  in addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organizations total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr will be phased in beginning on january 1 2015 at 80 with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 beginning with january 2015 northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a monthly basis daily calculation of the lcr will be required beginning with july 2016 the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the nsfr  in march 2014 the federal reserve board issued enhanced prudential standards which specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank effective january 1 2015 these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the board of directors also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trusts business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcr    prompt corrective action  the fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiary  as noted above in december 2011 the federal reserve board issued proposed rules to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 early remediation requirements similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firms financial condition deteriorates no final rule                       9     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  implementing section 166 has been issued to date and the final rules implementing section 165 indicate that the federal reserve board is continuing to consider the comments it received to the proposal    restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders  the corporations bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain covered transactions including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending banks capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending banks capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms length  the doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminated  the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institutions total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders    antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control  the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to the bank secrecy act of 1970 as amended by the usa patriot act of 2001 which contains antimoney laundering aml and financial transparency provisions and requires implementation of regulations applicable to financial services companies including standards for verifying client identification and monitoring client transactions and detecting and reporting suspicious activities aml laws outside the us contain similar requirements the corporation and its subsidiaries have implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable aml laws and regulations compliance with applicable aml and related requirements is a common area of review for financial regulators and the corporations and its subsidiaries level of compliance with these requirements could result in fines penalties lawsuits regulatory sanctions or difficulties in obtaining approvals restrictions on their business activities or harm to their reputation  the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of

imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporations nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions    deposit insurance and assessments  the bank accepts deposits and those deposits have the benefit of fdic insurance up to the applicable limit the current limit for fdic insurance for deposit accounts is 250000 for each depositor account under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the insured depository institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by a banks federal regulatory agency the fdics deposit insurance fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions as required by the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule in february 2011 that changed the assessment base from insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity and changed the assessment rate calculation effective on april 1 2011 under the final rule the fdic concluded that certain liquid assets could be excluded from the deposit insurance assessment base of custody banks that satisfy certain institutional eligibility criteria this has the effect of reducing the amount of deposit insurance fund insurance premiums due from custody banks    money market mutual funds  on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules will occur in phases from july 2015 through october 2016 money market mutual fund reforms also have been proposed by the european union as part of its approach to addressing shadow banking the timing and content of the final eu regulation is uncertain at this time on january 29 2014 the eu published a legislative proposal aimed at increasing the transparency of certain transactions in the shadow banking sector which includes provisions for enhanced transparency and reporting of securities financing transactions    community reinvestment act  the bank is subject to the community reinvestment act cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a banks record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a banks performance under the cra in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the banks cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a wholesale bank as a result of this designation the bank fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans the bank received an outstanding cra rating from the federal reserve board in its most recent cra examination    privacy and security  federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states and the eu have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches                       11     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents consumer laws and regulations  the corporations banking subsidiaries are subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the doddfrank act established an independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb was tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws    nonus regulation  northern trusts nonus branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate for example branches and subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom are authorized to do so pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act 2000 or are otherwise subject to regulation by the prudential regulation authority pra andor the financial conduct authority fca the pra and fca exercise broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to revoke temporarily or permanently authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their regulated employees  northern trusts european branches and subsidiaries are subject to the laws and

administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ucits v will become effective in march 2016 although secondary legislation setting out technical details with respect to ucits v remains in the process of being drafted ultimately ucits v will introduce rules for the depositary rules on remuneration policies for certain staff and a sanctions regime for noncompliance  a number of other new regulations that may affect northern trusts operations have recently been or are currently being implemented in europe including the capital requirements directive iv referred to as crd iv and the bank recovery and resolution directive the eu and some member states also are considering bank structural reform on january 29 2014 the eu published a proposal that would prohibit proprietary trading by inscope banking groups and potentially require that trading activities only be carried out by a trading entity legally economically and operationally separate from the deposittaking entities within the banking group northern trust is working diligently to comply with aifmd emir ucits v and other eu rules and regulations and is also monitoring the development of eu proposals that might create challenges or opportunities for it  additionally the banks and the corporations subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to

activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could adversely affect us we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may face  these risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k    market risks  a downturn in economic conditions such as the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant economic turmoil may negatively affect our earnings  our principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the volume of transactions processed the market value of assets under management or custody securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be negatively impacted by a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments as a result of market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally reduced our earnings weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services reduced transaction volumes would also generally negatively impact our earnings economic weakness may also affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings    changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings  the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings rates that remain persistently low may reduce our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a low interest rate environment can also reduce fees earned on certain of our products for example since 2009 we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings please see market risk in the risk management section included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of interest rate and market risks we face    changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects   the monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds                       15     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operations    uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the eu the risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings  there remain ongoing concerns about the ability of certain european countries to finance their deficits and service their debt burdens risks and ongoing concerns about the financial stability of these countries could have a detrimental impact on the continued global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions european market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices continuing economic challenges in europe including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions and related disruptions may negatively impact our earnings    declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings  our investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represents a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular to the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination    volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earnings  we provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income  we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods  we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may negatively impact earnings please see market risk in the risk management section included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we face    changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings  in past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities                       16     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  may be negatively affected in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could negatively impact our earnings    operational risks  many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings  we regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope include    ÿ    human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures    ÿ    theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties    ÿ    defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems    ÿ    breakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations    ÿ    unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades    ÿ    defects in product design or delivery    ÿ    difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from vendors    ÿ    negative developments in relationships with key counterparties vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and    ÿ    external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorism    while we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate effectively these risks if they do not such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be adversely impacted    the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we face  we use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to accurately quantify the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which could ultimately have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences                       17     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways  in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for us that involve very large amounts of money failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected    our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses  our businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to among other things record and process a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations    breaches of our security measures may result in losses  any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and our proprietary information and security breaches  including cyberattacks  could expose us to a risk of loss of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients proprietary information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to appropriately conduct our business activities  the third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be adversely affected perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business  in recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not suffered a material breach of our systems it is possible that we could suffer such a breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyber threats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients or other parties confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients or other parties business assets

occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients    our reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss or disclosure of our or our clients information  the secure maintenance and transmission of client information is a critical element of our operations our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit client information or those of service providers or business partners may be impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a thirdparty service provider or business partner or by a security breach as a result our clients information may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without the clients consent any such loss disclosure or access to clients information can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations    inability of our internal controls to keep pace with our expansion may result in losses  in recent years we have expanded our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types a failure to put controls in place to mitigate new risks associated with this expansion may disrupt our operations resulting in losses    a failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement other expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraud    failure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in losses  thirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could also create significant delay and expense    we are subject to certain risks inherent in operating globally which may adversely affect our business  in conducting our business we are subject to risks of loss from various unfavorable political economic legal or other developments including social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets price controls capital controls exchange controls unfavorable tax rates and tax court rulings and changes in laws and regulations less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments heighten these risks in various emerging markets in which we have been expanding our business activities our nonus operations accounted for 31 of our revenue in 2014 our nonus businesses are subject to extensive regulation by various nonus regulators including governments securities exchanges central banks and other regulatory bodies in the jurisdictions in which those businesses operate in many countries the laws and regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving and may be applied with extra scrutiny to foreign companies further it may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in every market or manage our relationships with multiple regulators in                       19     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to properly mitigate such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could adversely affect our business and results of operations  we actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service delivery  in addition we are subject in our global operations to rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal payments and money laundering as well as laws relating to doing business with certain individuals groups and countries such as the us foreign corrupt practices act the usa patriot act and the uk bribery act while we have invested and continue to invest significant resources in training and in compliance monitoring the geographical diversity of our operations employees clients and customers as well as the vendors and other third parties that we deal with presents the risk that we may be found in violation of such rules regulations or laws and any such violation could subject us to significant penalties or adversely affect our reputation    failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our earnings  our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results through various parts of our business strategy including innovation we aim to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets failure to control these and other costs could negatively affect our earnings    acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics and global conflicts may have a negative impact on our business and operations  acts of terrorism natural disasters pandemics global conflicts or other similar catastrophic events could have a negative impact on our business and operations while we have in place business continuity plans such events could still damage our facilities disrupt or delay the normal operations of our business including communications and technology result in harm or cause travel limitations on our employees and have a similar impact on our clients suppliers and counterparties these events could also negatively impact the purchase of our products and services to the extent that those acts or conflicts result in reduced capital markets activity lower asset price levels or disruptions in general economic activity in the united states or abroad or in financial market settlement functions in addition war terror attacks political unrest global conflicts the national and global efforts to combat terrorism and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities may negatively impact economic growth which could have an adverse effect on our business and operations and may have other adverse effects on us in ways that we are unable to predict    credit risks  failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings  we evaluate extensions of credit before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate may require us to realize increased provisions for credit losses or write down the value of certain assets on our balance sheet which in turn would directly and negatively affect earnings                       20     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings  credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by weakness in the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers resulting from weakened economic conditions could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans which could in turn negatively impact our financial condition and results of earnings    the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss  the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss instability in the financial markets has resulted historically in some financial institutions becoming less creditworthy during such periods of instability we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly are often based upon a variety of factors and can be difficult to predict in addition the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain in recent years the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations    liquidity risks  if the bank is unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations  the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries the corporation relies on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the corporations other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise dividend payments by the bank to the corporation in the future will require continued generation of earnings by the bank and could require regulatory approval under certain circumstances for more information on dividend restrictions see supervision and regulationpayment of dividends in item 1 business    we may need to raise additional capital in the future which may not be available to us or may only be available on unfavorable terms  we may need to raise additional capital to provide sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings or otherwise adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan capital plan and strategic goals                       21     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents any downgrades in our credit ratings or an actual or perceived reduction in our financial strength could adversely affect our borrowing costs capital costs and liquidity  rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratings agencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally  downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business  the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be materially compromised if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly    our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity  a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to successfully manage the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow    regulatory and legal risks  failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings  virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations similarly failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition    the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations  the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies as some provisions still require final rules to be promulgated further changes                       22     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements    changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings  the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements could ultimately impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business and earnings see supervision and regulation under item 1 business for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject    the implementation of money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsors  on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise adversely affect our business earnings or financial condition the implementation of these rules will occur in phases from july 2015 through october 2016    further intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly  in recent years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws home mortgage lending and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and would likely involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict    our business may be adversely impacted by litigation and regulatory enforcement   our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk actions brought against us may result in injunctions

effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently negatively affecting our earnings  in the ordinary course of our business we also are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us in enforcement matters claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible    we may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability with a negative effect on our earnings  we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate    if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could negatively affect our earnings  managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses failure to comply with these standards adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability    strategic risks  if we do not successfully execute strategic plans we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted  our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth a failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems    competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could adversely affect our clients perception of our abilities                       24     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings  we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large in some cases wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures these competitive pressures may negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability    damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue  damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could negatively affect our earnings damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business the global financial crisis of 200708 and current political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry could also negatively impact our reputation    we need to constantly invest in innovation and the inability or failure to do so may negatively affect our businesses and earnings  our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities growth and earnings there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all    failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings  our success in capitalizing on innovation depends in part on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings                       25     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions   a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial

both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings  in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings

individual fee arrangements negotiated with each client custody fees related to asset values are client specific and are priced based on quarterend or monthend values values at the beginning of each quarter or average values for a month or quarter the fund administration fees that are assetvaluerelated are priced using monthend quarterend or average daily balances investment management fees which are based generally on client assets under management are based primarily on market values throughout a period  securities lending revenue is affected by market values the demand for securities to be lent which drives volumes and the interest rate spread earned on the investment of cash deposited by investment firms as collateral for securities they have borrowed the other services fee category in

component of the allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay  at december 31 2014 the specific allowance component amounted to 211 million compared with 249 million at the end of 2013 the 38 million decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in nonperforming loans attributable to restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans  the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 325 million in 2012 to 249 million in 2013 was primarily attributable to chargeoffs and payoffs partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    the historical chargeoff experience for each loan category is based on data from the current and preceding three

property values as well as other pertinent information changes in collateral values delinquency ratios portfolio volume and concentration and other asset quality metrics including managements subjective evaluation of economic and business conditions result in adjustments of qualitative allowance factors that are applied in the determination of inherent allowance requirements  the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans  the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 82 million to 2748 million at december 31 2014 compared with 2830 million at december 31 2013 which decreased 121 million from 2951 million at december 31 2012 the decrease in 2014 is primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes the decrease in 2013 reflected improvement in the credit quality of commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loans in certain markets as compared to 2012    overall allowance the evaluation of the factors above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2959 million at december 31 2014 compared with 3079 million at the end of 2013 the allowance of 2670 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 084 at december 31 2014 down from a 2781 million allowance representing 095 of total loans and leases at december 31 2013 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and

the provision for credit losses was 60 million and net chargeoffs totaled 180 million in 2014 this compares with a 200 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 397 million in 2013 and a 250 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 263 million in 2012    impaired loans  a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2014 impaired loans totaled 2422 million and included 1513 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 2934 million at december 31 2013 which included 1625 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 66 million and 104 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loans market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent

for credit losses represents managements estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures  the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components    specific allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral    inherent allowance the amount of inherent allowance is based on factors which incorporate managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors are applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and are reviewed quarterly by northern trusts loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financial management  the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff as described in the asset quality section are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate  loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs  managements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2014 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the

examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements    pension plan accounting  northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods  northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets  in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2014 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 500 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 775  in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trusts december 31 2014 measurement date the following were considered    ÿ    discount rate northern trust estimates the discount rate for its us pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to several published discount rate yield curves as of the measurement date these yield curves are composed of individual zerocoupon interest rates for 60 different time periods over a 30year time horizon zerocoupon rates utilized by the yield curves are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds the yield curve models referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate supported a rate between 394 and 429 with an average decrease of 90 basis points over the prior year as such northern trust decreased the discount rate for the qualified and nonqualified plans from 500 for december 31 2013 to 425 for december 31 2014    ÿ    compensation level based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience the compensation scale assumption is based on a sliding scale that averages 425    ÿ    rate of return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the longterm 30 years rate of return on plan assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trusts rate of return assumption decreased from 775 for 2014 to 725 for 2015    ÿ

carried on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value as discussed more fully in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data gaap requires entities to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a threelevel valuation hierarchy the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted active market prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 14 of northern trusts assets carried at fair value is classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange  approximately 86 of northern trusts assets and 100 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 917 of level 2 assets with the remaining 83 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instruments  northern trusts level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account

remaining lives significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities as of december 31 2014 northern trust had no level 3 liabilities  while northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets

adverse economic conditions while maintaining its ability to capitalize on business opportunities in a timely and cost effective manner liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds to meet on and offbalance sheet cash flow obligations when they are due and payable because of firmspecific or marketwide events    governance and risk management framework  northern trust manages its liquidity under a global risk management framework incorporating regional policies limits and management when appropriate corporate liquidity policies risk appetite and limits are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors in connection with the implementation of enhanced prudential standards in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position the business risk committee receives reports at least quarterly on the corporations liquidity risk profile and liquidity risk tolerance the asset amp liability management policy committee alco is responsible for recommending liquidity policies to the board establishing internal liquidity thresholds assessing northern trusts overall liquidity status and reviewing reports including liquidity stress test results cash flows and other analyses on a regular basis the treasury department has the daytoday responsibility for measuring analyzing and managing liquidity risk within the thresholds and limits established by alco and the board  northern trusts global liquidity management framework focuses on five key areas  position management liquidity analysis contingency planning peer group comparisons and management reporting  while also providing for the review and management of the liquidity of the corporation separate from that of the bank it is through this framework that management monitors its sources and uses of liquidity evaluates their level of stability under various circumstances plans for adverse situations benchmarks itself against other banks provides information to management and complies with various us and international regulations  position management includes daily monitoring of cash positions and anticipating future funding requirements given both internal and external events as the corporations principal subsidiary encompassing all of northern trusts banking activities the bank centrally manages liquidity for all us and international banking operations liquidity is provided by a variety of sources including client deposits institutional and personal from our campis and wealth management businesses wholesale funding from the capital markets maturities of shortterm investments federal home loan bank advances and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity at december 31 2014 the bank had over 255 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings the bank is also very active in the us interbank funding market providing an important source of additional liquidity and lowcost funds liquidity is used by a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net loan growth and draws on commitments to extend credit northern trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet with cash and due from banks deposits with the federal reserve and other central banks shortterm money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 64 of total assets as of december 31 2014 the market value of unencumbered securities at the bank which include those

internal and external events and under different economic conditions northern trust uses liquidity analysis to support its contingent liquidity plans size its liquidity buffer gain insight into its liquidity position and strengthen its liquidity policies and practices liquidity analysis is performed using multiple independent scenarios across major currencies at a consolidated corporate level and for various international banking subsidiaries these scenarios which include both company specific and systemic events analyze potential impacts on northern trusts domestic and foreign deposit

major subsidiaries is approved annually by the business risk committee and regularly updated and tested this plan which can be activated in the event of an actual liquidity crisis details organizational responsibilities and defines specific actions designed to ensure the proper maintenance of liquidity during periods of stress in addition international banking subsidiaries have individual contingent liquidity plans which reflect the global plan  northern trust also analyzes its liquidity profile against a peer group of large us bank holding companies including other major custody banks this analysis provides management with benchmarking information highlights industry trends and supports the establishment of new policies and strategies  management regularly reviews various reports analyses and other information depicting changes in northern trusts liquidity mix and funding concentrations overall financial market conditions and other internal and external liquidity metrics management uses this information to evaluate the overall status of northern trusts liquidity position and anticipate potential events that could stress that position in the future an overall liquidity status level for northern trust established and regularly reviewed by alco is monitored on an ongoing basis by the treasury department downgrades in liquidity status resulting from

partially offset by increases in net collateral deposited with derivative counterparties and in receivables  net cash used in investing activities of 82 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 was primarily attributable to increased levels of federal reserve deposits net purchases of securities held to maturity and available for sale and increased levels of loans and leases partially offset by

discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    for the year ended december 31 2014 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 71 billion primarily attributable to increased levels of total deposits and proceeds from the issuance of series c preferred stock partially offset by repayments of senior notes and other longterm debt the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporations share repurchase program and cash dividends paid to common stockholders the increase in total deposits is attributable to higher levels of demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits the decreases in senior notes and other longterm debt reflect the maturity of 5000 million of fixedrate senior notes and 1350 million of repayments of borrowings from the federal home loan bank respectively  for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 44 billion primarily reflecting increased levels of total deposits and shortterm other borrowings the increase in the level of total deposits was primarily due to an increase in nonusoffice interestbearing client deposits partially offset by decreased usoffice demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits from december 31 2012 levels the decrease in usoffice noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by the expiration on december 31 2012 of the fdics temporary liquidity guarantee program which had provided unlimited deposit insurance the increase in shortterm other borrowings in 2013 reflected additional shortterm borrowings from the federal home

financing or hedge fund leveraging    credit risk framework and governance  the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk management framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive credit risk management this function approves policies establishes the credit risk framework and monitors adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures credit risk management reports directly to the cro independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control  the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trusts diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust these activities are designed to diversify credit exposure on an industry and client basis and reduce overall credit risk  the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credits exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee  the counterparty risk management committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties    credit risk measurement  an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trusts internal risk rating system northern trusts internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk northern trust uses the advanced internal ratingbased approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trusts internal rating system calculations include entityspecific information about the obligors or counterpartys probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity northern trusts internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings  the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system this includes the development monitoring and maintenance of the models as well as providing information to the credit risk management committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control    loans and other extensions of credit  a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and in the offbalancesheet arrangements section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as part of its credit process northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification approval and monitoring of credit risk borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting management reporting setting of loss allowances and economic capital calculations borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements  the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems in addition independent from the credit risk management function credit review as part of risk control undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of managements implementation of the credit risk managements requirements                       74     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for credits with borrower ratings of 6 to 9 these credits which include all nonperforming credits are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default elevated risk of default or are currently in default loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled 4212 million at december 31 2014 cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off    counterparty credit risk  counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions which in turn are derived from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor  to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity    credit risk mitigation  northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories    physical and financial collateral northern trusts primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trusts estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collaterals value    netting onbalance sheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements a subset of these arrangements are conducted under an isda credit support annex northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time    guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trusts claims relative to other creditors northern trust may also recognize implied support where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under us supervisory guidance northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this

sizes  the market risk framework components of risk monitoring risk reporting and analysis and risk measurement are discussed below    interest rate risk overview  interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or common capital due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of capital to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates  there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk    ÿ    repricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities    ÿ    yield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve    ÿ    basis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics and    ÿ    embedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes    interest rate risk measurement reporting and analysis  northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability    sensitivity of earnings soe  the modeling of soe incorporates onbalance sheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions    ÿ    the balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of which some recent increases are assumed to be temporary in nature and longterm fixed rate borrowings that upon maturity are replaced with overnight wholesale instruments    ÿ    prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions                       80     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents

on judgment when there is no appropriate history or when current pricing strategies differ from history    ÿ    commercial demand deposits are treated as shortterm rate sensitive as these balances may receive an explicit interest rate or an earnings credit that can be applied to fees for services provided by northern trust and    ÿ    new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices    the following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pretax earnings of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates given the low level of interest rates the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results    table 37 interest rate risk simulation of pretax earnings

exceed its soe limits    sensitivity of economic value of equity seve  economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100 or 200 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions    ÿ    prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment

alternatives and the riskreturn tradeoffs    foreign currency risk overview  northern trust is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trusts currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense  in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trusts growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk  foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods                       82     2014 annual report

using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio  var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions directly from northern trusts trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies corporate market risk monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness    foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis  northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of alternative risk metrics offering corroborating measures and useful perspectives on northern trusts market risks  automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the corporate

financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates    d foreign currency remeasurement and translation asset and liability accounts denominated in nonfunctional currencies are remeasured into functional currencies at period end rates of exchange except for certain balance sheet items including buildings and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets which are remeasured at historical exchange rates results from remeasurement of asset and liability accounts are reported in other operating income as currency translation gains losses net income and expense accounts are remeasured at period average rates of exchange                       92     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements    asset and liability accounts of entities with functional currencies that are not the us dollar are translated at period end rates of exchange income and expense accounts are translated at period average rates of exchange translation adjustments net of applicable taxes are reported directly to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci a component of stockholders equity    e securities securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses credited or charged net of the tax effect to aoci realized gains and losses on securities available for sale are determined on a specific identification basis and are reported within other security gains losses net in the consolidated statement of income interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount  securities held to maturity consist of debt securities that management intends to and northern trust has the ability to hold until maturity such securities are reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount  securities held for trading are stated at fair value realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held for trading are reported in the consolidated statement of income within security commissions and trading income  nonmarketable securities primarily consist of federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock and community development investments each of which are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock are reported at cost which represents redemption value community development investments are typically reported at amortized cost those community development investments that are designed to generate a return primarily through realization of tax credits and other tax benefits which are discussed in further detail in note 28  variable interest entities are reported at amortized cost using the effective yield method or proportional amortization method and amortized over the lives of the related tax credits and other tax benefits  otherthantemporary impairment otti a security is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are less than the securitys amortized cost basis the difference being defined as the credit loss or if the fair value of the security is less than the securitys amortized cost basis and the investor intends or morelikelythannot will be required to sell the security before recovery of the securitys amortized cost basis if otti exists the charge to earnings is limited to the amount of credit loss if the investor does not intend to sell the security and it is morelikelythannot that it will not be required to sell the security before recovery of the securitys amortized cost basis any remaining difference between fair value and amortized cost is recognized in aoci net of applicable taxes otherwise the entire difference between fair value and amortized cost is charged to earnings    f securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest to minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored limits are set on exposure with counterparties and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed it is northern trusts policy to take possession either directly or via third party custodians of securities purchased under agreements to resell    g derivative financial instruments northern trust is a party to various derivative instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities these instruments include foreign exchange contracts interest rate contracts and credit default swap contracts derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within other assets and other liabilities derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheet in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative in the consolidated statement of income depends on whether or not the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under gaap derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated cash flow statement within the line item other operating activities net except for net investment hedges which are recorded within other investing activities net                       93     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements    changes in the fair value of clientrelated and trading derivative instruments which are not designated hedges under gaap are recognized currently in either foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in other operating income certain derivative instruments used by northern trust to manage risk are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value cash flow or net investment hedges  derivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit northern trusts exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in income for substantially all fair value hedges northern trust applies the shortcut method of accounting available under gaap which assumes there is no ineffectiveness in a hedge as a result changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are equal to the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative and are reflected in the same line item for fair value hedges that do not qualify for the shortcut method of accounting northern trust utilizes regression analysis a longhaul method of accounting in assessing whether these hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter ineffectiveness resulting from fair value hedges is recorded in either interest income or interest expense  derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates the effective portion of changes in the fair value of such derivatives is recognized in aoci a component of stockholders equity and there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item balances in aoci are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings northern trust applies the shortcut method of accounting for cash flow hedges of certain available for sale investment securities for cash flow hedges of certain other available for sale investment securities and forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions northern trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis which limits hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched effectiveness is assessed using the dollaroffset method and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in earnings  foreign exchange contracts and qualifying nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to minimize northern trusts exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in nonus branches and subsidiaries the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in aoci consistent with the related translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment for net investment hedges all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis to minimize the risk of hedge ineffectiveness to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method ineffectiveness resulting from net investment hedges is recorded in other operating income amounts recorded in aoci are reclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a nonus branch or subsidiary  fair value cash flow and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous with the transaction the formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and hedged items included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking such hedges the nature of the risk being hedged a description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis as well as the method that will be used to measure hedge ineffectiveness for hedges that do not qualify for the shortcut or the critical terms match methods of accounting a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective matures is terminated or sold if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur or if northern trust removes the derivatives hedge designation subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income for discontinued cash flow hedges the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in aoci and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is                       94     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements     no longer probable of occurring for discontinued fair value hedges the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value previous adjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item    h loans and leases loans and leases are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates loans and leases are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment segment and by class segment is defined as the level at which management develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses northern trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal a class of loans and leases is a subset of a segment the components of which have similar risk characteristics measurement attributes or risk monitoring methods the classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional commercial real estate lease financing nonus and other the classes within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate private client and other  loan classification loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value loan commitments for residential real estate loans that will be classified as held for sale at the time of funding and which have an interest rate lock are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with subsequent gains or losses recognized in other operating income unrealized gains on these loan commitments are reported as other assets with unrealized losses reported as other liabilities other undrawn commitments relating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in other liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees with an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated probable losses  recognition of income interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless in the opinion of management there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement or interest or principal is more than 90 days contractually past due and the loan is not wellsecured and in the process of collection loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due for disclosure purposes loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current at the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless in the opinion of management collectability of principal is not in doubt managements assessment of indicators of loan and lease collectability and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition do not meaningfully vary between loan and lease classes nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and in accordance with regulatory guidance relate primarily to expected payment performance loans are eligible to be returned to performing status when i no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or ii the loan has otherwise become wellsecured possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt including accrued interest in full and is in the process of collection through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future a loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six months by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms and northern trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time additionally a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status provided there was a welldocumented credit evaluation of the borrowers financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six months under the revised terms  impaired loans a loan is considered to be impaired when based on current information and events management determines that it is probable that northern trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes including the formal review of past due and watch list credits payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases particularly those within the residential real estate private client and personalother classes other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and                       95     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements     institutional nonus lease financing and commercialother classes relate to the borrowers ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the assessment of future cash flows including consideration of collateral value market value and other factors a loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession by northern trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring tdr all tdrs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring in subsequent years a tdr may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least six months a loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the six month performance requirement however it will remain reported as impaired impairment is measured based upon the loans market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan based on the certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 250000 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards northern trusts accounting policies for impaired loans is consistent across all classes of loans and leases  premiums and discounts premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan certain direct origination costs and fees are netted deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loans yield  direct financing and leverage leases unearned lease income from direct financing and leveraged leases is recognized using the interest method this method provides a constant rate of return on the unrecovered investment over the life of the lease the rate of return and the allocation of income over the lease term are recalculated from the inception of the lease if during the lease term assumptions regarding the amount or timing of estimated cash flows change lease residual values are established at the inception of the lease based on inhouse valuations and market analyses provided by outside parties lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otti a decline in the estimated residual value of a leased asset determined to be otherthantemporary would be recorded in the period in which the decline is identified as a reduction of interest income    i allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components  specific allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral  inherent allowance the amount of inherent allowance is based on factors which incorporate managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors are applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and are reviewed quarterly by northern trusts loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management reporting segment management and corporate financial management  loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance northern trusts policies relative to the chargingoff of uncollectible loans and leases are consistent across both loan and lease segments determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established are based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined to be appropriate through the above process actual                       96

provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs  northern trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet activity using a consistent methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be funded factors based on historical loss experience and specific risk characteristics of the loan product are utilized to calculate inherent losses related to undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date the portion of the allowance assigned to loans and leases is reported as a contra asset directly following loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheet  the portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet    j standby letters of credit fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in other operating income using the straightline method over the lives of the underlying agreements northern trusts recorded other liability for standby letters of credit reflecting the obligation it has undertaken is measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instruments    k buildings and equipment buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation the charge for depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on the following range of lives buildings  up to 30 years equipment  3 to 10 years and leasehold improvementsthe shorter of the lease term or 15 years leased properties meeting certain criteria are capitalized and amortized using the straightline method over the lease period    l other real estate owned oreo oreo is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans oreo assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet fair value is typically based on thirdparty appraisals appraisals of oreo properties are updated on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the properties losses identified during the 90day period after the acquisition of such properties are charged against the allowance for credit losses assigned to loans and leases subsequent writedowns that may be required to the carrying value of these assets and gains or losses realized from asset sales are recorded within other operating expense    m goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is not subject to amortization separately identifiable acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily on a straightline basis purchased software and allowable internal costs including compensation relating to software developed for internal use are capitalized software is amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally ranging from 3 to 10 years  goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable    n assets under custody and assets under management assets held in fiduciary or agency capacities are not included on the consolidated balance sheet since such items are not assets of

withdrawals from shortterm investment funds that settle on the following business day northern trust advances cash to the client on the date of the client withdrawal and awaits collection from the shortterm investment funds the following business day    q income taxes northern trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes the objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities the measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates  tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities only tax positions that are considered morelikelythannot to be sustained are recorded in the consolidated financial statements northern trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes    r cash flow statements cash and cash equivalents have been defined as cash and due from banks    s pension and other postretirement benefits northern trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheet prepaid pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other assets and unfunded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other liabilities plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at december 31 pension costs are recognized ratably over the estimated working lifetime of eligible participants    t sharebased compensation plans northern trust recognizes as compensation expense the grantdate fair value of stock and stock unit awards and other sharebased compensation granted to employees within the consolidated income statement the fair values of stock and stock unit awards including performance stock unit awards and director awards are based on the price of the corporations stock on the date of grant the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the model utilizes weightedaverage assumptions regarding the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding expected term based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants the estimated yield from dividends paid on the corporations stock over the expected term of the options the historical volatility of northern trusts stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on northern trust stock and a risk free interest rate based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options granted  compensation expense for sharebased award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period are recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award northern trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of sharebased compensation expense as historical forfeitures have not been significant sharebased compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur dividend equivalents are paid on stock units that have been granted but not yet vested cash flows resulting from the realization of tax deductions from the exercise of stock options in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits are classified as financing cash flows    u net income per common share basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net incomeloss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common shares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common share equivalents calculated for stock options and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method in a period of a net loss diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common share  northern trust has issued certain restricted stock awards which are unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents these restricted shares are considered participating securities                       98     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes

to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date                         99     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements    fair value hierarchy the following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs levels 1 2 and 3 used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by northern trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available gaap requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation northern trusts policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred no transfers between fair value levels occurred during the years ended december 31 2014 or 2013  level 1  quoted active market prices for identical assets or liabilities northern trusts level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in us treasury securities  level 2  observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets northern trusts level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and thirdparty prices if a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed predetermined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset types characteristics the exception is researched and if the price is not able to be validated an alternate pricing vendor is utilized consistent with northern trusts pricing source hierarchy as of december 31 2014 northern trusts available for sale securities portfolio included 881 level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of 250 billion all 881 securities were valued by external pricing vendors as of december 31 2013 northern trusts available for sale securities portfolio included 831 level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of 264 billion of those 829 securities with a market value of 263 billion were valued by external pricing vendors the remaining 2 securities with an aggregate market value of 574 million were valued consistent with prices of similar securities as there were no vended prices available for these securities trading account securities which totaled 47 million and 17 million as of december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively were all valued using external pricing vendors  northern trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities on a daily basis periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous days reported prices for each security predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor quarterly northern trust reviews documentation from thirdparty pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by northern trust to each security classification are appropriate annually valuation inputs used within thirdparty pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs used to comparable market data including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications comprising significant portions of the portfolio  level 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts credit spreads default probabilities and recovery rates for credit default swap contracts interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts northern trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments factors considered include the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material                       100     2014 annual report

unobservable in the marketplace northern trusts level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased in 2008 from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable northern trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities and the applicable discount rates significant increases decreases in the estimated remaining lives or the discount rates in isolation would result in a significantly lower higher fair value measurement level 3 liabilities at december 31 2013 consisted of an acquisitionrelated contingent consideration liability the fair value of which was determined using an incomebased discounted cash flow model that incorporated northern trusts own assumptions about business growth rates and applicable discount rates which represented unobservable inputs to the model in april 2014 northern trust made a payment of 553 million to extinguish the contingent consideration liability at the value agreed by the parties  northern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate however the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets and liabilities could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values  management of various businesses and departments of northern trust including corporate market risk credit risk management corporate financial management campis and wealth management determine the valuation policies and procedures for level 3 assets and liabilities generally valuation policies are reviewed by management of each business or department fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability as necessary the valuation models are reviewed by management of the appropriate business or department and adjusted for changes in inputs management of each business or department reviews the inputs in order to substantiate the unobservable inputs used in each fair value measurement when appropriate management reviews forecasts used in the valuation process in light of other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between current and previous fair value measurements in certain circumstances third party information is used to support the fair value measurements if certain third party information seems inconsistent with consensus views a review of the information is performed by management of the respective business or department to conclude as to the appropriate fair value of the asset or liability  the following presents the fair values of and the valuation techniques significant

which may be maturity  security impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible otti a determination as to whether a securitys decline in market value is otherthantemporary takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security factors northern trust considers in determining

condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer activity in the market of the issuer which may indicate adverse credit conditions northern trusts intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date and the likelihood that it will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the securitys amortized cost basis for each security meeting the requirements of northern trusts internal screening process an extensive review is conducted to determine if otti has occurred  while all securities are considered the process for identifying credit impairment within cra eligible mortgagebacked securities the security type for which northern trust has recognized all of the otti in 2014 incorporates an expected loss approach using discounted cash flows on the underlying collateral pools to evaluate whether an unrealized loss on cra mortgagebacked securities is otherthantemporary a calculation of the securitys present value is made using current pool data the current delinquency pipeline default rates and loan loss severities based on the historical performance of like collateral and northern trusts outlook for the housing market and the overall economy if the present value of the collateral pools was found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security a creditrelated otti loss would be recorded in earnings equal to the difference between the two amounts  impairments of cra mortgagebacked securities are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to us economic and housing market performance pool credit enhancement level year of origination and estimated credit quality of the collateral the factors used in estimating losses related to cra mortgagebacked securities vary by vintage of loan origination and collateral quality  as of december 31 2014 impairment estimates for cra mortgagebacked securities were developed using default and loss severity rates sourced from industry mortgage data ultimate recovery value of the securities was determined by applying default and severity rates against remaining collateral balances in the pools an expected loss amount was calculated by applying loss severity rates on defaulted amounts lastly book values were compared against collateral values net of expected losses in order to determine otti  the following describes northern trusts process for identifying credit impairment within nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities the security type for which northern trust has previously recognized the majority of its otti to determine if an unrealized loss on a nonagency residential mortgagebacked security is otherthantemporary economic models are used to perform cash flow analyses by developing multiple scenarios in order to create reasonable forecasts of the securitys future performance using available data including servicers loan charge off patterns prepayment speeds annualized default rates each securitys current delinquency pipeline the delinquency pipelines growth rate the roll rate from delinquency to default loan loss severities and historical performance of like collateral along with northern trusts outlook for the housing market and the overall economy if the present value of future cash flows projected as a result of this analysis is less than the current amortized cost of the

estimating losses on nonagency residential mortgagebacked securities vary by year of origination and type of collateral  as of december 31 2014 loss estimates for prime and 2nd lien collateral

note 7  allowance for credit losses    the allowance for credit losses which represents managements estimate of probable losses related to specific borrower relationships and inherent in the various loan and lease portfolios undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process northern trusts accounting policies related to the estimation of the allowance for credit losses and the charging off of loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are consistent across both loan and lease segments  in establishing the inherent portion of the allowance for credit losses northern trusts loan loss reserve committee assesses a common set of qualitative factors applicable to both the commercial and personal loan segments the risk characteristics underlying these qualitative factors and managements assessments as to the relative importance of a qualitative factor can vary between loan segments and between classes within loan segments factors evaluated include those related to external matters such as economic conditions and changes in collateral value and those related to internal matters such as changes in asset quality metrics and loan review activities in addition to the factors noted above risk characteristics such as portfolio delinquencies percentage of portfolio on the watch list and on nonperforming status and average borrower ratings are assessed in the determination of the inherent allowance  loantovalue levels are considered for collateralsecured loans and leases in both the personal and commercial segments borrower debt service coverage is evaluated in the personal segment and cash flow coverage is analyzed in the commercial segment  similar risk characteristics by type of exposure are analyzed when determining the allowance for undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit these qualitative factors together with historical loss rates serve as the basis for the allowance for credit losses  loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether an uncollectible loan is charged off or a specific allowance is established are based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount

counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions the fact that a credit exposure falls into one of these groups does not necessarily indicate that the credit has a higher than normal degree of credit risk these groups are banks and bank holding companies residential real estate and commercial real estate    banks and bank holding companies onbalance sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies both us and nonus consists primarily of interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell which totaled 160 billion and 199 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively and noninterestbearing demand balances maintained at correspondent banks which totaled 11 billion and 30 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively credit risk associated with us and nonus banks and bank holding companies deemed to be counterparties by credit risk management is managed by the counterparty risk management committee credit limits are established through a review process that includes an internally prepared financial analysis use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external ratings from rating agencies northern trust places deposits

residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines which generally require a loantocollateral value ratio of no more than 65 to 80 at inception revaluations of supporting collateral are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted collateral revaluations for mortgages are performed by independent third parties of the total 98 billion in residential real estate loans 30 billion were in the greater chicago area 22 billion were in florida and 16 billion were in california with the remainder distributed

and development loans extended to experienced investors well known to northern trust underwriting standards generally reflect conservative loantovalue ratios and debt service coverage requirements recourse to borrowers through guarantees is also commonly required commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of incomeproducing properties cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan these loans are primarily located in the illinois florida california texas and arizona markets construction acquisition and development loans

2014 and 2013 were 119 million and 156 million of unrecognized tax benefits respectively if recognized 2014 and 2013 net income would have increased by 88 million and 126 million respectively resulting in a decrease of those years effective income tax rates a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows                table 83 unrecognized

decreases of 37 million resulting in a remaining balance of 119 million at december 31 2014 compared to net decreases of 38 million resulting in a remaining balance of 156 million at december 31 2013 it is possible that changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could occur in the next 12 months due to changes in judgment related to recognition or measurement settlements with taxing authorities or expiration of statute of limitations management does not believe that future changes if any would have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of northern trust although they could have a material effect on operating results for a particular period  the provision for income tax in 2012 included a 124 million tax benefit in connection with the resolution of certain leveraged lease related matters  a provision for interest and penalties of 02 million net of tax was included in the provision for income taxes for the year ended december 31 2014 this compares to a benefit for recoveries of interest and penalties of 17 million net of tax for the year ended december 31 2013 as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the liability for the potential payment of interest and penalties totaled 102 million and 110 million net of tax respectively  pretax earnings of nonus subsidiaries are subject to us taxation when effectively repatriated northern trust

as of december 31 2014 the cumulative amount of undistributed pretax earnings in these subsidiaries was approximately 11 billion based on the current us federal income tax rate an additional deferred

investment strategy approach is employed for northern trusts us pension plan whereby a mix of us and nonus equities fixed income and alternative asset investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk this is accomplished by diversifying the portfolio across various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of return and among various issuers of securities to reduce principal risk northern trust utilizes an assetliability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and longterm objectives the process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions the financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the plans investment objectives risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming growth in plan liabilities over the long run                       133     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements

assets historical markets and longterm historical relationships between equities fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widelyaccepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the longrun current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined the longterm portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing the rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate based on this approach and the plans target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return on assets as of the plans december 31 2014 measurement date was

annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements    based on current knowledge after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals management does not believe that losses if any arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the corporation although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the corporations operating results for a particular period  under gaap i an event is probable if the future event or events are likely to occur ii an event is reasonably possible if the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely and iii an event is remote if the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight  for the reasons set out in this paragraph the outcome of some matters is inherently difficult to predict andor the range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated this may be the case in matters that i will be decided by a jury ii are in early stages iii involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class iv are subject to appeals or motions v involve significant factual issues to be resolved including with respect to the amount of damages vi do not specify the amount of damages sought or vii seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories accordingly the corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss fines or penalties if any related to each pending matter will be  in accordance with applicable accounting guidance the corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable when loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable the corporation does not record accruals no material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters  for a limited number of the matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability the corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss as of december 31 2014 the corporation has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses for these matters to be approximately 130 million in the aggregate this aggregate amount of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results will vary significantly from the current estimate  in certain other pending matters there may be a range of reasonably possible losses including reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts accrued that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above such matters are not included in the estimate of reasonably possible losses identified above  as previously disclosed a number of participants in northern trusts securities lending

obligated to indemnify visa for losses resulting from certain indemnified litigation relating to interchange fees and has been required to recognize at its estimated fair value in accordance with gaap a guarantee liability arising from such litigation that has not yet settled during 2007 northern trust recorded liabilities relating to visa indemnified litigation subsequently visa established an escrow account to cover the settlements of or judgments in indemnified litigation the fundings by visa of its escrow account resulted in reductions of northern trusts indemnification liability

indemnified litigation on january 14 2014 the trial court entered a final judgment order approving the settlement with the class plaintiffs which is subject to appeal a number of objectors have appealed from that order and more than 30 optout cases have been filed by merchants in various federal district courts  while the ultimate resolution of the indemnified litigation and the timing for

instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities these instruments include foreign exchange contracts interest rate contracts and credit default swap contracts  northern trusts primary risks associated with these instruments is the possibility that interest rates foreign exchange rates or credit spreads could change in an unanticipated manner resulting in higher costs or a loss in the underlying value of the instrument these risks are mitigated by establishing limits monitoring the level of actual positions taken against such established limits and monitoring the level of any interest rate sensitivity gaps created by such positions when establishing position limits market liquidity and volatility as well as experience in each market are taken into account  credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of northern trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses respectively on these instruments net of any cash collateral received or deposited the amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates foreign exchange rates or credit spreads fluctuate northern trusts risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities credit support annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of northern trusts counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with northern trust  northern trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between northern trust and the counterparty derivative assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were each reduced by 19 billion and 12 billion as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively as a result of master netting arrangements and similar agreements in place derivative assets and liabilities recorded at december 31 2014 also reflect reductions of 3158 million and 12 billion respectively as a result of cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties this compares with reductions of derivative assets and liabilities of 2107 million and 7677 million respectively at december 31 2013 additional cash collateral received from and deposited with                       143     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents

december 31 2013 were not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties northern trust centrally clears certain interest rate derivative instruments as required under title vii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act securities posted as collateral for these transactions totaled 274 million and 276 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively are not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and the counterparty receiving the securities as collateral does not have the right to repledge or sell the securities  certain master netting arrangements northern trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit riskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trusts credit rating falls below specified levels the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a liability position was 2995 million and 2573 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included 2729 million and 1970 million respectively posted against these liabilities resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at december 31 2014 and 2013 of 266 million and 603 million respectively accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of northern trust  foreign exchange contracts are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date at a specified rate of exchange foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients foreign exchange contracts are also used for trading purposes and risk management for risk management purposes northern trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to certain forecasted nonfunctional currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and net investments in nonus affiliates  interest rate contracts include swap and option contracts interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts northern trust enters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates interest rate option contracts may include caps floors collars and swaptions and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk typically in exchange for a fee northern trust enters into option contracts primarily as a seller of interest rate protection to clients

consolidated balance sheet other liabilities excluding derivative liabilities totaled 27941 million and 23384 million as of december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively  2 northern trust did not place any cash collateral with counterparties that was not offset in the consolidated balance sheet that could have been used to offset the net amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2014 and 2013    all of northern trusts securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repurchase agreements involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount in the event of a repurchase failure the cash or financial assets are available for offset all of northern trusts repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset under the master netting arrangement northern trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty in addition collateral held by northern trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty  derivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from and deposited with the transacting counterparty the basis for this view is that upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement the individual derivative receivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors effective in the second quarter of 2013 northern trust centrally clears certain                       149     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation

transactions are subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement which has the same rights of offset as described above    note 27  offbalancesheet financial instruments    commitments and letters of credit northern trust in the normal course of business enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the potential credit exposure should the instrument be fully drawn upon and the client default to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit northern trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities commitments and letters of credit consist of the following    legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements  standby letters of credit obligate northern trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients if under the contractual terms of the agreement the clients are unable to do so these instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments including commercial paper bond financing initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions northern trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants  commercial letters of credit are instruments issued by northern trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party the beneficiary to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade  the following table shows the contractual amounts of commitments and letters of credit                table 118

and at the direction of its clients northern trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the northern trust counterparty risk management committee in connection with these activities northern trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrowers failure to return securities when due should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted borrowers are required to fully collateralize securities received with cash or marketable securities as securities are loaned collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100 of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest the collateral is revalued on a daily basis the amount of securities loaned as of december 31 2014 and 2013 subject to indemnification was 981 billion and 827 billion respectively because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded related to these indemnifications  the bank is a participating member of various cash securities and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations such as the depository trust company in new york it participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own behalf as a result of its own activities a wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these                       150     2014 annual

subdivisions assetbacked securities commercial paper dollar placements and securities issued by the government national mortgage association  as a result of its participation in cash securities and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations the bank could be responsible for a pro rata share of certain creditrelated losses arising out of the clearing activities the method in which such losses would be shared by the clearing members is stipulated in each clearing organizations membership agreement credit exposure related to these agreements varies from day to day primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations the estimated credit exposure at december 31 2014 and 2013 was approximately 60 million and 73 million respectively based on the membership agreements and clearing volume for those days controls related to these clearing transactions are closely monitored by management to protect the assets of northern trust and its clients    note 28  variable interest entities    variable interest entities vies are defined within gaap as entities which either have a total equity investment that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder if any that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vies primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie    leveraged leases in leveraged leasing transactions northern trust

the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies  northern trusts maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the leveraged lease trust vies is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the carrying amounts of these investments which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated

projects which are vies is subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the vies  northern trusts

banking businesses the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both us and nonus source income and assets nonus source income and assets are not separately identified in northern trusts internal management reporting system however northern trust is required to disclose nonus activities based on the domicile of the customer due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trusts activities it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues expenses and assets between us and nonusdomiciled customers therefore certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues expenses and assets between us and nonus operations  for purposes of this disclosure all foreign exchange trading income has been

capital requirements administered by the federal bank regulatory authorities under these requirements banks must maintain specific ratios of total and tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and of tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets in order to be classified as wellcapitalized the regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not wellcapitalized and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a banks financial statements  as of december 31 2014 and 2013 the bank had capital ratios above the levels required for classification as a wellcapitalized institution and had not received any regulatory notification of a lower classification additionally northern trusts subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2014 and 2013 northern trusts nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum

december 31 2013 capital balances and ratios were calculated in accordance with basel i requirements    as of january 1 2015 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel iii are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the basel committee the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022                       156     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents notes to consolidated financial statements    under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank were required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and publicly disclose their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014 the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments the corporation provided to the federal reserve board regarding the corporations approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets did not result in the tier 1 or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as wellcapitalized  the uss implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital the corporation and the bank believe their capital strength balance sheets and business models leave them well positioned for the continued us implementation of basel iii    note 33  northern trust corporation corporation only    condensed financial information is presented
