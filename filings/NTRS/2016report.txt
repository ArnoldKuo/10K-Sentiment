distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirementsvarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approvalthe bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividendscapital planning and stress testingthe corporations capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve boards comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios including a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve board the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios in evaluating a capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance ccar rules provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny the corporations common stock dividend payout ratio was 353 in 2015the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in january 2015 as part of the federal reserve boards 2015 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporations plan due to a change in the capital planning schedule the corporation will submit its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve

payments and share repurchases by june 30 2016 the corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2016 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation

the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratiospursuant to the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as

differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratiobasel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0625 in 2016 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposuresliquidity standardsin addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organizations total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr is being phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a monthly basis daily calculation of the lcr will be required beginning in july 2016 additionally on november 24 2015 the federal reserve board proposed rules that would require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basisthe nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the nsfrthe enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporations board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trusts business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcrprompt corrective actionthe fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiaryas noted above in december 2011 the federal reserve board issued proposed rules to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 8table of contentstotal consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 early remediation requirements similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firms financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date and the final rules implementing section 165 indicate that the federal reserve board is continuing to consider the comments it received to the proposalrestrictions on transactions with affiliates and insidersas an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain covered transactions including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the banks capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of the banks capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms lengththe doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminatedthe restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions including the bank these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institutions total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these

business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may facethese risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10kmarket risksmarket volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions may affect our earnings negativelyour principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide such conditions also may affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negativelythe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board recently raised the target federal funds rate range interest rates generally remain near historical lows the low interest rate environment that has persisted since the 20072008 global financial crisis and that may persist in 2016 and beyond has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example since 2009 we have waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earningsa rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively if for example such a rise causes our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yield and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negativelyplease see market risk in the risk management

market risks we face      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 13table of contentschanges in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negativelythe monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operationsuncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earningsrisks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or continuing declines in oil prices and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negativelydeclines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negativelyour investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earningswe provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we facechanges in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negativelyin past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 14table of contentspercentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negativelyoperational risksmany types of operational risks can affect our earnings negativelywe regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope includefailures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattackshuman errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedurestheft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third partiesdefects or interruptions in computer or communications systemsbreakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operationsunsuccessful or difficult implementation of

reliable pricing from thirdparty vendorsnegative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations andexternal events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorismwhile we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate effectively these risks or we may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client typesand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk management program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adverselyfailures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in lossesany failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and our proprietary information and security breaches  including cyberattacks  could expose us to a risk of loss of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients proprietary information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activitiesthe third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 15table of contentsor attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breachesin recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients or other parties confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients or other parties business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results

our business the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we facewe use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of the risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business

technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and

allowance requirement which was partially offset by an increase to the allowance assigned to undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit the adoption of the new estimation methodology did not have a material impact on the estimated reserve for any other presented loan categories the decrease in 2014 was primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes overall allowance the evaluation of the specific component and the inherent component above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2333 million at december 31 2015 compared with 2959 million at the end of 2014 the allowance of 1938 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 058 at december 31 2015 down from a 2670 million allowance representing 084 of total loans and leases at december 31 2014 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 395 million and 289 million at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsprovision the provision for credit losses was a credit of 430 million and net chargeoffs totaled 195 million in 2015 this compares with a 60 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 180 million in 2014 and a 200 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 397 million in 2013impaired loansa loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2015 impaired loans totaled 1573 million and included 1171 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 2422 million at december 31 2014 which included 1513 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 31 million and 66 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loans market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1 million as of december 31 2015 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for

losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposuresthe allowance for credit losses consists of the following componentsspecific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateralinherent allowance as of december 31 2015 northern trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio the new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to current period and future periods the new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financefor periods prior to the methodology change the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors that incorporated managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and were reviewed quarterly by the loan loss reserve committeethe quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriateloans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffsmanagements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2015 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to periodadditionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated

accountingnorthern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periodsnorthern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assetsin determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2015 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 425 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 725in

mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 471 at

assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trusts rate of return assumption decreased from 725 for 2015 to 700 for 2016mortality table

is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categoriesphysical and financial collateral northern trusts primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trusts estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collaterals

well as various scenario analyses alco and mlrc establish and monitor guidelines based on measures such as soe seve var and notional position sizesinterest rate risk overviewinterest rate risk is the risk to earnings associated with the balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees related to the balance sheet changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest ratesthere are four commonly recognized types of interest rate riskrepricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilitiesyield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curvebasis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics andembedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changesinterest rate risk measurement reporting and analysisnorthern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 77table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssensitivity of earnings soethe modeling of soe incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptionsthe balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of which some recent increases are assumed to be temporary in nature and longterm fixed rate borrowings that upon maturity are replaced with overnight wholesale instrumentsprepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics

equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100

securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest to minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored limits are set on exposure with counterparties and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed it is northern trusts policy to take possession either directly or via third party custodians of securities purchased under agreements to resellg derivative financial instruments northern trust is a party to various derivative instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities these instruments include foreign exchange contracts interest rate contracts total return swaps and credit default swap contracts derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within other assets and other liabilities derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative in the consolidated statements of income depends on whether or not the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under gaap derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated statements of cash flows within the line item other operating activities net except for net investment hedges which are recorded within other investing activities netchanges in the fair value of clientrelated and trading derivative instruments which are not designated hedges under gaap are recognized currently in either foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in other operating income certain derivative instruments used by northern trust to manage risk are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value cash flow or net investment hedgesderivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit northern trusts exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in income for substantially all fair value hedges northern trust applies the shortcut method of accounting available under gaap which assumes there is no ineffectiveness in a hedge as a result changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are equal to the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative and are reflected in the same line item for fair value hedges that do not qualify for the shortcut method of accounting northern trust utilizes regression analysis a longhaul method of      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 91table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsaccounting in assessing whether these hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter ineffectiveness resulting from fair value hedges is recorded in either interest income or interest expensederivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows

component of stockholders equity and there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item balances in aoci are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings northern trust applies the shortcut method of accounting for cash flow hedges of certain available for sale investment securities for cash flow hedges of certain other available for sale investment securities and forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions northern trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis which limits hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges of available for sale investment securities to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method for cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched effectiveness is assessed using the dollaroffset method and any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method any ineffectiveness is recognized currently in earningsforeign exchange contracts and qualifying nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to minimize northern trusts exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in nonus branches and subsidiaries the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument is recognized in aoci consistent with the related translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment for net investment hedges all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis to minimize the risk of hedge ineffectiveness to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched any ineffectiveness is measured using the hypothetical derivative method ineffectiveness resulting from net investment hedges is recorded in other operating income amounts recorded in aoci are reclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a nonus branch or subsidiaryfair value cash flow and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous with the transaction the formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and hedged items included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking such hedges the nature of the risk being hedged a description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis as well as the method that will be used to measure hedge ineffectiveness for hedges that do not qualify for the shortcut or the critical terms match methods of accounting a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective matures is terminated or sold if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur or if northern trust removes the derivatives hedge designation subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income for discontinued cash flow hedges the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in aoci and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring for discontinued fair value hedges the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value previous adjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged itemh loans and leases loans and leases are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates loans and leases are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment segment and by class segment is defined as the level at which management develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses northern trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal a class of loans and leases is a subset of a segment the components of which has similar risk characteristics measurement attributes or risk monitoring methods the classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional commercial real estate lease financing net nonus and other the classes within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate private client and otherloan classification loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value loan commitments for residential real estate loans that will be classified as held for sale at the time of funding and which have an interest rate lock are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with subsequent gains or losses recognized in other operating income unrealized gains on these loan commitments are reported as other assets with unrealized losses reported as other liabilities other undrawn commitments relating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in other liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees with an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated probable losses     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 92table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsrecognition of income interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless in the opinion of management there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement or interest or principal is more than 90 days contractually past due and the loan is not wellsecured and in the process of collection loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due for disclosure purposes loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current at the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless in the opinion of management collectability of principal is not in doubt managements assessment of indicators of loan and lease collectability and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition do not meaningfully vary between loan and lease classes nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and in accordance with regulatory guidance relate primarily to expected payment performance loans are eligible to be returned to performing status when i no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or ii the loan has otherwise become wellsecured possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt including accrued interest in full and is in the process of collection through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future a loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six payment periods by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms and northern trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time additionally a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status provided there was a welldocumented credit evaluation of the borrowers financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six payment periods under the revised termsimpaired loans a loan is considered to be impaired when based on current information and events management determines that it is probable that northern trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes including the formal review of past due and watch list credits payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases particularly those within the residential real estate private client and personalother classes other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and institutional nonus lease financing and commercialother classes relate to the borrowers ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the assessment of future cash flows including consideration of collateral value market value and other factors a loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession by northern trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring tdr all tdrs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring in subsequent years a tdr may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least six payment periods a loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the six payment periods performance requirement however it will remain reported as impaired impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the loans observable market value if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan based on the certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1000000 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards northern trusts accounting policies for material impaired loans is consistent across all classes of loans and leasespremiums and discounts premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan certain direct origination costs and fees are netted deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loans yielddirect financing and leverage leases unearned lease income from direct financing and leveraged leases is recognized using the interest method this method provides a constant rate of return on the unrecovered investment over the life of the lease the rate of return and the allocation of income over the lease term are recalculated from the inception of the lease if during the lease term assumptions regarding the amount or timing of estimated cash flows change lease residual values are established at the inception of the lease based on inhouse valuations and market analyses provided by outside parties lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otti a decline in the estimated residual value of a leased asset determined to be otherthantemporary would be recorded in the period in which the decline is identified as a reduction of interest income     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 93table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsi allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components specific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral inherent allowance as of december 31 2015 northern trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio the new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to current period and future periods the new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the quantitative inherent allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework where management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology to compute an adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolioas of december 31 2014 the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors which incorporated managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristicsresults under both methods were reviewed quarterly by northern trusts loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management reporting segment management and corporate finance loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance northern trusts policies relative to the chargingoff of uncollectible loans and leases are consistent across both loan and lease segments determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established are based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined to be appropriate through the above processes actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater of less than actual net chargeoffsnorthern trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet activity using a consistent methodologyas of december 31 2015 for purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters the exposure at default includes an estimated drawdown of unused credit based on a credit conversion factor the proportionate amount of the quantitative methodology calculation after any required adjustment in the qualitative framework results in the required allowance for undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date as of december 31 2014 for purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit management used conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that would be funded factors based on historical loss experience and specific risk characteristics of the loan product were utilized to calculate inherent losses related to undrawn commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date       the portion of the allowance assigned to loans and leases is reported as a contra asset directly following loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets the portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsj standby letters of credit fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in other operating income using the straightline method over the lives of the underlying agreements northern trusts recorded other liability for standby      2015 annual

straightline basis purchased software and allowable internal costs including compensation relating to software developed for internal use are capitalized software is amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets generally ranging from 3 to 10 yearsgoodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverablen trust investment and other servicing fees trust investment and other servicing fees are recorded on the accrual basis over the period in which the service is provided fees are a function of the market value of assets custodied managed and serviced the volume of transactions securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered as set forth in the underlying client agreement this revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumeso client security settlement receivables these receivables result from custody client withdrawals from shortterm investment funds that settle on the following business day as well as custody client security sales executed under contractual settlement date accounting that have not yet settled northern trust advances cash to the client on the date of either client withdrawal or trade execution and awaits collection from either the shortterm investment funds or via the settled tradep income taxes northern trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes the objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities the measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax ratestax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities only tax positions that are considered morelikelythannot to be sustained are recorded in the consolidated financial statements northern trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxesq cash flow statements cash and cash equivalents have been defined as cash and due from banksr pension and other postretirement benefits northern trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets funded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other assets and unfunded pension and postretirement benefits are reported in other liabilities plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at december 31 plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing observable market prices the projected benefit obligations are determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate pension costs are recognized ratably over the estimated working lifetime of eligible participants     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 95table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementss sharebased compensation plans northern trust recognizes as compensation expense the grantdate fair value of stock and stock unit awards and other sharebased compensation granted to employees within the consolidated statements of income the fair values of stock and stock unit awards including performance stock unit awards and director awards are based on the closing price of the corporations stock on the date of grant the fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the model utilizes weightedaverage assumptions regarding the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding expected term based primarily on the historical exercise behavior attributable to previous option grants the estimated yield from dividends paid on the corporations stock over the expected term of the options the historical volatility of northern trusts stock price and the implied volatility of traded options on northern trust stock and a risk free interest rate based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the options grantedcompensation expense for sharebased award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period are recognized on a straightline basis over the requisite service period for the entire award northern trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of sharebased compensation expense as historical forfeitures have not been significant sharebased compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur dividend equivalents are paid on stock units that have been granted but not yet vested cash flows resulting from the realization of tax deductions from the exercise of stock options in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits are classified as financing cash flowst net income per common share basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net incomeloss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common shares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common share equivalents calculated for stock options and restricted stock outstanding using the treasury stock method in a period of a net loss diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common sharenorthern trust has issued certain restricted stock awards which are unvested sharebased payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents these restricted shares are considered participating securities accordingly northern trust calculates net income applicable to common stock using the twoclass method whereby net income is allocated between common stock and participating securitiesnote 2  recent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards

transaction between market participants on the measurement datefair value hierarchy the following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs levels 1 2 and 3 used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by northern trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available gaap requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation northern trusts policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred no transfers between fair value levels occurred during the years ended december 31 2015 or 2014level 1  quoted active market prices for identical assets or liabilities northern trusts level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in us treasury securitieslevel 2  observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets northern trusts level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and thirdparty prices if a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed predetermined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset types characteristics the exception is researched and if the price is not able to be validated an alternate pricing vendor is utilized consistent with northern trusts pricing source hierarchy as of december 31 2015 northern trusts available for sale securities portfolio included 1044 level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of 261 billion all 1044 securities were valued by external pricing vendors as of december 31 2014 northern trusts available for sale securities portfolio included 881 level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of 250 billion all 881 securities were valued by external pricing vendors trading account securities which totaled 12 million and 47 million as of december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively were all valued using external pricing vendors     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 97table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsnorthern trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities on a daily basis periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous days reported prices for each security predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor quarterly northern trust reviews documentation from thirdparty pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by northern trust to each security classification are appropriate annually valuation inputs used within thirdparty pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs used to comparable market data including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications comprising significant portions of the portfoliolevel 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts credit spreads default probabilities and recovery rates for credit default swap contracts interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts northern trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments factors considered include the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered materiallevel 3  valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace northern trusts level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased in 2008 from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities for which trading is limited and market prices are generally unavailable northern trust developed and maintains a pricing model that discounts estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model include the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities and the applicable discount rates significant increases decreases in the estimated remaining lives or the discount rates in isolation would result in a slightly lower higher fair value measurement northern trusts level 3 liabilities consisted of a swap that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 10 million shares of visa inc class b common stock visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust pursuant to the swap northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swap also requires periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swap is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trusts own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see visa class b common shares under note 24 contingent liabilities for further informationnorthern trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate however the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets and liabilities could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair valuesmanagement of various businesses and departments of northern trust including corporate market risk credit risk management corporate finance campis and wealth management reviews valuation methods and models for level 3 assets and liabilities fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability management of the appropriate business or department reviews assumed inputs especially when unobservable in the marketplace in order to substantiate their use in each fair value measurement when appropriate management reviews forecasts used in the valuation process in light of other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between current and previous fair value measurements in certain circumstances third party information is used to support the fair value measurements if certain third party information seems inconsistent with consensus views a review of the information is performed by management of the respective business or department to conclude as to the appropriate fair value of the asset or liability     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 98table of

both loan and lease segmentsloans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether an uncollectible loan is charged off or a specific allowance is established are based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of lossas

investment strategy approach is employed for northern trusts us pension plan whereby a mix of us and nonus equities fixed income and alternative asset investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk this is accomplished by diversifying the portfolio across various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of return and among various issuers of securities to reduce principal risk northern trust utilizes an assetliability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and longterm objectives the process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions the financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the plans investment objectives risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming growth in plan liabilities over the long runthe target allocation of plan assets since may 2014 by major asset category is 20 us equities 15 nonus equities 45 long duration fixed income securities and 20 alternative investments split among private equity funds 5 hedge funds 5 real estate 5 and global listed infrastructure 5 equity investments include common stocks that are listed on an exchange and

commingled funds that invest in a diversified blend of longer duration fixed income securities alternative investments including private equity hedge funds real estate and global infrastructure are used judiciously to enhance longterm returns while improving portfolio diversification private equity assets consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships that invest in individual companies in the form of nonpublic equity or nonpublic debt positions direct or coinvestment in nonpublic stock by the plan is prohibited the plans private equity investments are limited to 20 of the total limited partnership and the maximum allowable loss cannot exceed the commitment amount the plan holds two investments in a hedge fund of funds which invests either directly or indirectly in a diversified portfolio of funds or other pooled investment vehiclesinvestment in real estate is designed to provide stable income returns and added diversification based upon the historical low correlation between real estate and equity or fixed income investments the plans real estate assets consist of one collective index fund that invests in a diversified portfolio of global real estate investments primarily equity securitiesthough not a primary strategy for meeting the plans objectives derivatives may be used from time to time depending on the nature of the asset class to which they relate to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner to hedge foreign currency exposure or interest rate risk or to alter the duration of a portfolio there were no derivatives held by the plan at december 31 2015 or 2014investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly liability measurements periodic assetliability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews standards used to evaluate the plans investment manager performance include but are not limited to the achievement of objectives operation within guidelines and policy and comparison

plan in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets and longterm historical relationships between equities fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widelyaccepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the longrun current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined the longterm portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing the rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate based on this approach and the plans target asset allocation the expected longterm rate of return

liability or where there is no accrued liability the corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss as of december 31 2015 the corporation has estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses for these matters to be approximately 125 million in the aggregate this aggregate amount of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results will vary

party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities these instruments include foreign exchange contracts interest rate contracts total return swap contracts and credit default swap contractsnorthern trusts primary risks associated with these instruments is the possibility that interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices or credit spreads could change in an unanticipated manner resulting in higher costs or a loss in the underlying value of the instrument these risks are mitigated by establishing limits monitoring the level of actual positions taken against such established limits and monitoring the level of any interest rate sensitivity gaps created by such positions when establishing position limits market liquidity and volatility as well as experience in each market are taken into accountcredit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of northern trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses respectively on these instruments net of any cash collateral received or deposited the amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices or credit spreads fluctuate northern trusts risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities credit support annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of northern trusts counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with northern trustnorthern trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between northern trust and the counterparty derivative assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were each reduced by 13 billion and 19 billion as of december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively as a result of master netting arrangements and similar agreements in place derivative assets and liabilities recorded at december 31 2015 also reflect reductions of 3228 million and 4403 million respectively as a result of cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties this compares with reductions of derivative assets and liabilities of 3158 million and 12 billion respectively at december 31 2014 additional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling 311 million and 273 million respectively as of december 31 2015 and 196 million and 1532 million respectively as of december 31 2014 were not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties northern trust centrally clears certain interest rate derivative instruments as required under title vii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act securities posted as collateral for these transactions totaled 154 million and 274 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively are not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and the counterparty receiving the securities as collateral does not have the right to repledge or sell the securitiescertain master netting arrangements northern trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit riskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event northern trusts credit rating falls below specified levels the aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit riskrelated contingent features that were in a liability position was 5532 million and 2995 million at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included 1630 million and 2729 million respectively posted against these liabilities resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at december 31 2015 and 2014 of 3902 million and 266 million respectively accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of northern trustforeign exchange contracts are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date at a

denominated assets and liabilities and net investments in nonus affiliatesinterest rate contracts include swap and option contracts interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and

contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates interest rate option contracts may include caps floors collars and swaptions and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk typically in exchange for a fee northern trust enters into option contracts primarily as a seller of interest rate protection to clients northern trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an unfavorable change in interest rates this assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position with an outside counterparty northern trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management purposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest ratesclientrelated and trading derivative instruments approximately 97 of northern trusts derivatives outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014 measured on a notional value basis relate to clientrelated and trading activities these activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services

financial assets are available for offset all of northern trusts repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset under the master netting arrangement northern trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty in addition collateral held by northern trust can be offset against receivables from that counterpartyderivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from and deposited with the transacting counterparty the basis for this view is that upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement the individual derivative      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 148table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsreceivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors effective in the second quarter of 2013 northern trust centrally

failure to return securities when due should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted borrowers are required to fully collateralize securities received

would be shared by the clearing members is stipulated in each clearing organizations membership agreement credit exposure related to these agreements varies from day to day primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations the estimated credit exposure at december 31 2015 and 2014 was approximately 58 million and 60 million respectively based

finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder if any that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vies primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vieleveraged leases in leveraged leasing transactions northern trust acts as lessor of the

the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property as a result northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the viesnorthern trusts maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with the leveraged lease trust vies is limited to the carrying amounts of its leveraged lease investments as of december 31 2015 and 2014 the carrying amounts of these investments which are included in loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets were 3894 million

subject to the performance of their underlying investment and their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments this power is held by the general partners and managing members who exercise full and exclusive control of the operations of the viesnorthern trusts maximum exposure to loss as a result of

funds to 100 the contributions which were recorded to other operating expense in the consolidated statements of income resulted in a pretax charge of 458 million under gaap the contributions noted above are deemed to reflect northern trusts implicit interest in the credit risk of the funds which must be considered when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of the funds in determining whether northern trust is the primary beneficiary of the funds northern trust used an expected loss calculation based on the characteristics of the underlying investments in the funds to estimate the expected losses related to interest rate and credit risk and also considered the relative rights and obligations of each of the applicable variable interest holders upon consideration of this analysis northern trust determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of the funds as interest rate risk was determined to be the primary driver of expected losses within such funds similarly based on its analysis including consideration of the contributions noted above northern trust has also determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any other investment funds for which it serves as asset manager under gaap accordingly northern trust is not required to consolidate the funds or any other investment funds for which it serves as asset manager within its consolidated balance sheets any potential future support of the funds will be at the discretion of northern trust after an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances and with careful consideration as to

capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not wellcapitalized and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a banks financial statementsas of december 31 2015

supplementary leverage ratio effective january 1 2018 the corporation will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percentas of january 1 2015 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel iii are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the basel committee the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022under the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank were required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and publicly disclose their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 156table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsquarter of 2014 the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments the corporation provided to the federal reserve board regarding the corporations approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets did not result in the tier 1 or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as wellcapitalizedthe uss implementation of basel iii has increased the

trusts counterparty risk management committee which has credit authority for exposure to all nonus banks and approves credit limits this process includes financial analysis of the nonus banks use of an internal risk rating system and consideration of external market indicators each counterparty is reviewed at least annually and potentially more frequently based on deteriorating credit
