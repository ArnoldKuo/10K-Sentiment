supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators  a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds the corporation believes that it has taken the necessary actions to comply with these requirements of federal law  nonus regulation  the increasingly important activities of the corporations subsidiaries outside the us are subject to regulation and supervision by a number of nonus regulatory agencies subsidiaries conducting banking fund administration and asset servicing businesses in the united kingdom for example are subject to regulation by and supervision of the financial services authority fsa and are authorized to conduct such activities pursuant to the uk financial services and markets act of 2000 the fsa exercises broad supervisory and disciplinary powers that include the power to temporarily or permanently revoke authorization to conduct a regulated business upon breach of the relevant regulations suspend registered employees and impose censures and fines on both regulated businesses and their registered employees the nonus subsidiaries of the corporation and branches of the bank outside the us are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which they operate additionally the corporations subsidiary banks located outside the us are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate as of december 31 2012 each of the corporations nonus banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements as is the case in the us european regulatory authorities are introducing regulatory change in a wide variety of areas for example new regulations issued by european regulators through the undertaking for

authorities are also putting forward proposals through the markets in financial instruments directive 2 european market infrastructure regulation and market abuse regulation proposals which deal with

conditions heightened prudential standards may be applied on a graduated basis using the factors included in the fsoc systemic determination standards on december 20 2011 the federal reserve board requested public comments on proposed rules that would implement the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under section 165 of the doddfrank act and the early remediation requirements established under section 166 of the doddfrank act in addition covered companies including the corporation must prepare and file credit exposure reports and limit their aggregate credit exposures broadly defined to any unaffiliated company to 25 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the covered company  resolution planning as required by the doddfrank act the federal reserve

new standards prohibit the corporations subsidiaries from making a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrowers ability to repay limit the total points and fees that the corporations subsidiaries andor a mortgage broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3 of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices also the doddfrank act in conjunction with the federal reserve boards final rule on loan originator compensation prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and steering consumers to loans not in their interest because it will result in greater compensation for a loan originator these standards will result in a myriad of new system pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses  proprietary trading and certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds the doddfrank act adopts the socalled volcker rule which subject to a twoyear transition period and certain exceptions became effective on july 21 2012 and prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading which is defined as engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in securities or other instruments as determined by federal regulators certain forms of proprietary trading may qualify as permitted activities and thus not be subject to

will apply to banking entities including the corporation the bank and their affiliates unless an exception applies in october 2011 the occ federal reserve board the fdic and the sec in consultation with the commodity futures trading commission cftc jointly released a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the volcker rule limitations of the doddfrank act to date no final rule has been issued in light of the complexity of the proposed regulation and the substantial number of comments submitted the corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the volcker rule on its business until final rules are adopted  swaps and other derivatives title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be pushed out of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a major swap participant or a swap dealer the cftc sec and other us regulators have adopted and are still in the process of adopting regulations to implement title vii it is anticipated that this rulemaking process will further clarify among other things reporting and recordkeeping obligations margin and capital requirements the scope of registration requirements and what swaps are required to be centrally cleared and exchangetraded rules will also be issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities  consumer financial protection the doddfrank act establishes a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers for banking organizations with assets of 10 billion or more including the bank the cfpb has exclusive rule making and examination and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb this new federal and state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services with potentially significant increases in compliance costs  incentive compensation arrangements the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions on april 14 2011 federal regulators including the fdic the federal reserve board and the sec issued a proposed rule which among other things would require certain executive officers of covered financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation to defer at least 50 of their annual incentivebased compensation for a minimum of three years no final rule has been issued to date  the requirements of the doddfrank act will be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several months or years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporations operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporations banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporations business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporations business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements  holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia  under the fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions default means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution  the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that own the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with    6    table of contents  the sourceofstrength requirements the term source of financial strength is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress the doddfrank act statutory requirements became effective on july 21 2011 although the appropriate federal banking agencies were required by the doddfrank act to jointly adopt implementing regulations by july 21 2011 to date no final regulations have been adopted  this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions  payment of dividends  the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the principal source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend primarily on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements  the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding companys financial health such as by borrowing  various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval  the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as described below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends  bank holding companies domiciled in the us with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation must submit annual capital plans to the federal reserve board for review under the final rule the federal reserve board annually evaluates institutions capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and their plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases the federal reserve board will approve dividend increases or other capital distributions only for companies whose capital plans receive a nonobjection by supervisors and are able to demonstrate sufficient financial strength to operate as successful financial intermediaries under stressed macroeconomic and financial market scenarios after making the desired capital distributions the federal reserve board annually issues instructions outlining the information it is seeking from the covered firms including the corporation and the evaluation the federal reserve board will do of the capital plans the level of detail and analysis expected in each institutions capital plan varies based on the companys size complexity risk profile and scope of operations in january 2012 the corporation submitted its first capital plan to the federal reserve board and its second capital plan was submitted on january 7 2013    7    table of contents capital adequacy requirements  the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institutions financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factors  the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation the current riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for core banks including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005  basel i  under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least three percent of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets  the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdic insured depository institutions are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as wellcapitalized are provided in the following chart                        riskbased and leverage ratios as ofdecember 31 2012        tier 1capital     totalcapital     leverageratio     northern trust corporation     128       143       82     the northern trust company     119

corporation also is subject to the basel ii framework for riskbased capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations as a result the corporation and the bank will be required to use the advanced approaches under basel ii for calculating riskbased capital related to credit risk and operational risk instead of the methodology reflected in the regulations effective prior to adoption of basel ii the rules also require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy    8    table of contents the corporation has for several years been preparing to comply with the advanced approaches of the basel ii framework in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation was required to adopt and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculated capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010  the corporation is also addressing issues related to implementation timing differences between the us and other jurisdictions to ensure that the corporation and its depository institution subsidiaries comply with regulatory requirements and expectations in all jurisdictions where they operate the corporations uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements  basel iii  on december 16 2010 the basel committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation known as basel iii the basel iii calibration and phasein arrangements were previously endorsed by the seoul g20 leaders summit in november 2010 and will be subject to individual adoption by member nations including the us under these standards when fully phasedin on january 1 2019 banking institutions will be required to satisfy three riskbased capital ratios  a common equity tier 1 ratio of at least 70 inclusive of 45 minimum common equity tier 1 ratio net of regulatory deductions and the new 25 capital conservation buffer of common equity to riskweighted assets  a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 85 inclusive of the 25 capital conservation buffer and  a total capital ratio of at least 105 inclusive of the 25 capital conservation buffer  the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall the basel committee also announced that a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of common equity or other lossabsorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer during periods of excess credit growth  basel i and basel ii do not include a leverage requirement as an international standard however basel iii introduces a nonrisk adjusted tier 1 leverage ratio of 3 based on a measure of total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards  the basel committee had initially planned for member nations to begin implementing the basel iii requirements by january 1 2013 with full implementation by january 1 2019 on november 9 2012 us regulators announced that implementation of basel iiis first requirements would be delayed until an undetermined future date the regulators made no indication that any other future regulatory phasein dates would be delayed  on november 4 2011 the basel committee issued its final rule setting forth proposals to apply a new common equity tier 1 surcharge to certain designated global systemically important banks gsibs gsibs subject to the surcharge are identified by application of a quantitative indicatorbased approach for evaluating systemic risk that weights both categories and indicators of size substitutability interconnectedness crossjurisdictional activity and complexity on november 1 2012 using the basel committees methodology the financial stability board fsb and the basel committee identified 28 financial institutions determined to be gsibs the group of gsibs is updated annually and published by the fsb each november at this time the corporation has not been designated as a gsib the gsibs equity surcharge provisions like the rest of basel iii are subject to interpretation and implementation by us regulatory authorities  under the doddfrank act for sifis including the corporation the federal reserve board may increase the capital buffer the purpose of these new capital requirements is to ensure financial institutions are better capitalized to withstand periods of unfavorable financial and economic conditions the doddfrank act also requires the establishment of more stringent prudential standards by requiring the federal banking agencies to adopt capital and liquidity requirements which address the risks that the activities of an institution pose to the institution and the public and private stakeholders including risks arising from certain enumerated activities in particular the doddfrank act excludes trust preferred securities issued on or after may 19 2010 from tier 1 capital for depository institution holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than 15 billion at december 31 2009 trust preferred securities issued before may 19 2010 will be phasedout of tier 1 capital over a threeyear period    9    table of contents on june 7 2012 the board of governors of the federal reserve in conjunction with the office of the comptroller of the currency and the fdic published three notices of proposed rulemaking related to basel iii the proposed rules include two calculation methods a standardized approach applicable to all depository institutions bank holding companies with consolidated assets of 500 million or more and savings and loan holding companies and an advanced approach generally applicable only to the largest most internationally active banking organizations the corporation and bank will calculate their capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches under the proposed rules the corporation and the bank must maintain capital levels that exceed the adequately capitalized minimum ratios under the most constraining of the two approaches for advanced approaches institutions the proposed rules state that for the capital conservation buffer any countercyclical capital buffer applied and any other capital surcharges that are applied a depository institutions or bank holding companys capital adequacy will be assessed using the advanced approaches  the ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and the bank is currently being reviewed and will depend on a number of factors including the rulemaking and implementation by the us banking regulators the corporation cannot determine the ultimate effect that potential legislation or subsequent regulations if enacted would have upon the corporations earnings or financial position in addition significant questions remain as to how the capital and liquidity mandates of the doddfrank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii however as the corporation currently understands basel iii it believes its capital strength balance sheet and business model leave it well positioned for basel iii  prompt corrective action  under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized us depository institutions us depository institutions are assigned one of five capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2012 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized  examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies  a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist including without limitation the fact that the banking institution            is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized            fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so            fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan            materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan or            fails to submit an acceptable resolution plan    10    table of contents the fdic may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institutions regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions  restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders  fdicinsured banks including the corporations bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain covered transactions including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending banks capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending banks capital stock and surplus these restrictions other than the 10 of capital limit on covered transactions with any one affiliate are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms length  the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that permits a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminated  the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institutions total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders  antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control  under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus clients financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institutions compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations    11    table of contents the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities  many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporations nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions additionally neither the company nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries have engaged in activities which are sanctionable under the iran sanctions act or the comprehensive iran sanctions accountability and divestment act cisada engaged in transactions with the government iran or persons whose assets are frozen pursuant to executive orders dealing with terrorism or weapons of mass destruction proliferation or engaged in the transfer of goods technology or services to iran that are likely to be used for human rights abuses against the iranian people  deposit insurance and assessments  fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institutions deposit insurance assessment is based on that institutions risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institutions risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators the institutions capital levels and other risk measures  the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits federal deposit insurance for the full net amount of deposits in noninterest bearing transaction accounts expired on december 31 2012 for all insured banks  the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 where it remains today the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act  the fdics rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the old assessment base the final rules assessment rates are lower than the older rates which achieves the fdics goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the rule adopts a scorecard assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the final rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the old system  continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank  interstate banking and branching  the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding companys home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged    12    table of contents in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state  community reinvestment act  the corporations banking subsidiaries are subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a banks record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a banks performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank in its most recent cra examination received an outstanding cra rating from its regulator  in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry as of december 31 2012 the bank is not a party to any such agreements  privacy and security  federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring banks to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain rules with respect to the disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and requiring notification of security breaches  consumer laws and regulations  in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporations banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks  many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws  money market mutual fund regulation  after the sec announced on august 28 2012 that it would not solicit public comment on potential money market mutual funds mmmf structural reforms on november 3 2012 the
