their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios the capital plan

requirementsthe regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institutions financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factorsthe riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2016 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulatorsunder the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratiospursuant to the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy     2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 7table of contentsthe riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the

beginning in 2018 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation and the bank must comply with a supplementary leverage ratio under the supplementary leverage ratio rule advanced approaches institutions will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered wellcapitalized under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratiobasel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 125 in 2017 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 and the federal reserve board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12month phasein of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subjectliquidity standardsin addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organizations total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr has been phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a daily basis daily calculation of the lcr has been required since july 2016 additionally on december 19 2016 the federal reserve board finalized rules that will require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basis these disclosure rules will be phased in from april 2017 through october 2018the nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by    8  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsjanuary 1 2018 the federal reserve board issued a proposal on may 3 2016 to implement the nsfr but has not adopted a final rulethe enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporations board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trusts business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile the board of directors has approved a liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcrprompt corrective actionthe fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take appropriate action against a parent bank holding company such as the corporation based on the undercapitalized status of any banking subsidiary in certain instances the corporation would be required to guarantee the performance of the capital restoration plan for its undercapitalized banking subsidiaryas noted above the federal reserve board has issued proposed rules to implement certain early remediation requirements applicable to us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more as required under section 166 of the doddfrank act similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firms financial condition deteriorates no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to daterestrictions on transactions with affiliates and insidersas an insured depository institution the bank is subject to restrictions which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the corporation as the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the

between the bank and its financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms lengththe doddfrank act generally enhanced the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted the bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminatedthe restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve

1a  risk factorsin the normal course of our business activities we are exposed to a variety of risks the following discussion sets forth the risk factors that we have identified as being most significant to northern trust although we discuss these risk factors primarily in the context of their potential effects on our business financial condition or results of operations you should understand that these effects can have further negative implications such as reducing the price of our common stock and other securities reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers which may affect adversely our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so further additional risks beyond those discussed below elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k or in other of our reports filed with or furnished to the sec also could affect us adversely we cannot assure you that the risk factors herein or elsewhere in our other reports address all potential risks that we may facethese risk factors also serve to describe factors which may cause our results to differ materially from those described in forwardlooking statements included herein or in other documents or statements that make reference to this annual report on form 10k forwardlooking statements and other factors that may affect future results are discussed under forwardlooking statements included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10kmarket risksmarket volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions may affect our earnings negativelyour principal operational focus is on feebased business which is distinct from commercial banking institutions that earn most of their revenues from loans and other traditional interestgenerating products and services fees for many of our products and services are based on the market value of assets under management custody or administration the volume of transactions processed securities lending volume and spreads and fees for other services rendered all of which may be impacted negatively by market volatility andor a downturn in economic conditions for example downturns in equity markets and decreases in the value of debtrelated investments resulting from market disruption illiquidity or other factors have historically reduced the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others which generally impacted our earnings negatively market volatility andor weak economic conditions also may affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for certain products and services that we provide such conditions also may affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which would reduce our earnings changes in interest rates can affect our earnings negativelythe direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings although the federal reserve board has raised the target federal funds rate range in recent years thus far such increases have been measured and interest rates generally remain near historical lows the low interest rate environment that has persisted since the 20072008 global financial crisis has had and may continue to have a negative impact on our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a continued low interest rate environment also may have a negative impact on our fees earned on certain of our products for example we have waived in recent years and may waive in the future certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to shortterm interest rate levels low net interest margins and fee waivers each negatively impact our earningsa rise in interest rates also may affect us negatively if for example such a rise causes our clients to transfer funds into investments with higher rates of return resulting in decreased deposit levels and higher fund or account redemptions our borrowers to experience difficulties in making higher interest payments resulting in increased credit costs provisions for loan and lease losses and chargeoffs reduced bond and fixed income fund liquidity resulting in lower performance yield and fees a decline in the value of securities held in our portfolio of investment securities resulting in decreased levels of capital and liquidity or higher funding costs further although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of interest rate risks if our assumptions about any number of variables are incorrect these policies and procedures to mitigate risk may be ineffective which could impact earnings negativelyplease see market risk in the risk management section included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of

in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies may reduce our earnings and affect our growth prospects negativelythe monetary and other policies of us and international governments agencies and regulatory bodies have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance for example the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing which are important factors in our earnings the actions of the federal reserve board or other regulatory authorities also may reduce the value of financial instruments we hold further their policies can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available which may increase the risk that borrowers fail to repay their loans from us changes in monetary and other governmental policies are beyond our control and can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any such changes would have upon our business financial condition or results of operationsuncertainty about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe including the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earningsrisks and concerns about the financial stability of various regions or countries across the globe could have a detrimental impact on economic and market conditions in these or other markets across the world foreign market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence of and default on consumer debt and home prices economic challenges faced in various foreign markets including negative interest rates in some jurisdictions or continuing pressure on oil prices and any disruptions related to such challenges may impact our earnings negativelythe ultimate impact on us of the united kingdoms referendum regarding whether to remain part of the europeanunion remains uncertainin june 2016 the united kingdom uk held a referendum in which voters approved a departure from the european union the eu commonly referred to as brexit the ultimate impact of brexit on the corporation and the bank remains uncertain and will depend on the terms of withdrawal and the postbrexit relationships that the uk will negotiate with the eu and other noneu nations increased market volatility and further global economic deterioration resulting from brexit or concern about brexit could have significant adverse effects on our businesses financial condition and results of operations the volatility in the exchange rate for the british pound has increased since the announcement of brexit which has had and may continue to have a negative effect on our results of operations additionally certain of our eu operations are conducted through a uk branch of the bank and other of our subsidiaries located in the uk if our uk subsidiaries are not able to retain their eu financial services passport which permits crossborder services and activities throughout the single eu market without needing to obtain local authorizations we may incur costs to establish one or more subsidiaries in other eu member states and move operations and personnel accordingly further during any such transition we may be faced with greater operational risk and client concern with respect to our ability to maintain a high level of service delivery particularly relative to those of our competitors with subsidiaries in other eu member states facing a lesser degree of cost or disruption if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordinglydeclines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can affect us negativelyour investment securities portfolio represents a greater proportion and our loan and lease portfolios represent a smaller proportion of our total consolidated assets in comparison to many other financial institutions the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio which is generally determined based upon market values available from thirdparty sources may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption affected negatively the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio negatively impact our levels of capital and liquidity further to the extent that we experience unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities from declines in securities values that management determines to be other than temporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination although we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of market risks including hedgingrelated strategies those policies and procedures are inherently limited because they cannot anticipate the existence or future development of currently unanticipated or unknown risks accordingly we could suffer adverse effects as a result of our failure to anticipate and manage these risks properly      2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 15table of contentsvolatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our earningswe provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business foreign currency volatility influences our foreign exchange trading income as does the level of client activity foreign currency volatility and changes in client activity may result in reduced foreign exchange trading income fluctuations in exchange rates may raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods we also are exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of our holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investments in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense we have policies and procedures in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange risks including hedgingrelated strategies any failure or circumvention of our procedures to mitigate risk may impact earnings negatively please see market risk in the risk management section included in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for a more detailed discussion of market risks we facechanges in a number of particular market conditions can affect our earnings negativelyin past periods reductions in the volatility of currencytrading markets the level of crossborder investing activity and the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending negatively if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be affected negatively in a few of our businesses such as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings such that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues for example the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption produced losses in some securities lending programs reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a return of these conditions in the future could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity which could impact our earnings negativelyoperational risksmany types of operational risks can affect our earnings negativelywe regularly assess and monitor operational risk in our businesses despite our efforts to assess and monitor operational risk our risk management program may not be effective in all cases factors that can impact operations and expose us to risks varying in size scale and scope includefailures of technological systems or breaches of security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattackshuman errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedurestheft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third partiesdefects or interruptions in computer or communications systemsbreakdowns in processes overreliance on manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the systems and facilities that support our operationsunsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgradesdefects in product design or deliverydifficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from thirdparty vendorsnegative developments in relationships with key counterparties thirdparty vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations andexternal events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorismwhile we have in place many controls and business continuity plans designed to address many of these factors these plans may not operate successfully to mitigate these risks effectively we also may fail to identify or fully understand the implications and risks associated with changes in the financial markets or our businessesparticularly as we expand our geographic footprint product pipeline and client typesand consequently fail to enhance our controls and business continuity plans to address those changes in an adequate or timely fashion if our controls and business continuity plans do not address the factors noted above and operate to mitigate the associated risks successfully such factors may have a negative impact on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition an important aspect of managing our operational risk is creating a risk culture in which all employees fully understand that there is risk in every aspect of our business and the importance of managing risk as it relates to their job functions we continue to enhance our risk    16  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsmanagement program to support our risk culture ensuring that it is sustainable and appropriate to our role as a major financial institution nonetheless if we fail to create the appropriate environment that sensitizes all of our employees to managing risk our business could be impacted adverselyfailures of our technological systems or breaches of our security measures including but not limited to those resulting from cyberattacks may result in lossesany failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and our proprietary and confidential information and security breaches  including cyberattacks  could expose us to a risk of theft loss or other misappropriation of this information our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error failure of our controls with respect to granting access to our systems malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our or our clients proprietary and confidential information resulting in theft loss or other misappropriation of this informationinformation security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors if we fail to continue to upgrade our technology infrastructure to ensure effective cybersecurity relative to the type size and complexity of our operations we could become more vulnerable to cyberattack additionally our computer communications data processing networks backup business continuity or other operating information or technology systems including those that we outsource to other providers may fail to operate properly or become disabled overloaded or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could have a negative effect on our ability to conduct our business activitiesthe third parties with which we do business also are susceptible to the foregoing risks including regarding the third parties with which they are similarly interconnected or on which they otherwise rely and our or their business operations and activities may therefore be affected adversely perhaps materially by failures terminations errors or malfeasance by or attacks or constraints on one or more financial technology infrastructure or government institutions or intermediaries with whom we or they are interconnected or conduct business in addition our clients often use their own devices such as computers smart phones and tablets to manage their accounts which may heighten the risk of system failures interruptions or security breachesin recent years several financial services firms suffered successful cyberattacks launched both domestically and from abroad resulting in the disruption of services to clients loss or misappropriation of sensitive or private data and reputational harm although we have not to our knowledge suffered a material breach of our systems we and our clients have been subject to cyberattacks and it is possible that we could suffer a material breach in the future because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures we expect to continue to face increasing cyberthreats including computer viruses malicious code distributed denial of service attacks phishing attacks information security breaches or employee or contractor error or malfeasance that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of our our clients or other parties confidential personal proprietary or other information or otherwise disrupt compromise or damage our or our clients or other parties business assets operations and activities our status as a global financial institution and the nature of our client base may enhance the risk that we are targeted by such cyberthreats if a breach of our security occurs we could be the subject of legal claims or proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients each of which could have a negative effect on our business financial condition and results of operations a breach of our security also may affect adversely our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business an event that results in the loss of information also may require us to reconstruct lost data or reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring services which could be costly and have a negative impact on our business and reputationfurther even if not directed at us attacks on financial or other institutions important to the overall functioning of the financial system or on our counterparties could affect directly or indirectly aspects of our business the systems and models we employ to analyze monitor and mitigate risks as well as for other business purposes are inherently limited may be not be effective in all cases and in any case cannot eliminate all risks that we facewe use various systems and models in analyzing and monitoring several risk categories as well as for other business purposes however these systems and models are inherently limited because they involve techniques and judgments that cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome in the markets in which we operate nor can they anticipate the specifics and timing of such outcomes further these systems and models may fail to quantify accurately the magnitude of      2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 17table of contentsthe risks we face our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions and historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may be incorrect and the historical correlations on which we rely may not continue to be relevant consequently the measurements that we make may not adequately capture or express the true risk profiles of our businesses or provide accurate data for other business purposes each of which ultimately could have a negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations errors in the underlying model or model assumptions or inadequate model assumptions could result in unanticipated and adverse consequences including material loss or noncompliance with regulatory requirements or expectationserrors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or have a negative effect on our earnings in other waysin our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities we effect or process transactions for clients and for ourselves that involve very large amounts of money failure to manage or mitigate operational risks properly can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and correctedour dependence on technology and the need to frequently update our technology infrastructure exposes us to risks that also can result in lossesour businesses depend on information technology infrastructure both internal and external to record and process among other things a large volume of increasingly complex transactions and other data in many currencies on a daily basis across numerous and diverse markets and jurisdictions due to our dependence on technology and the important role it plays in our business operations we must constantly improve and update our information technology infrastructure updating these systems can require significant resources and often involves implementation integration and security risks that could cause financial reputational and operational harm failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business and regulatory issues prior to and during the introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to align operational capabilities adequately with evolving client commitments and expectations may have a negative impact on our results of operations the failure to respond properly to and invest in changes and advancements in technology could limit our ability to attract and retain clients prevent us from offering products and services comparable to those offered by our competitors inhibit our ability to meet regulatory requirements or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operationsa failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business

controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system will be met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are otherwise required to restate our financial statements we could be required to implement expensive and timeconsuming remedial measures and could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports in addition there are risks that individuals either employees or contractors consciously circumvent established control mechanisms by for example exceeding trading or investment management limitations or committing fraudfailure of any of our thirdparty vendors to perform can result in lossesthirdparty vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services and network access our use of thirdparty vendors exposes us to the risk that such vendors may not comply with their servicing and other contractual obligations to us including with respect to indemnification and information security and to the risk that we may not satisfy applicable regulatory responsibilities regarding the management and oversight of third parties and outsourcing providers while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could have a negative effect on our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these thirdparty vendors or performing the tasks they perform for ourselves could create

manage our relationships with multiple regulators in various jurisdictions our inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market and manage our relationships with regulators could have an adverse effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally the failure to mitigate properly such risks or the failure of our operating infrastructure to support such international activities could result in operational failures and regulatory fines or sanctions which could affect our business and results of operations adverselywe actively strive to optimize our geographic footprint this optimization may occur by establishing operations in lowercost locations or by outsourcing to thirdparty vendors in various jurisdictions these efforts expose us to the risk that we may not maintain service quality control or effective management within these operations in addition we are exposed to the relevant macroeconomic political and similar risks generally involved in doing business in those jurisdictions the increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in some jurisdictions could lead to an increase in reputational risk during periods of transition greater operational risk and client concern exist with respect to maintaining a high level of service deliveryin addition we are subject in our global

costlyin the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods the new presidential administration has called for substantial reform to financial services regulation which may include comprehensive changes to existing laws and regulations and their application by regulators we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally other governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and

failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility

our earningswe provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result

we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively

our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings   24  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsour success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictionsa significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand address or comply with those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can affect our earnings and growth prospects negativelywe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would affect our earnings negativelywe may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earningswe may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disruptedother riskschanges in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may affect our earnings negativelyboth us and nonus tax authorities from time to

financial condition and results of operationsthe allowance for credit losses consists of the following componentsspecific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateralinherent allowance the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss dataspecific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustmentframework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments for each segment the probability of defaultand the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financethe quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriateloans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffsmanagements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2016 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to periodadditionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements

maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periodsnorthern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assetsin determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2016 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 471 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 750 to 250 that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 700in evaluating possible revisions

factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and

december 31 2016 to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities northern trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results trades and bids the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited as of december 31 2015 northern trust estimated the fair value of auction rate securities by developing and maintaining a pricing model that discounted estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model included the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities as of december 31 2016 northern trusts level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trusts own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa

balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the market value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to nii even in periods of volatile interest ratesthere are four commonly recognized types of interest rate riskrepricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilitiesyield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curvebasis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics andembedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changesinterest rate risk measurement reporting and analysisnorthern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation of nii provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii simulation of mve provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capabilitynii sensitivitythe modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis riskthe nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates balance sheet changes and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in nii sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed the following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation   82  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of

reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk nii sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided     2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 83table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsmve sensitivitymve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis riskthe mve sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in mve sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulationthe present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using remaining lives which are based on a combination of northern trusts actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment  some balances are assumed to be core and have long lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives andthe present values of most noninterestrelated balances such as receivables equipment and payables are the same as their book valuesthe following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates given the low level of

currency risk overviewnorthern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trusts currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expensein addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trusts growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange riskforeign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periodsforeign currency risk measurementnorthern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfoliovar measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trusts trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the risk management function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonablenessforeign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysisnorthern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trusts market risksautomated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the risk management function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on riskthe table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a oneday horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from

financial instruments northern trust is a party to various derivative instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients as part of its trading activity for its own account and as part of its risk management activities these instruments include foreign exchange contracts interest rate contracts total return swap contracts and credit default swap contracts derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value within other assets and other liabilities derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative in the consolidated

and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in income for substantially all fair value hedges northern trust applies the shortcut method of accounting available under gaap which assumes there is no ineffectiveness in a hedge as a result changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are equal to the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative and are reflected in the same line item for fair value hedges that do not qualify for the shortcut method of accounting northern trust utilizes regression analysis a

in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective matures is terminated or sold if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur or if northern trust removes the derivatives hedge designation subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in foreign exchange trading income or security commissions and trading income for discontinued cash flow hedges the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in aoci and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring for discontinued fair value hedges the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be

represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates loans and leases are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment segment and by class northern trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal a class of loans and leases is a subset of a segment the components of which has similar risk characteristics measurement attributes or risk monitoring methods the classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional commercial real estate lease financing net nonus and other the classes within the personal segment have been defined as residential real estate private client and otherloan classification loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding net of unearned income loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value undrawn commitments relating to loans that are not held for sale are recorded in other liabilities and are carried at the amount of unamortized fees with an allowance for credit loss liability recognized for any estimated probable lossesrecognition of income interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless in the opinion of management there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement or interest or principal is more than 90 days contractually past due and the loan is not wellsecured and in the process of collection loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonperforming and interest income is recorded on a cash basis past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due for disclosure purposes loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current at the time a loan is determined to be nonperforming interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period interest collected on nonperforming loans is applied to principal unless in the opinion of management collectability of principal is not in doubt managements assessment of indicators of loan and lease collectability and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition do not meaningfully vary    98  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsbetween loan and lease classes nonperforming loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and leases and in accordance with regulatory guidance relate primarily to expected payment performance a loan is eligible to be returned to performing status when i no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or ii the loan has otherwise become wellsecured possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt including accrued interest in full and is in the process of collection through action reasonably expected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future a loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six payment periods by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms and northern trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time additionally a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status provided there was a welldocumented credit evaluation of the borrowers financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance generally a minimum of six payment periods under the revised termsimpaired loans a loan is considered to be impaired when based on current information and events management determines that it is probable that northern trust will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans are identified through ongoing credit management and risk rating processes including the formal review of past due and watch list credits payment performance and delinquency status are critical factors in identifying impairment for all loans and leases particularly those within the residential real estate private client and personalother classes other key factors considered in identifying impairment of loans and leases within the commercial and institutional nonus lease financing and commercialother classes relate to the borrowers ability to perform under the terms of the obligation as measured through the assessment of future cash flows including consideration of collateral value market value and other factors a loan is also considered to be impaired if its terms have been modified as a concession by northern trust or a bankruptcy court resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring tdr all tdrs are reported as impaired loans in the calendar year of their restructuring in subsequent years a tdr may cease being reported as impaired if the loan was modified at a market rate and has performed according to the modified terms for at least six payment periods a loan that has been modified at a below market rate will return to performing status if it satisfies the six payment periods performance requirement however it will remain reported as impaired impairment is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or the loans observable market value if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan based on the certainty of loss either a specific allowance is established or a chargeoff is recorded for the difference smaller balance individually less than 1000000 homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment and excluded from impaired loan disclosures as allowed under applicable accounting standards northern trusts accounting policies for material impaired loans is consistent across all classes of loans and leasespremium discounts origination costs and fees premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan certain direct origination costs and fees are netted deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loans yielddirect financing and leverage leases unearned lease income from direct financing and leveraged leases is recognized using the interest method this method provides a constant rate of return on the unrecovered investment over the life of the lease the rate of return and the allocation of income over the lease term are recalculated from the inception of the lease if during the lease term assumptions regarding the amount or timing of estimated cash flows change lease residual values are established at the inception of the lease based on inhouse valuations and market analyses provided by outside parties lease residual values are reviewed at least annually for otti a decline in the estimated residual value of a leased asset determined to be otherthantemporary would be recorded in the period in which the decline is identified as a reduction of interest incomei allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components specific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows the value of collateral and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is      2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 99table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statementsdetermined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral inherent allowance the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the quantitative inherent allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework where management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not fully contemplated in the quantitative methodology to compute an adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfoliothe results of the inherent allowance estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by northern trusts loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management reporting segment management and corporate finance loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance northern trusts policies relative to the chargingoff of uncollectible loans and leases are consistent across both loan and lease segments determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established are based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level determined to be appropriate through the above processes actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater or less than actual net chargeoffsnorthern trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both onbalancesheet and offbalancesheet activity using a consistent methodologyfor purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit the exposure at default includes an estimated drawdown of unused credit based on a credit conversion factor the proportionate amount of the quantitative methodology calculation after any required adjustment in the qualitative framework results in the required allowance for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit as of the reporting date       the portion of the allowance assigned to loans and leases is reported as a contra asset directly following loans and leases in the consolidated balance sheets the portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheetsj standby letters of credit fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in other operating income using the straightline method over the lives of the underlying agreements northern trusts recorded other liability for standby letters of credit reflecting the obligation it has undertaken is measured as the amount of unamortized fees on these instrumentsk buildings and equipment buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation the charge for depreciation is computed using the straightline method based on the following range of lives buildings  up to 30 years equipment  3 to 10

asset and liability approach to account for income taxes the objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities the measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax ratestax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax

fair value measurementsfair value under gaap is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement datefair value hierarchy the following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs levels 1 2 and 3 used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by northern trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity unobservable inputs reflect the entitys own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available gaap requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation northern trusts policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred no transfers between fair value levels occurred during the years ended december 31 2016 or 2015level 1  quoted active market prices for identical assets or liabilities northern trusts level 1 assets are comprised of available for sale investments in us treasury securitieslevel 2  observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets northern trusts level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and thirdparty prices if a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed predetermined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset types characteristics the exception is researched and if the price is not able to be validated an alternate pricing vendor is utilized consistent with    102  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation

million as of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 respectively were all valued using external pricing vendorsnorthern trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities on a daily basis periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous days reported prices for each security predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor quarterly northern trust reviews documentation from thirdparty pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by northern trust to each security classification are appropriate annually valuation inputs used within thirdparty pricing vendor valuations are reviewed for propriety on a sample basis through a comparison of inputs used to comparable market data including security classifications that are less actively traded and security classifications comprising significant portions of the portfoliolevel 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts credit spreads default probabilities and recovery rates for credit default swap contracts interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts northern trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments factors considered include the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered materiallevel 3  valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace as of december 31 2016 northern trusts level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased in 2008 from northern trust clients to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities northern trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results trades and bids the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited as of december 31 2015 northern trust estimated the fair value of auction rate securities by developing and maintaining a pricing model that discounted estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model included the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about estimated remaining lives of the securities significant increases decreases in the estimated remaining lives or the discount rates in isolation would result in a slightly lower higher fair value measurement northern trusts level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa inc class b common stock visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swap also requires periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa

whereby a mix of us and nonus equities fixed income and alternative asset investments are used to maximize the longterm return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk this is accomplished by diversifying the portfolio across various asset classes with the goal of reducing volatility of return and among various issuers of securities to reduce principal risk northern trust utilizes an assetliability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and longterm objectives the process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions the financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the plans investment objectives risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities plan funded status and corporate financial condition the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming growth in plan liabilities over the long runthe target allocation of plan assets since may

valuation methodologies used by northern trust for the us qualified plan assets measured at fair valuelevel 1  quoted active market prices for identical assets or liabilities the plans level 1 investments are comprised of a mutual fund and domestic common stocks the plans level 1 investments that are exchange traded are valued at the closing price reported by the respective exchanges on the day of valuationlevel 2  observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets and modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets the plans level 2 assets are comprised of us government obligations and collective trust funds the investments in collective trust funds fair values are calculated on a scheduled basis using the closing market prices and accruals of securities in the funds total value of the funds divided by the number of fund shares currently issued and outstanding redemptions of the collective trust funds occur by contract at the respective funds redemption date nav level 3  valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace the plans level 3 assets are comprised of private equity and hedge funds which invest in underlying groups of investment funds or other pooled investment vehicles that are selected by the respective funds investment managers the investment funds and the underlying investments held by these investment funds are valued at fair value in determining the fair value of the underlying investments of each fund the funds investment manager or general partner takes into account the estimated value reported by the underlying funds as well as any other considerations that may in their judgment increase or decrease such estimated valuewhile northern trust believes its valuation methods for plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants the use of different methodologies or assumptions particularly as applied to level 3 assets could have a material effect on the computation of the estimated

held at december 31a building block approach is employed for northern trusts us pension plan in determining the longterm rate of return for plan assets historical markets and longterm historical relationships between equities fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the longrun current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined the longterm portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing the rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate based on this

the outcome of some matters is inherently difficult to predict andor the range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated this may be the case in matters that i will be decided by a jury ii are in early

against such established limits and monitoring the level of any interest rate sensitivity gaps created by such positions when establishing position limits market liquidity and volatility as well as experience in each market are taken into accountcredit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of northern trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses respectively on these instruments net of any cash collateral received or deposited the amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices or credit spreads fluctuate northern trusts risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities credit support annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of northern trusts counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with northern trustnorthern trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between northern trust and the counterparty derivative assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were each reduced by 17 billion and 13 billion as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as a result of master netting arrangements and similar agreements in place derivative assets

riskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the

3582 million and 5532 million at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included 3175 million and 1630 million respectively posted against these liabilities resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at december 31 2016 and 2015 of 407 million and 3902 million

related to its asset servicing asset management foreign exchange cash management and commercial banking businesses the operations of northern trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both us and nonus source income and assets nonus source income and assets are not separately identified in northern trusts internal management reporting system however northern trust is required to disclose nonus activities based on the domicile of the customer due to the complex and integrated nature of northern trusts activities it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues expenses and assets between us and nonusdomiciled customers therefore certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues expenses and assets between us and nonus operationsfor purposes of this disclosure all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to nonus operations interest expense is allocated to nonus operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding allocations of indirect noninterest expenses when made are based on various methods such as time space and number of employees   158  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation

requirementsnorthern trust and the bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal bank regulatory authorities under these requirements banks must maintain specific ratios of total and tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets and of tier 1 capital to adjusted average quarterly assets in order to be classified as wellcapitalized the regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not wellcapitalized and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a banks financial statementsas of december 31 2016 and 2015
