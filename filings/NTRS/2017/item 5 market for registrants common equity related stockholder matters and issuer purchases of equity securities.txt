to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by certain bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios the capital plan

onbalancesheet foreign exposure held by such bank holding companies as a result capital plans submitted by the corporation will no longer be subject to objection from the federal reserve board on qualitative grounds and the corporation will be subject to certain reduced regulatory reporting requirements in lieu of the qualitative assessment of ccar the corporation will be subject to a targeted horizontal review of specific areas of capital planning conducted as part of the federal reserve boards normal supervisory process any supervisory findings resulting from the targeted horizontal review will be addressed through supervisory communications capital plans submitted by the corporation remain subject to objection from the federal reserve board on quantitative groundsthe corporation

requirementsthe regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institutions financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factorsthe riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2016 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulatorsunder the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratiospursuant to the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacy     2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 7table of contentsthe riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the

institutions will be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30 insured depository institutions that are advanced approaches institutions such as the bank also will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered wellcapitalized under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratiobasel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 125 in 2017 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures the us countercyclical buffer is currently set at 0 and the federal reserve board has indicated that generally it will provide a 12month phasein of changes to the minimum required countercyclical buffer and use the notice and comment process to communicate proposed changes to the public certain other jurisdictions in which the corporation has credit exposures currently have countercyclical buffers set at levels greater than 0 slightly increasing the weighted average countercyclical buffer to which the corporation is subjectliquidity standardsin addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain
