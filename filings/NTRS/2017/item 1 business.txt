attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and growregulatory and legal risksfailure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earningsvirtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly changes in laws or failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negativelythe ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operationsthe doddfrank act which became law in july 2010 has had a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate while the new presidential administration and us congress have indicated that the doddfrank act may be subject to further scrutiny and that some of its provisions may be amended or repealed there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the existing provisions will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies in february 2017 an executive order was issued by the new presidential administration i establishing core principles for regulating the us financial system and ii instructing the us secretary of the treasury to      2016 annual report  northern trust corporation 21table of

also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirementschanges in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earningsthe doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely see supervision and regulation under item 1 business of this annual report on form 10k for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subjectmoney market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsorson july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules was completed in october 2016 the effects of these rules could lead to lower investor demand for money market mutual funds reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise affect our business earnings or financial condition adverselychanges by the us and other governments to policies involving the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costlyin the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods the new presidential administration has called for substantial reform to financial services regulation which may include comprehensive changes to existing laws and regulations and their application by regulators we cannot currently predict the impact if any of these changes to our business additionally other governments and regulators may take actions that increase intervention in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies any such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible legislative or enhanced regulatory changes and the extent of regulatory activity is uncertain and difficult to predictwe may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilitiesour businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against

adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negativelywe may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earningswe estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or

consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will impact growth negatively a failure to grow organically or to integrate successfully an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients

acquire complementary businesses andor technologies we may not achieve the expected benefits of such transactions which could result in increased costs lowered revenues ineffective deployment of capital regulatory concerns exit costs or diminished competitive position or reputation these risks may be increased if the acquired company operates internationally or in a geographic location where we do not already have significant business operations execution of our business strategies also may require certain regulatory approvals or consents which may include approvals of the federal reserve board and other domestic and nonus regulatory authorities these regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact

regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing conditions are not satisfiedcompetition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnelour success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our

or as a group could affect our clients perception of our abilities adverselywe are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earningswe provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have and in some cases has had a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitabilitydamage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenuedamage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of

on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further whereas negative public opinion once was driven primarily by adverse news coverage in traditional media the proliferation of social media channels utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity including through the rapid dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences we need to invest in innovation constantly and the inability or failure to do so may affect our businesses and earnings negativelyour success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could affect our business opportunities growth and earnings adversely there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while corresponding revenues take time to develop or may not develop at allfailure to understand or appreciate fully the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will affect our businesses and earnings negativelythe success of our innovation efforts depends in part on the successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and deliver them to clients effectively our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to the success of our efforts at innovation and investment in new product and service offerings   24  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsour success with

those standards appropriately could affect our growth prospects or affect our reputation negatively we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to identify and manage significant risks successfully we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct

markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to understand fully the implications of changes in legal or regulatory requirements our businesses or the financial markets or fail to enhance our risk framework to address those changes in a timely fashion if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with

evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateralinherent allowance the inherent allowance estimation methodology is based on internally developed loss dataspecific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustmentframework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into segments for each segment the probability of defaultand the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financethe quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriateloans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffsmanagements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2016 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to periodadditionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements

maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuariallybased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periodsnorthern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assetsin determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2016 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 471 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 750 to 250 that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 700in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trusts december 31 2016 measurement date the following were considereddiscount rate northern trust estimates the discount rate for its us pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to the aon hewitt aa above median yield curve as of the measurement date this yield curve is composed of individual zerocoupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99year time horizon zerocoupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds this yield curve model referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 446 at december 31 2016 for the qualified and nonqualified plans a decrease from 471 at december 31 2015compensation level based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience the compensation scale assumption is based on a graded schedule from 900 to 250 that averages 439rate of return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the longterm 30 years rate of return on plan assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trusts rate of return assumption for the qualified plan decreased from 700 for 2016 to 675 for 2017mortality table northern trust uses the

inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 20 of northern trusts assets carried at fair value are classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchangeapproximately 80 of northern trusts assets and 97 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using models in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets investment securities classified as available for sale make up 94 of level 2 assets with the remaining 6 primarily consisting of derivative financial instruments level 2 liabilities are comprised solely of derivative financial instrumentsnorthern trusts level 2 assets include available for sale and trading account securities the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors northern trust has a wellestablished process to validate prices received from pricing vendors as discussed more fully in note 3 fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary dataas of december 31 2016 all derivative assets and liabilities excluding the swap related to the sale of certain visa class b common shares described below were classified as level 2 and approximately 96 measured on a notional value basis related to clientrelated and trading activities predominantly consisting of foreign exchange contracts derivative instruments are valued internally using widely accepted incomebased models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect contractual terms of contracts northern trust evaluated the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of derivative instruments factors considered included the likelihood of default by northern trust and its counterparties the remaining maturities of the instruments net exposures after giving effect to master netting agreements available collateral and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments the resulting valuation adjustments are not considered materialas of december 31 2016 the fair value of northern trusts level 3 assets was 47 million level 3 assets consist of auction rate securities purchased from northern trust clients as of december 31 2016 to estimate the fair value of auction rate securities northern trust uses external pricing vendors that incorporate transaction details and market based inputs such as past auction results trades and bids the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements are the prices of the securities supported by little market activity and for which trading is limited as of december 31 2015 northern trust estimated the fair value of auction rate securities by developing and maintaining a pricing model that discounted estimated cash flows over their estimated remaining lives significant inputs to the model included the contractual terms of the securities credit risk ratings discount rates forward interest rates creditliquidity spreads and northern trusts own assumptions about the estimated remaining lives of the securities as of december 31 2016 northern trusts level 3 liabilities consisted of swaps that northern trust entered into with the purchaser of 11 million and 10 million shares of visa class b common shares previously held by northern trust and sold in june 2016 and 2015 respectively pursuant to the swaps northern trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the visa class b common shares into shares of visa inc class a common stock visa class a common shares such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and northern trust will be compensated for any antidilutive adjustments to the ratio the swaps also require periodic payments from northern trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of visa class a common shares and a fixed rate of interest the fair value of the swaps are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are northern trusts own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the visa class b common shares into visa class a common shares the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated growth rate of the visa class a common share price see visa class b common shares under note 24 contingent liabilities provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for further informationwhile northern trust believes its valuation methods for

measures such as net interest income nii sensitivity market value of equity mve var and notional position sizesinterest rate risk overviewinterest rate risk is the risk to nii associated with the balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on nii depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the market value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to nii even in periods of volatile interest ratesthere are four commonly recognized types of interest rate riskrepricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilitiesyield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curvebasis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics andembedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changesinterest rate risk measurement reporting and analysisnorthern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk nii sensitivity and mve sensitivity simulation of nii provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on nii simulation of mve provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on mve as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capabilitynii sensitivitythe modeling of nii sensitivity incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis riskthe nii sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates balance sheet changes and client behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate nii sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in nii sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from that assumed the following key assumptions are incorporated into the simulation   82  2016 annual report  northern trust corporation   table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsthe balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of

results of operationsmve sensitivitymve is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on mve is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures mve sensitivity under various rate scenarios stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates nonparallel ie twist changes to yield curves that result in their becoming

behaviors under changing rate environments these assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior the simulation cannot precisely estimate mve sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions therefore there could be a change in mve sensitivity to the extent that actual behavior differs from the incorporated assumptions many of the assumptions that apply to nii sensitivity also apply to mve sensitivity simulations with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the mve simulationthe present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using remaining lives which are based on a combination of northern trusts actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment  some balances are assumed to be core and have long lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives andthe present values of most noninterestrelated balances such as receivables equipment and payables are the same as their book valuesthe following table shows the estimated impact on mve of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up from current market implied forward rates given the low level of
