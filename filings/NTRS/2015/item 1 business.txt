resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising interest rates disruptions in financial markets negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to us any diminished ability to raise additional capital if needed could subject us to liability restrict our ability to grow require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings or

and liquidity  rating agencies publish credit ratings and outlooks on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratings agencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally  downgrades in our credit ratings may adversely affect our borrowing costs our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity a failure to maintain an acceptable credit rating may also preclude us from being competitive in certain products additionally our counterparties as well as our clients rely on our financial strength and stability and evaluate the risks of doing business with us if we experience diminished financial strength or stability actual or perceived a decline in our stock price or a reduced credit rating our counterparties may be less willing to enter into transactions secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our business  the risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in which the consolidation and in some instances failure of financial institutions including major global financial institutions could result in a smaller number of larger counterparties and competitors if our counterparties perceive us to be a less viable counterparty our ability to enter into financial transactions on terms acceptable to us or our clients on our or our clients behalf will be materially compromised if our clients reduce their deposits with us or select other service providers for all or a portion of the services we provide to them our revenues will decrease accordingly    our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity  a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to successfully manage the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow    regulatory and legal risks  failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings  virtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations similarly failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition    the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations  the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies as some provisions still require final rules to be promulgated further changes                       22     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents  resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements    changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings  the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements could ultimately impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise adversely affect our business and earnings see supervision and regulation under item 1 business for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subject    the implementation of money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsors  on july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise adversely affect our business earnings or financial condition the implementation of these rules will occur in phases from july 2015 through october 2016    further intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costly  in recent years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws home mortgage lending and loanmodification requirements these and other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and would likely involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict    our business may be adversely impacted by litigation and regulatory enforcement   our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk actions brought against us may result in injunctions

effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently negatively affecting our earnings  in the ordinary course of our business we also are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us in enforcement matters claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible    we may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability with a negative effect on our earnings  we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate    if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could negatively affect our earnings  managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses failure to comply with these standards adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability    strategic risks  if we do not successfully execute strategic plans we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted  our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies a failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth a failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate an acquisition could have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems    competition for our employees is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel  our success depends in large part on our ability to attract new employees retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could adversely affect our clients perception of our abilities                       24     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents we are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings  we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large in some cases wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures these competitive pressures may negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could negatively affect our ability to maintain or increase our profitability    damage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue  damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could negatively affect our earnings damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business the global financial crisis of 200708 and current political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry could also negatively impact our reputation    we need to constantly invest in innovation and the inability or failure to do so may negatively affect our businesses and earnings  our success in the competitive environment in which we operate requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities growth and earnings there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with innovation efforts we must invest significant time and resources in developing and marketing new products and services and expected timetables for the introduction and development of new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not be met further our revenues and costs may fluctuate because new products and services generally require startup costs while revenues take time to develop or may not develop at all    failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings  our success in capitalizing on innovation depends in part on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings                       25     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents our success with large complex clients requires an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions   a significant portion of our business involves providing certain services to large complex clients which require an understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in various jurisdictions any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss suffer damage to our reputation that could restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that could limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive in addition our businesses and the markets in which we operate are continuously evolving we may fail to fully understand the implications of changes in our businesses or the financial markets or fail to adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to address those changes if our risk framework is ineffective either because it fails to keep pace with changes in the financial markets regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer reputational damage or find ourselves out of compliance with applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or expectations these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly global business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services    failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our investment management fiduciary and assetservicing businesses if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would negatively affect our earnings    we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings  we may take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted    other risks  changes in tax laws and interpretations and tax challenges may negatively affect our earnings  both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and our actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings  in the course of our business we are sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which may require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings

component of the allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay  at december 31 2014 the specific allowance component amounted to 211 million compared with 249 million at the end of 2013 the 38 million decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in nonperforming loans attributable to restructurings and payoffs as a result of improvement in commercial and institutional commercial real estate and residential real estate loans partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans  the decrease in the specific component of the allowance from 325 million in 2012 to 249 million in 2013 was primarily attributable to chargeoffs and payoffs partially offset by additional allowances provided for new and existing nonperforming loans    inherent component of the allowance the inherent component of the allowance addresses exposure relating to probable but unidentified creditrelated losses the amount of the inherent loss allowance is based on factors which incorporate managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio                       55     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    the historical chargeoff experience for each loan category is based on data from the current and preceding three years qualitative factors reviewed by management include changes in asset quality metrics the nature and volume of the portfolio economic and business conditions and collateral valuations such as property values as well as other pertinent information changes in collateral values delinquency ratios portfolio volume and concentration and other asset quality metrics including managements subjective evaluation of economic and business conditions result in adjustments of qualitative allowance factors that are applied in the determination of inherent allowance requirements  the inherent component of the allowance also covers the credit exposure associated with undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit to estimate the allowance for credit losses on these instruments management uses conversion rates to determine the estimated amount that will be drawn and assigns an allowance factor determined in accordance with the methodology utilized for outstanding loans  the inherent portion of the allowance decreased 82 million to 2748 million at december 31 2014 compared with 2830 million at december 31 2013 which decreased 121 million from 2951 million at december 31 2012 the decrease in 2014 is primarily attributable to improvement in the credit quality of commercial real estate residential real estate and commercial and institutional loans in certain markets partially offset by additional allowances established for increased loan volumes in the commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loan classes the decrease in 2013 reflected improvement in the credit quality of commercial and institutional and commercial real estate loans in certain markets as compared to 2012    overall allowance the evaluation of the factors above resulted in a total allowance for credit losses of 2959 million at december 31 2014 compared with 3079 million at the end of 2013 the allowance of 2670 million assigned to loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases was 084 at december 31 2014 down from a 2781 million allowance representing 095 of total loans and leases at december 31 2013 allowances assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit totaled 289 million and 298 million at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively and are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet    provision the provision for credit losses was 60 million and net chargeoffs totaled 180 million in 2014 this compares with a 200 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 397 million in 2013 and a 250 million provision for credit losses and net chargeoffs of 263 million in 2012    impaired loans  a loan is impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt restructuring as of december 31 2014 impaired loans totaled 2422 million and included 1513 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings as compared to total impaired loans of 2934 million at december 31 2013 which included 1625 million of loans deemed troubled debt restructurings impaired loans had 66 million and 104 million of the allowance for credit losses allocated to them at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loans market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent

condition and results of operations  for northern trust accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses pension plan accounting and otti of investment securities management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board    allowance for credit losses  the allowance for credit losses represents managements estimate of probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposures  the allowance for credit losses consists of the following components    specific allowance the amount of specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral    inherent allowance the amount of inherent allowance is based on factors which incorporate managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors are applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and are reviewed quarterly by northern trusts loan loss reserve committee which includes representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financial management  the quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff as described in the asset quality section are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriate  loans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffs  managements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2014 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  additionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the

examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements    pension plan accounting  northern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods  northern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assets  in determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2014 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 500 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 775  in evaluating possible revisions to pensionrelated assumptions for the us plans as of northern trusts december 31 2014 measurement date the following were considered    ÿ    discount rate northern trust estimates the discount rate for its us pension plans by applying the projected cash flows for future benefit payments to several published discount rate yield curves as of the measurement date these yield curves are composed of individual zerocoupon interest rates for 60 different time periods over a 30year time horizon zerocoupon rates utilized by the yield curves are mathematically derived from observable market yields for aarated corporate bonds the yield curve models referenced by northern trust in establishing the discount rate supported a rate between 394 and 429 with an average decrease of 90 basis points over the prior year as such northern trust decreased the discount rate for the qualified and nonqualified plans from 500 for december 31 2013 to 425 for december 31 2014    ÿ    compensation level based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience the compensation scale assumption is based on a sliding scale that averages 425    ÿ    rate of return on plan assets the expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the longterm 30 years rate of return on plan assets which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before longterm capital market assumptions are determined peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness as a result of these analyses northern trusts rate of return assumption decreased from 775 for 2014 to 725 for 2015    ÿ

prices for identical assets and liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place level 3 approximately 14 of northern trusts assets carried at fair value is classified as level 1 northern trust typically does not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange  approximately 86 of northern trusts assets and 100 of its liabilities carried at fair value are categorized as level 2 as they are valued using

institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the north american industry classification system naics    standby letters of credit obligate northern trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients if under the contractual terms of the agreement the clients are unable to do so these instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments including commercial paper bond financing initial margin requirements on futures exchanges and similar transactions northern trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants standby letters of credit of 45 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 include 2214 million and 2089 million respectively of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others the weighted average maturity of standby letters of credit was 27 months and 25 months at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively  as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients northern trust lends securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the northern trust counterparty risk management committee in connection with these activities northern trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrowers failure to return securities when due should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted borrowers are required to collateralize fully securities received with cash or marketable securities as securities are loaned collateral is maintained at a minimum of 100 of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest the collateral is revalued on a daily basis the amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification was 981 billion and 827 billion at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to collateralize fully securities borrowed management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and no liability was recorded at december 31 2014 or 2013 related to these indemnifications  additional information about northern trusts offbalancesheet financial instruments is

whose equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest investors that finance a vie through debt or equity interests or other counterparties that provide other forms of support such as guarantees subordinated fee arrangements or certain types of derivative contracts are variable interest holders in the entity the variable interest holder if any that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity and a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the vies primary beneficiary and is

cost via an equity ownership in a trust with the remaining 7080 provided by third party nonrecourse debt holders in such transactions the trusts which are vies are created to provide the lessee use of the property with substantially all of the rights and obligations of ownership the lessees maintenance and operation of the leased property has a direct effect on the fair value of the underlying property and the lessee also has the ability to increase the benefits it can receive and limit the losses it can suffer by the manner in which it uses the property as a result northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these vies given it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies    tax credit

operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments northern trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any community development projects as it lacks the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the underlying investments or to affect their ability to operate in compliance with the rules and regulations necessary for the qualification of tax credits generated by equity investments this power is held by the general partners and managing members who

regular basis the treasury department has the daytoday responsibility for measuring analyzing and managing liquidity risk within the thresholds and limits established by alco and the board  northern trusts global liquidity management framework focuses on five key areas  position management liquidity analysis contingency planning peer group comparisons and management reporting  while also

sources including client deposits institutional and personal from our campis and wealth management businesses wholesale funding from the capital markets maturities of shortterm investments federal home loan bank advances and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds while management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity at december 31 2014 the bank had over 255 billion of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings the bank is also very active in the us interbank funding market providing an important source of additional liquidity and lowcost funds liquidity is used by a variety of activities including client withdrawals purchases of securities net

major subsidiaries is approved annually by the business risk committee and regularly updated and tested this plan which can be activated in the event of an actual liquidity crisis details organizational responsibilities and defines specific actions designed to ensure the proper maintenance of liquidity during periods of stress in addition international banking subsidiaries have individual contingent liquidity plans which reflect the global plan  northern trust also analyzes its liquidity profile against a peer group of large us bank holding companies including other major custody banks this analysis provides management with benchmarking information highlights industry trends and supports the establishment of new policies and strategies  management regularly reviews various reports analyses and other information depicting changes in northern trusts liquidity mix and funding concentrations overall financial market conditions and other internal and external liquidity metrics management uses this information to evaluate the overall status of northern trusts liquidity position and anticipate potential events that could stress that position in the future an overall liquidity status level for northern trust established and regularly reviewed by alco is monitored on an ongoing basis by the treasury department downgrades in liquidity status resulting from internal external or industrywide events trigger specific predetermined actions and limits designed to position northern trust to better respond to potential liquidity stresses    corporation liquidity  the liquidity of the corporation is managed separately from that of the bank the primary sources of cash for the corporation are issuances of debt or equity dividend payments from the bank and interest earned on investment securities and money market assets in 2014 the corporation issued series c preferred stock for net proceeds of 3885 million and received 3000 million of dividends from the bank dividends from the bank are subject to certain restrictions as discussed in further detail in note 30 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and

extent of the downgrade northern trusts relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions current market conditions and other factors in addition as discussed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data northern trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain creditriskrelated contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare northern trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the

increased levels of total deposits and proceeds from the issuance of series c preferred stock partially offset by repayments of senior notes and other longterm debt the repurchase of common stock pursuant to the corporations share repurchase program and cash dividends paid to common stockholders the increase in total deposits is attributable to higher levels of demand and other noninterestbearing client deposits the decreases in senior notes and other longterm debt reflect the maturity of 5000 million of fixedrate senior notes and 1350 million of repayments of borrowings from the federal home loan bank respectively  for the year ended december 31 2013 net cash provided by financing activities totaled 44 billion primarily reflecting increased levels of total deposits

and other noninterestbearing client deposits from december 31 2012 levels the decrease in usoffice noninterestbearing deposits was largely driven by the expiration on december 31 2012 of the fdics

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    risk identification and risk management process  northern trust utilizes a risk classification system called the risk universe to identify and classify the risks that it inherently faces the risk universe forms the basis of common risk language and provides a consistent framework for the definition and categorization of risk and the organization of risk management activities the risk universe supports risk management at all levels and enables risks to be clearly and consistently identified categorized assessed managed and reported to line management corporate risk and committees the risk universe is reviewed and approved at least annually by gerc and the board of directors  as part of the integrated enterprise risk framework northern trust has established four key processes as described below    risk appetite northern trust defines the organizations risk appetite as the amount and types of risk that it is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities to achieve its strategic and financial objectives risk appetite is a tool to measure northern trusts willingness to take risk and reflects northern trusts tolerance of certain levels of risk exposures as measured at the enterprise and business level as applicable northern trusts corporate risk appetite statement is established by senior management and reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors the corporate risk appetite statement reflects northern trusts expectation that risk is consciously considered as part of daytoday activities and strategic decisions northern trust manages its business activities consistent with the risk appetite statement in which specific guidelines are detailed for credit operational fiduciary compliance market liquidity and strategic risk gerc reviews the measurement and assessment of risk within the corporation and against northern trusts corporate risk appetite statement when appropriate gerc addresses emerging risk issues and directs risk mitigation actions    assessment of risks northern trusts risk assessment process consists of a series of programs that identify manage and measure risks risk assessments are performed on a regular basis by business risk management and facilitated by the risk management function the risk assessment process draws on the input of management staff and risk personnel across the business focusing on the inherent drivers of risk the effectiveness of controls and the resulting residual risks    risk management embedding risk management processes extend beyond risk assessment and measurement and are embedded in strategic and business planning and decisionmaking although the risk management function sets the direction for northern trusts risk management activities northern trusts businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams    risk reporting review and communication the risk reporting review and communication process produces risk reports that provide updates on the risk profile performance against risk guidelines and thresholds and analysis and trend information all of which highlight top and emerging risks for management and the board risk reporting includes a robust escalation process to alert senior management of significant issues    risk control  risk control is an internal independent review function within the risk management function risk control is managed by the chief risk control officer is comprised of the following four groups each with its own risk focus and oversight the business risk committee oversees risk control and each of the groups below    model risk management  financial and risk modeling are used by northern trust to inform numerous decisions regarding risk management as well as capital estimation financial reporting and disclosure valuation and pricing and portfolio management model risk may result from decisions based on models that produce incorrect results or models that are improperly used model

related to the advanced internal ratings based approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk the basel independent verification program assesses the effectiveness of the credit risk operational risk market risk capital adequacy and disclosure frameworks the basel independent verification team presents an annual assessment report of its findings to the board of directors or its designated committee who is required to review and approve the effectiveness of the advanced systems each year    credit review  credit review provides an independent ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across northern trust the scope of credit review activities includes all clientrelated transactions that give rise to credit exposure and processes that are designed to manage or monitor such exposure credit exposure includes credit risk inherent in the entire portfolio as well as individual credits or transactions in the form of direct outstandings potential exposure and contingent liabilities that are on or offbalance sheet    global compliance testing  global compliance testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations as well as corresponding northern trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities global compliance testing

these audits directly to the audit committee audit services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience including risk management expertise the general auditor reports directly to the audit committee and the corporations chief executive officer    credit risk  credit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to perform on an obligation    credit risk overview  credit risk is inherent in many of northern trusts activities a significant component of credit risk relates to the securities portfolio and loan portfolio in addition credit risk is inherent in certain contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit northern trusts loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large us financial institutions and is generally more conservative in terms of credit risk in particular northern trust is generally    ÿ    not an originator of loan products to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations                       73     2014 annual report to shareholders

management is achieved postclose through the sale of participations and    ÿ    not a participant in leveraged financial transactions such as project finance privateequityoriginated acquisition financing or hedge fund leveraging    credit risk framework and governance  the credit risk management function is the focal point of the credit risk management framework and while independent of the businesses it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive credit risk management this function approves policies establishes the credit risk framework and monitors adherence to corporate policies external regulations and established procedures credit risk management reports directly to the cro independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework is provided by risk control  the credit risk management function provides a system of checks and balances for northern trusts diverse creditrelated activities by monitoring these activities and practices and promoting their uniform application throughout northern trust these activities are designed to diversify credit exposure on an industry and client basis and reduce overall credit risk  the credit risk framework provides authorities for approval of the extension of credit individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities credits exceeding individual authority because of amount rating term or other conditions are referred to the relevant group credit approval committee credit decisions involving exposure in excess of these limits require the approval of the senior credit committee  the counterparty risk management committee has sole credit authority for the approval modification or renewal of credit exposure to all wholesale market counterparties    credit risk measurement  an integral component of credit risk measurement is northern trusts internal risk rating system northern trusts internal risk rating system enables identification measurement approval and monitoring of credit risk northern trust uses the advanced internal ratingbased approach to calculate regulatory capital using regulatory formulas and exposure level risk information from northern trusts internal rating system calculations include entityspecific information about the obligors or counterpartys probability of default and exposurespecific information about loss given default exposure at default and maturity northern trusts internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any modeled linkage to external credit ratings  the credit risk management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal riskrating system this includes the development monitoring and maintenance of the models as well as providing information to the credit risk management committee to support model approval and monitoring of ongoing model performance independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of risk control    loans and other extensions of credit  a significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit these contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements provided in item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and in the offbalancesheet arrangements section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as part of its credit process northern trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification approval and monitoring of credit risk borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting management reporting setting of loss allowances and economic capital calculations borrower risk ratings are discussed further in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements  the credit risk management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant andor weakerrated credits this approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems in addition independent from the credit risk management function credit review as part of risk control undertakes both onsite and offsite file reviews that evaluate effectiveness of managements implementation of the credit risk managements requirements                       74     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    northern trust maintains a loan portfolio watch list for credits with borrower ratings of 6 to 9 these credits which include all nonperforming credits are expected to exhibit minimally acceptable probabilities of default elevated risk of default or are currently in default loans outstanding to watch list borrowers associated with these risk profiles that are not currently in default but have limited financial flexibility totaled 4212 million at december 31 2014 cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements and borrowers typically have minimal cushion in adverse down cycle scenarios an integral part of the credit risk management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits if any need to be placed on nonperforming status or charged off    counterparty credit risk  counterparty credit risk for northern trust primarily arises from overthecounter otc currency and interest rate derivatives and from indemnified securities lending transactions which in turn are derived from a variety of funding treasury trading and custodyrelated activities credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor  to calculate exposure northern trust treats repurchase agreements reverse repurchase agreements and indemnified securities lending transactions as repostyle transactions foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as otc derivatives the exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants is determined based on operational requirements the characteristics of the contract type and the portfolio size and complexity    credit risk mitigation  northern trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for clientrelated credit exposures however northern trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure northern trust has policies in place to ensure that credit risk mitigation is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories    physical and financial collateral northern trusts primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trusts estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collaterals value    netting onbalance sheet netting is employed on a limited basis netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting agreements a subset of these arrangements are conducted under an isda credit support annex northern trust has elected to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of netting within its regulatory capital calculation at this time    guarantees personal and corporate guarantees are often taken to facilitate potential collection efforts and to protect northern trusts claims relative to other creditors northern trust may also recognize implied support where the commitment provided is less than that of a legally enforceable guarantee in its assignment of borrower probability of default as permitted under us supervisory guidance northern trust has elected not to take the credit risk mitigation capital benefit of guarantors within its regulatory capital calculation at this time                       75     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    another important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure such as in any single or small number of related obligorcounterparty loan type industry geography country or risk mitigant processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits    operational risk  operational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events    operational risk overview  operational risk is inherent in each of northern trusts businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems operating problems product design and delivery difficulties or catastrophes to result in unexpected losses operational risk includes    ÿ    execution delivery and process management risk    ÿ    risk resulting from business disruption and system failures    ÿ    risk of damage to physical assets    ÿ    risk

control operational risk northern trust maintains a framework that consists of risk management policies programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment  northern trusts operational risk management strategy is to    ÿ    align the operational risk framework with evolving business and industry practice and with regulatory requirements    ÿ    identify assess and mitigate risks inherent in business strategies    ÿ    promote risk awareness and foster a proactive risk management environment within each business and    ÿ    report key topics and developments to

risk management function is responsible for defining the operational risk framework and providing independent oversight of the framework across northern trust it is the responsibility of each business to implement the corporatewide operational risk framework as well as business specific risk management programs to identify monitor measure and manage operational risk and mitigate northern trusts exposure to loss risk control provides independent oversight and review    operational risk framework and governance  the orc is responsible for overseeing the activities of northern trust related to the management of operational risk this committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to compliance and fiduciary risks the purpose of this committee is to provide executive managements insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks                       76     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation

approving the operational risk management framework and programs that support the coordination of operational risk activities to identify monitor measure manage and report on operational risk in addition orc serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its programs  operational risk is identified monitored measured managed and mitigated through the operational risk framework the framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that impact risk and drive action to reduce future loss events several key programs support the operational risk framework including    ÿ    loss event data program  a program that collects loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure various business analyses and a basel advanced management approach ama capital quantification both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification thresholds drive analysis action and escalation through northern trusts businesses and operational risk management    ÿ    risk and control selfassessment  a structured risk management process used by northern trusts the businesses to analyze the risks that are present in their respective business environments processes and activities and to assess the adequacy of associated internal controls    ÿ    operational risk scenario analysis  a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible highseverity operational losses this practice facilitates managements consideration of operational risk to which the business is exposed and the potential impact and response to such events    ÿ    product and process risk management program  a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified noncredit products

events as discussed in risk control model risk management also is part of the operational risk framework    operational risk measurement  northern trust utilizes a basel ama capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the corporation and applicable us banking subsidiaries northern trusts ama capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the loss event data risk and control selfassessment and operational risk scenario analysis programs to derive required capital while internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification external loss data is also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process business environment and internal control factor information is used to estimate loss frequency and as an adjustment to capital estimates the ama capital quantification process uses a loss distribution approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 999th percentile over a oneyear time horizon                       77     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    information security  northern trusts approach to information security begins at a governance level with its organizational structure and support from executive management and risk committees comprising members from across the business in addition technology risk is mitigated not only through a strong governance process but also internal controls and risk management practices designed to keep risk at levels appropriate to northern trusts overall risk appetite and the inherent risk in the markets in which northern trust operates the desired control environment is expressed through northern trusts policies standards and guidelines that together define its tolerance for risk each

scenario analyses alco establishes and monitors guidelines based on measures such as simulation of earnings soe sensitivity of economic value of equity seve value at risk var and notional position sizes  the market risk framework components of risk monitoring risk reporting and analysis and risk measurement are discussed below    interest rate risk overview  interest rate risk is the risk to earnings or common capital due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of capital to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates  there are four commonly recognized types of interest rate risk    ÿ    repricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities    ÿ    yield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve    ÿ    basis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics and    ÿ    embedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes    interest rate risk measurement reporting and analysis  northern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability    sensitivity of earnings soe  the modeling of soe incorporates onbalance sheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions    ÿ    the balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of which some recent increases are assumed to be temporary in nature and longterm fixed rate borrowings that upon maturity are replaced with overnight wholesale instruments    ÿ    prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions                       80     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations      ÿ    cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a thirdparty vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the thirdparty mortgage analytics vendor    ÿ    nonmaturity deposit rates are projected based on northern trusts actual historical pattern of pricing these products or based on judgment when there is no appropriate history or when current pricing strategies differ from history    ÿ    commercial demand deposits are treated as shortterm rate sensitive as these balances may receive an explicit interest rate or an earnings credit that can be applied to fees for services provided by northern trust and    ÿ    new business rates are based on current spreads to market indices    the following table shows the estimated impact on the next twelve months of pretax earnings of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates given the low level of interest rates the simulation of earnings for rates 100 and 200 basis points lower would not provide meaningful results    table 37 interest rate risk simulation of pretax earnings

them becoming steeper or flatter and changes to the relationship among the yield curves ie basis risk  the simulations of earnings do not incorporate any management actions that may be used to mitigate negative consequences of actual interest rate movements for that reason and others they do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as conservative estimates of interest rate risk soe is not directly comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided  during the year ended december 31 2014 northern trust did not exceed its soe limits    sensitivity of economic value of equity seve  economic value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100 or 200 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptions    ÿ    prepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions    ÿ    cash flows for structured securities are estimated using a thirdparty vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the thirdparty mortgage analytics vendor    ÿ    nonmaturity deposit rates are projected based on northern trusts actual historical pattern of pricing projected rates may also be based on judgment when there is no appropriate history or when current pricing strategies differ from history the present value of these deposits are based on estimated remaining lives that are based on northern trusts actual historical runoff patterns with some balances assumed to be temporary    ÿ    the present values of most noninterestrelated balances such as receivables equipment and payables are the same as their book values and    ÿ    the initial shock to current rates assumes the relationship among market yield curves eg treasury and libor remains the same in each interest rate scenario                         81     2014 annual report to shareholders

measured by the soe and seve simulation techniques to an acceptable level within the context of riskreturn tradeoffs a variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including    ÿ    purchase of securities    ÿ    sale of securities that are classified as available for sale    ÿ    issuance of senior notes and subordinated notes    ÿ    collateralized borrowings from the federal home loan bank    ÿ    placing and taking eurodollar time deposits and    ÿ    hedges with various types of derivative financial instruments    northern trust strives to use the most effective instruments for implementing its interest rate risk management strategies considering the costs liquidity collateral and capital requirements of the various alternatives and the riskreturn tradeoffs    foreign currency risk overview  northern trust is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trusts currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense  in addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trusts growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange risk  foreign currency trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods                       82     2014 annual report to shareholders     northern trust corporation       table of contents foreign currency risk measurement  northern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio  var measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions directly from northern trusts trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies corporate market risk monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonableness    foreign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysis  northern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of alternative risk metrics offering corroborating measures and useful perspectives on northern trusts market risks  automated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the corporate market risk unit also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with an historical perspective on risk  the table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the quarters indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a one day horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to diversification benefits derived from the two subcomponents

contracts consisting mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients interest rate management needs but also including a small number of caps floors and swaptions an option to enter into an interest rate swap all interest rate derivative transactions are executed by the treasury department when northern trust enters into client transactions its practice is to mitigate the resulting
