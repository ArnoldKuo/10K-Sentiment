are satisfied moreover a banking entity only may retain a limited ownership interest in such funds and must monitor and track investments in such covered funds carefully to ensure that the ownership interest in the fund does not exceed regulatory thresholds a banking entity that sponsors or invests in certain private funds is also restricted from providing credit or other support to the funds or permitting the funds to use the name of the bank the volcker rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule compliance with the volcker rule generally has been required since july 21 2015 but the federal reserve board has extended the conformance period for compliance with certain portions of the prohibition against sponsoring or investing in certain legacy

insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 5table of contentsrequirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distresspayment of dividendsthe corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries the corporation may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirementsvarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a statechartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approvalthe bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividendscapital planning and stress testingthe corporations capital distributions are subject to federal reserve board oversight the major component of that oversight is the federal reserve boards comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar exercise implementing its capital plan rules these rules require bank holding companies having 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit annual capital plans to their respective federal reserve bank the corporation also is required to collect and report certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the federal reserve board to monitor progress against the annual capital plans the ccar exercise is an intensive assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies as well as of the processes used by bank holding companies to assess their capital needs through ccar the federal reserve board assesses whether bank holding companies have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the corporation and other affected bank holding companies may pay dividends repurchase stock and make other capital distributions only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve board and as to which the federal reserve board has not objected the federal reserve board may object to a capital plan for a number of reasons including if the capital plan does not show that the covered bank holding company will meet for each quarter throughout the ninequarter planning horizon covered by the capital plan all minimum regulatory capital ratios under applicable capital rules as in effect for that quarter as well as all minimum regulatory capital ratios on a pro forma basis under the base case and stressful scenarios including a severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve board the capital plan rules also stipulate that a covered bank holding company may not make a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution it will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios in evaluating a capital plan the federal reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors consistent with prior federal reserve board guidance ccar rules provide that capital plans contemplating dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 of projected aftertax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny the corporations common stock dividend payout ratio was 353 in 2015the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve board in january 2015 as part of the federal reserve boards 2015 ccar exercise and the federal reserve board did not object to the corporations plan due to a change in the capital planning schedule the corporation will submit its 2016 capital plan to the federal reserve board by april 5 2016 the federal reserve board has indicated that it expects to publish either its objection or nonobjection to the 2016 capital plan and proposed capital actions such as dividend payments and share repurchases by june 30 2016 the corporation anticipates announcing its proposed 2016 capital plan distributions shortly thereafter     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation

substantially overlap and the federal reserve board implements them at the bank holding company level on a coordinated basis under the dfast regulations the corporation is required to undergo regulatory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve board annually and to conduct internal stress tests pursuant to regulatory requirements semiannually the bank also is required to conduct its own annual internal stress test although it is permitted to combine certain reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with the results of the corporation these requirements involve both

a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factorsthe riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank are based upon the 2011 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board basel iii the basel iii rules are currently being phased in and will come into full effect by january 1 2022to implement basel iii for bank holding companies including the corporation the federal reserve board established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines the federal banking regulators also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2015 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulatorsunder the final basel iii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to disclose publicly certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy in order to implement the capital rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to complete satisfactorily a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel iii rules and previously effective regulations the corporation and the bank completed their parallel runs in 2014 and are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and disclose publicly their riskbased capital ratiospursuant to the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act the corporation is subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach the corporation is therefore required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and is subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of its capital adequacythe riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as wellcapitalized are provided in the following charttable 1 riskbased and leverage capital ratios as of december 31 2015

approaches institutions such as the bank also will be required to maintain at least a 30 supplementary leverage ratio to be considered wellcapitalized under the rule the supplementary leverage ratio differs from the leverage ratio in that the leverage ratio does not take into account certain offbalancesheet assets and exposures that are reflected in the supplementary leverage ratiobasel iii also introduced a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above the minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount ranging from at least 0625 in 2016 to at least 25 in 2019 the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking organizations with a common equity tier 1 ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduced a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposuresliquidity standardsin addition to capital adequacy standards basel iii introduced two quantitative liquidity standards a liquidity coverage ratio lcr and a net stable funding ratio nsfr the lcr is intended to promote the shortterm resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations improve the banking industrys ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk in september 2014 the us banking agencies finalized rules to implement the lcr in the united states for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank among other things the finalized lcr rules require covered banking organizations which include the corporation and the bank to maintain an amount of highquality liquid assets hqlas equal to or greater than 100 of the banking organizations total net cash outflows over a thirtycalendarday standardized supervisory liquidity stress scenario the lcr is being phased in with full implementation beginning on january 1 2017 currently northern trust is required to calculate its lcr on a monthly basis daily calculation of the lcr will be required beginning in july 2016 additionally on november 24 2015 the federal reserve board proposed rules that would require large banking organizations such as the corporation to disclose publicly certain lcr information on a quarterly basisthe nsfr requires banking organizations to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and offbalancesheet activities more specifically the nsfr requires that the ratio of available stable funding relative to the amount of required stable funding be equal to at least 100 on an ongoing basis the basel committee finalized its nsfr rules in october 2014 to be implemented by the federal reserve board as a minimum standard by january 1 2018 the federal reserve board has not yet issued a proposal to implement the nsfrthe enhanced prudential standards discussed above specify certain liquidity risk management practices to be followed by covered large us banks and bank holding companies including the corporation and the bank these practices include an independent review of liquidity risk management and the establishment of cash flow projections a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits the corporations board of directors board also is required to establish and maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered hqlas based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing this liquidity buffer must be tailored to northern trusts business risks and is in addition to other liquidity requirements such as the lcr and nsfr discussed above the enhanced prudential standards also establish requirements and responsibilities for the board of directors and its business risk committee with respect to liquidity risk management the enhanced prudential standards require northern trust to engage in liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios and time horizons tailored to its specific products and risk profile in january 2015 the board of directors approved a new liquidity management policy establishing the principles and guidelines for the corporation to govern the processes and activities for the management of its liquidity position among other matters this policy includes limits and thresholds related to the enhanced prudential standards liquidity buffer and the lcrprompt corrective actionthe fdic improvement act of 1991 requires the appropriate federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to a depository institution if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards while these regulations apply only to banks such as the bank the federal reserve board is authorized to take
