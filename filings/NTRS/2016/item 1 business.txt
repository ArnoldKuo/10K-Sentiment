sufficient resources to meet our business needs and commitments to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients to maintain our credit ratings in response to regulatory changes including capital rules or for other purposes however our ability to access the capital markets if needed will depend on a number of factors including the state of the financial markets rising

secured or unsecured with us our clients may reduce or place limits on the level of services we provide them or seek other service providers or our prospective clients may select other service providers all of which may have other adverse effects on our businessthe risk that we may be perceived as less creditworthy relative to other market participants is higher in a market environment in

services to large complex clients which by their nature require substantial liquidity our failure to manage successfully the liquidity and balance sheet issues attendant to this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and growregulatory and legal risksfailure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earningsvirtually every aspect of our business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are regulated heavily by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are directed specifically at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not our stockholders or other security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries also are regulated heavily by bank securities and other regulators globally regulatory violations or the failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or impact our reputation adversely failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations adversely similarly failure to comply with new requirements or with future changes in laws or regulations may impact our results of operations and financial condition negativelythe ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operationsthe doddfrank act which became law in july 2010 has had and will continue to have a significant impact on the regulatory and compliance structure in which we operate there remains uncertainty surrounding the manner in which certain of the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies as these provisions still require final rules to be promulgated further changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices or otherwise affect our business adversely these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirementschanges in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earningsthe doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators increased capital requirements ultimately could impact the profitability of certain of our business activities require changes to certain business practices or otherwise affect our business and earnings adversely see supervision and regulation under item 1 business for a further discussion of the various capital and liquidity requirements to which we are and in the future may be subjectthe implementation of money market mutual fund reform could lower the desirability of money market mutual funds for investors and reduce the profitability of money market mutual funds for sponsorson july 23 2014 the sec approved final rules implementing money market mutual fund reform which among other things require institutional prime money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value and implement procedures that may restrict redemption in certain circumstances through the imposition of liquidity fees and gates against investor redemptions the implementation of these rules could lower investor demand for money market mutual funds reduce the profitability of our money market mutual fund products or otherwise affect our business earnings or financial condition adversely the implementation of these rules is occurring in phases through october 2016further intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face and make compliance with the evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies more difficult and costlyin the past several years various regulatory bodies have demonstrated heightened enforcement scrutiny through many regulatory initiatives including antimoneylaundering rules antibribery laws and loanmodification requirements these      2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 20table of contentsand other regulatory requirements have increased compliance costs and regulatory risks and may lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees governments may take further actions to change significantly the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry and likely would involve additional legislative and regulatory requirements imposed on banks and other financial services companies such actions could increase compliance costs and regulatory risks lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation affect our ability to compete successfully and also may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predictwe may be impacted adversely by claims or litigation including claims or litigation relating to our fiduciary responsibilitiesour businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty perceived to be owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk is heightened when we act as a fiduciary for our clients and may be further heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in our stock price and those of other financial institutions increases this risk claims made or actions brought against us whether founded or unfounded may result in injunctions settlements damages fines or penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or require changes to our business even if we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial and public reports regarding claims made against us may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders consequently affecting our earnings negativelywe may be impacted adversely by regulatory enforcement matters in the ordinary course of our business we are subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be directed specifically at us in conjunction with enforcement matters we may face claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties or the imposition of other remedial sanctions any of which could have an adverse impact on us we may fail to set aside adequate reserves for or otherwise underestimate our liability relating to pending and threatened claims with a negative effect on our earningswe estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case our earnings will be affected adversely to the extent that our

authorities may impose conditions on the activities or transactions contemplated by our business strategies which may impact negatively our ability to realize fully the expected benefits of certain opportunities further acquisitions we announce may not be completed if we do not receive the required regulatory approvals if regulatory approvals are significantly delayed or if other closing

retain and motivate our existing employees and continue to compensate our employees competitively competition for the best employees in most activities in which we engage can be intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain key personnel factors that affect our ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees include our compensation and benefits programs our profitability and our reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees our ability to attract and retain key executives and other employees may be hindered as a result of existing and potential regulations applicable to incentive compensation and other aspects of our compensation programs these regulations may not apply to some of our competitors and to other institutions with which we compete for talent the unexpected loss of services of key personnel both in businesses and corporate functions could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our markets operations and clients years of industry experience and in some cases the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel similarly the loss of key employees either individually or as a group could affect our clients perception of our abilities adverselywe are subject to intense competition in all aspects of our businesses which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earningswe provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets we compete against large wellcapitalized and geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for other types of institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures the same may be said for competitors based in nonus jurisdictions where legal and regulatory environments may be more favorable than those applicable to the corporation and the bank as usdomiciled financial institutions these competitive pressures may have a negative effect on our earnings and ability to grow furthermore pricing pressures as a result of the willingness of competitors to offer comparable or improved products or services at a lower price may result in a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services which could have a negative effect on our ability to maintain or increase our profitabilitydamage to our reputation could have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenuedamage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and therefore could affect our earnings negatively damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of rating agencies regulators stockholders and other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation ultimately would have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business the global financial crisis of 200708 and resultant political and public sentiment regarding financial institutions have resulted in a significant amount of adverse media coverage of financial institutions actions by the financial services industry generally or by other members of or individuals in the financial services industry also could impact our reputation negatively further the proliferation of social media websites utilized by us and third parties as well as the personal use of social media by our employees and others may increase the risk of negative publicity which could harm our reputation or have other negative consequences      2015 annual report

keep pace with changes in the financial markets legal and regulatory requirements our businesses our counterparties clients or service providers or for other reasons we could incur losses suffer

critical accounting estimates on page 56 for a description of the change in estimation methodology the adoption of this methodology resulted in a reduction in the commercial and institutional

according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when its terms have been modified as a concession resulting from the debtors financial difficulties referred to as a troubled debt

31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively impaired loans are measured based upon the loans market price the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent if the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan dependent upon the level of certainty of loss either a

losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements the loan and lease portfolio and other lendingrelated credit exposures are regularly reviewed to evaluate the level of the allowance for credit losses in determining an appropriate allowance level northern trust evaluates the allowance necessary for impaired loans and lendingrelated commitments and also estimates losses inherent in other lendingrelated credit exposuresthe allowance for credit losses consists of the following componentsspecific allowance the specific allowance is determined through an individual evaluation of loans and lendingrelated commitments considered impaired that is based on expected future cash flows collateral value and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay for impaired loans where the amount of specific allowance if any is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral thirdparty appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management these appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect managements judgment as to the realizable value of the collateralinherent allowance as of december 31 2015 northern trust changed the estimation methodology for inherent losses that have been incurred in the loan and lease portfolio the new estimation methodology is more quantitatively focused than the previous methodology as it is based on internally developed loss data specific to the northern trust loan and lease portfolio the change in methodology is accounted for as a change in estimate applicable to current period and future periods the new estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan and lease portfolio into homogeneous segments for each segment the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative inherent allowance the estimated allowance is reviewed by the loan loss reserve committee within a qualitative adjustment framework to determine an appropriate adjustment to the quantitative inherent allowance for each segment of the loan portfolio in determining the appropriate adjustment management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors potential limitations in the quantitative methodology and environmental factors that are not contemplated in the quantitative methodology the loan loss reserve committee is comprised of representatives from credit risk management the reporting segments and corporate financefor periods prior to the methodology change the amount of inherent allowance was based on factors that incorporated managements evaluation of historical chargeoff experience and various qualitative factors such as managements evaluation of economic and business conditions and changes in the character and size of the loan portfolio factors were applied to loan and lease credit exposures aggregated by shared risk characteristics and were reviewed quarterly by the loan loss reserve committeethe quarterly analysis of the specific and inherent allowance components and the control process maintained by credit risk management and the lending staff are the principal methods relied upon by management for the timely identification of and adjustment for changes in estimated credit loss levels in addition to northern trusts own experience management also considers regulatory guidance control processes and analyses employed to determine an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are reviewed on at least an annual basis and modified as considered appropriateloans leases and other extensions of credit deemed uncollectible are charged to the allowance for credit losses subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance determinations as to whether loan balances for which the collectability is in question are chargedoff or a specific reserve is established based on managements assessment as to the level of certainty regarding the amount of loss the provision for credit losses which is charged to income is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for credit losses to the level deemed to be appropriate through the above process actual losses may vary from current estimates and the amount of the provision for credit losses may be either greater than or less than actual net chargeoffsmanagements estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption management evaluates numerous variables many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates in determining an appropriate allowance level due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2015 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to periodadditionally as an integral part of their examination process various federal and state regulatory agencies also review the allowance for credit losses these agencies may require that certain loan balances be classified differently or charged off when their credit evaluations differ from those of management based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination however management believes that the allowance for credit losses adequately addresses these uncertainties and has been established at an appropriate level to cover probable losses which have occurred as of the date of the consolidated

accountingnorthern trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all us employees the qualified plan and a us noncontributory supplemental pension plan the nonqualified plan certain europeanbased employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans which are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates asset returns compensation increases mortality rates and other actuarialbased projections relating to the plans due to the longterm nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur the differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the future working lifetime of eligible participants as a result differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected pension obligation and actual experience affect stockholders equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periodsnorthern trust recognizes the significant impact that these pensionrelated assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year these procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans actuaries in addition to actual experience adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities known compensation trends and policies as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated longterm rate of return on plan assetsin determining the pension expense for the us plans in 2015 northern trust utilized a discount rate of 425 for both the qualified plan and the nonqualified plan the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a sliding scale that averaged 425 the expected longterm rate of return on qualified plan assets was 725in

is appropriately recognized recorded and monitored recognition of credit risk mitigants in capital estimations is dependent upon the form of mitigation northern trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categoriesphysical and financial collateral northern trusts primary risk mitigation approaches include the requirement of collateral andor documented guarantees liquidation of collateral that is securing credit risk exposures is considered in northern trusts estimation of loss given default residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property in cases where loans to commercial or certain wealth management clients are secured by marketable securities the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies the frequency of collateral valuation increases commensurate with the volatility of the collaterals

well as various scenario analyses alco and mlrc establish and monitor guidelines based on measures such as soe seve var and notional position sizesinterest rate risk overviewinterest rate risk is the risk to earnings associated with the balance sheet or value of equity due to changes in interest rates changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on earnings depending on the positioning of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet instruments the impact to earnings will primarily come through net interest income but it can also impact certain types of fees related to the balance sheet changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets liabilities and offbalancesheet positions which indirectly impact the value of equity to mitigate interest rate risk the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities adjusted for hedges are highly correlated which allows northern trusts interestbearing assets and liabilities to contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest ratesthere are four commonly recognized types of interest rate riskrepricing which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilitiesyield curve which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curvebasis which arises from the changing relationships between rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics andembedded optionality which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changesinterest rate risk measurement reporting and analysisnorthern trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk soe and seve simulation of earnings provides management with a shortterm view of the impact of interest rate changes on future earnings simulation of economic value of equity provides management with a longterm view of interest rate changes on the economic value of equity as of the periodend balance sheet both simulation models use the same initial market interest rates and product balances these two techniques which are performed monthly are complementary and are used in concert to provide a comprehensive interest rate risk management capability     2015 annual report  northern trust corporation 77table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssensitivity of earnings soethe modeling of soe incorporates onbalancesheet positions as well as derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps that are used to manage interest rate risk northern trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity ie change in earnings if future rates are 100 or 200 basis points higher than base case forward rates each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a oneyear period the 100 basis point increase for example consists of twelve consecutive monthly increases of 83 basis points the model simulations also incorporate the following assumptionsthe balance sheet size and mix generally remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing with the exception of certain products such as securities the assumed reinvestment of which is determined by managements strategies nonmaturity deposits of which some recent increases are assumed to be temporary in nature and longterm fixed rate borrowings that upon maturity are replaced with overnight wholesale instrumentsprepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a thirdparty mortgage analytics

twelve months of pretax earnings excluding fee waivers of 100 and 200 basis point upward movements in interest rates relative to forward rates given the low level of interest rates the simulation of

equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities net of the value of instruments that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items the potential effect of interest rate changes on economic equity is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit northern trust uses current market rates and the future rates implied by these market rates as the base case and measures seve if current rates are immediately shocked up by 100

and results of operationsforeign currency risk overviewnorthern trusts balance sheet is exposed to nontrading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities investment in nonus subsidiaries and future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expense to manage currency exposures on the balance sheet northern trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency if those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet northern trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure foreign exchange contracts are also used to reduce northern trusts currency exposure to future nonus dollar denominated revenue and expensein addition northern trust provides foreign exchange services to clients most of these services are provided in connection with northern trusts growing global custody business in the normal course of business northern trust also engages in trading of nonus currencies for its own account both activities are considered trading activities the primary market risk associated with global foreign exchange trading activities is foreign exchange riskforeign currency trading

risk measurementnorthern trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all nonus currency positions using a var model and applying the historical simulation methodology this statistical model provides estimates based on a variety of high confidence levels of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in nonus currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days the model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies var is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfoliovar measures are computed in a vended software application which reads foreign exchange positions from northern trusts trading systems each day data vendors provide foreign exchange rates and interest rates for all currencies the corporate market risk function monitors on a daily basis var model inputs and outputs for reasonablenessforeign currency risk monitoring reporting and analysisnorthern trust monitors several variations of the foreign exchange var measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs variations include different methodologies historical variancecovariance and monte carlo equallyweighted and exponentiallyweighted volatilities horizons of one day and ten days confidence levels ranging from 95 to 9995 and look back periods of one year and four years those alternative measures provide management a rich array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on northern trusts market risksautomated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers the corporate market risk function also reviews and reports several variations of the var measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on riskthe table below presents the levels of total regulatory var and its subcomponents for global foreign currency in the years indicated below based on the historical simulation methodology a 99 confidence level a one day horizon and equally weighted volatility the total var for foreign currency is typically less than the sum of its two components due to
