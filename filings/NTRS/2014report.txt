regulation  federal banking law has established a system of federal and state supervision and regulation based on functional regulation meaning that primary regulatory oversight for a particular activity generally resides with the federal or state regulator designated as having the principal responsibility for that activity banking is supervised by federal and state banking regulators insurance by state insurance regulators derivatives and swaps activities by the cftc and securities activities by the sec and state securities regulators  a significant component of the functional regulation relates to the application of federal securities laws and sec oversight of some bank securities activities generally banks may conduct securities activities without brokerdealer registration only if the activities fall within a set of activitybased exemptions designed to allow banks to conduct only those activities traditionally considered to be primarily banking or trust activities securities activities outside these exemptions as a practical matter need to be conducted by a registered brokerdealer affiliate the investment advisers act of 1940 requires the registration of any bank or separately identifiable division of the bank that acts as investment adviser for mutual funds  another component of the functional regulation relates to the application of

early remediation requirements that are required to be established under sections 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act but these proposed rules have not yet been finalized the federal reserve board has issued final rules implementing heightened prudential standards for more stringent riskbased capital leverage liquidity risk management and stress testing requirements under the final rules us bank

prohibit the corporations subsidiaries from making a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrowers ability to repay limit the total points and fees that the corporations subsidiaries andor a mortgage broker may charge on certain mortgage loans to 3 of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices also the doddfrank act in conjunction with the federal reserve boards final rule on loan originator compensation prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and steering consumers to loans not in their interest because it will result in greater compensation for a loan originator these standards will result in a myriad of new system pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses  proprietary trading and certain relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds the doddfrank act adopts the socalled volcker rule which subject to a twoyear transition period and certain exceptions became effective on july 21 2012 and prohibits a banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading which is defined as engaging as principal for the trading account of

activities of nonus banking entities trading outside the united states and trading activities related to liquidity management the final rule also maintains the ban on sponsoring or investing in certain covered funds such as hedge funds or private equity funds the final rule requires large banking entities including the corporation to implement a detailed compliance program and on an annual basis requires the chief executive officer of the banking entity to attest that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the rule in light of the complexity of the final regulation the uncertain implementation of the final rule and the possible regulatory and legislative changes to the final rule the corporation cannot fully assess the impact of the volcker rule on its business at this time  swaps and other derivatives title vii of the doddfrank act title vii imposes a new regulatory structure on the overthecounter derivatives market including requirements for clearing exchange trading capital margin reporting and recordkeeping in addition certain swaps and other derivatives activities are required to be pushed out of insured depository institutions and conducted in separately capitalized nonbank affiliates title vii also will require certain persons to register as a major swap participant a swap dealer a majorsecuritybased swap participant or a

title vii the cftc has also finalized many rules applicable to swap dealers and other swap market participants including business conduct standards for swap dealers reporting and recordkeeping mandatory central clearing for certain swaps exchangetrading rules applicable to swaps and regulatory requirements for crossborder swap activities it is anticipated that the cftcs ongoing rulemaking process will further clarify other subjects under title vii including margin and capital requirements it is also anticipated that the sec will continue with its rulemaking process which will further clarify among other things reporting and recordkeeping obligations the scope of registration requirements central clearing requirements and exchangetraded requirements for securitybased swaps rules have also been issued to enhance the oversight of clearing and trading entities the cftc and sec have yet to complete the implementation of title vii and the complete regulatory framework for swaps and securitybased swaps continues to develop  consumer financial protection the doddfrank act established a new independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb within the federal reserve system the cfpb is tasked with establishing and implementing rules and regulations under certain federal consumer protection laws with respect to the conduct of providers of certain consumer financial products and services the cfpb has rulemaking authority over many of the statutes governing financial products and services offered to consumers for banking organizations with assets of 10 billion or more including the bank the cfpb has exclusive rule making and examination and primary enforcement authority under federal consumer financial laws in addition the doddfrank act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the cfpb this new federal and state regulatory framework may result in significant new regulatory requirements applicable to the corporation and its bank subsidiaries in respect of consumer financial products and services with potentially significant increases in compliance costs  incentive compensation arrangements the doddfrank act requires federal regulators to prescribe regulations or guidelines regarding incentivebased compensation practices at certain large financial institutions on april 14 2011 federal regulators including the fdic the federal reserve board and the sec issued a proposed rule which among other things would require certain executive officers of covered financial institutions with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more including the corporation to defer at least 50 of their annual incentivebased compensation for a minimum of three years no final rule has been issued to date  the requirements of the doddfrank act will continue to be implemented pursuant to regulations over the course of several years given the uncertainty associated with future regulatory actions the full impact such requirements will have on the corporations operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of the corporations banking subsidiaries require changes to certain of the corporations business practices impose upon the corporation more stringent capital liquidity and leverage    7    table of contents  requirements and could adversely affect certain of the corporations business activities these changes may also require the corporation and its subsidiaries to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new requirements  holding company support and crossguarantees under the fdia  under the federal deposit insurance act fdia when two or more insured depository institutions are under common control each of those depository institutions may be liable for any loss incurred or expected to be incurred by the fdic in connection with the default of any of the others each also may be liable for any assistance the fdic provides to the other institutions default means the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution  the doddfrank act amends the fdia to obligate the federal reserve board to require bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary depository institution the appropriate federal banking agency for such a depository institution may require reports from companies that control the insured depository institution to assess their ability to serve as a source of strength and to enforce compliance with the sourceofstrength requirements the term source of financial strength is defined as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to its insured depository institution subsidiaries in the event of financial distress at such subsidiaries under this requirement the corporation in the future could be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should the bank experience financial distress to date no final regulations have been adopted  this crossguarantee liability for a loss at a commonly controlled institution would be subordinated in right of payment to deposit liabilities secured obligations any other general or senior liability and any obligation subordinated to depositors or other general creditors other than obligations owed to any affiliate of the depository institution with certain exceptions  payment of dividends  the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries a significant source of funds for the corporation is dividends from the bank as a result the corporations ability to pay dividends on its common stock will depend on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the corporation in amounts sufficient to service its obligations dividend payments from the bank are subject to illinois law and to regulatory limitations generally based on capital levels and current and retained earnings imposed by various regulatory agencies with authority over the bank the ability of the bank to pay dividends is also subject to regulatory restrictions if paying dividends would impair its profitability financial condition or cash flow requirements  the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies the policy statement provides that as a matter of prudent banking a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding companys capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition accordingly without federal reserve board approval a bank holding company cannot pay cash dividends that exceed its net income and cash dividends cannot be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding companys financial health such as by borrowing  various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the bank can pay to the corporation without regulatory approval approval of the federal reserve board is required for payment of any dividend by a state chartered bank that is a member of the federal reserve system if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years in addition a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits as defined without regulatory and stockholder approval    8    table of contents the bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the bank to become undercapitalized in addition the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice the payment of dividends could depending on the financial condition of the bank be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice the doddfrank act and basel iii as defined and discussed further below impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends  additionally federal reserve board regulations require every bank holding company domiciled in the us that has 50 billion or more in total consolidated assets including the corporation to submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis the federal reserve evaluates an institutions plans to make capital distributions such as dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock as part of the capital plan reviews in some cases such as when an institutions capital plan has been rejected by the federal reserve the institution is required to receive approval from the federal reserve before making capital distributions the corporation submitted its capital plan as a part of the federal reserves 2013 capital plan review cappr and the federal reserve did not object to the corporations plan the corporation submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve in january 2014 as part of the federal reserves 2014 comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar  capital adequacy requirements  the regulators view capital levels as important indicators of an institutions financial soundness as a general matter fdicinsured depository institutions and their holding companies including the bank and the corporation are required to maintain minimum capital relative to the amount and types of assets they hold the final supervisory determination on an institutions capital adequacy is based on the regulators assessment of numerous factors  the federal reserve board has established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies including the corporation as of december 31 2013 the riskbased capital guidelines that apply to the corporation and the bank commonly referred to as basel i are based upon the 1988 capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision basel committee a committee of central banks and bank supervisors as implemented by the federal reserve board as discussed further below the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted new riskbased capital guidelines for core banks including the corporation based upon the revised framework for the international convergence of capital measurement and capital standards basel ii issued by the basel committee in november 2005 additionally on july 2 2013 the federal bank regulatory agencies introduced new capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules designed to implement the revised standards of the basel committee published in december 2010 and revised in june 2011 basel iii these basel iii rules will come into effect between january 1 2014 and january 1 2019  under the existing basel ibased guidelines the minimum ratio of total capital to riskweighted assets which are primarily the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain offbalance sheet items such as standby letters of credit but also include a nominal market risk equivalent balance related to foreign exchange and debtequity trading activities is eight percent at least half of the total capital must be composed of tier 1 capital which includes common stockholders equity including retained earnings qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and for bank holding companies only a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of trust preferred securities and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries less goodwill other disallowed intangibles and disallowed deferred tax assets among other items the federal reserve board also has adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies requiring tier 1 capital of at least four percent unless the institution is ranked a composite 1 under the camels rating system of average quarterly total consolidated assets as defined for regulatory purposes net of goodwill and certain other intangible assets    9    table of contents the federal banking regulators have also established riskbased and leverage capital guidelines that fdicinsured depository institutions such as the bank are required to meet these regulations are generally similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies the banks riskbased and leverage capital ratios remained strong at december 31 2013 and were well above the minimum regulatory requirements established by us banking regulators the riskbased and leverage capital ratios for the corporation and the bank together with the regulatory minimum ratios and the ratios required for classification as wellcapitalized are provided in the following chart                        riskbased and leverage capital ratios as ofdecember 31 2013        tier 1capital

capital adequacy the us bank regulatory agencies have issued final rules with respect to implementation of the basel ii framework under the final basel ii rules the corporation is one of a small number of core banking organizations the rules require core banking organizations to have rigorous processes for assessing overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profiles and to publicly disclose certain information about their risk profiles and capital adequacy  in order to implement the rules a core banking organization such as the corporation is required to and the corporation did adopt an implementation plan and must satisfactorily complete a parallel run in which it calculates capital requirements under both the basel ii rules and regulations effective prior to the adoption of basel ii in the us the corporation entered the parallel run in april 2010 the corporations uk guernsey and canadian entities subject to basel ii rules have already adopted the standardized approach for credit risk and the basic indicator approach for operational risk in calculating minimum regulatory capital requirements  on september 12 2010 the group of governors and heads of supervision the oversight body of the basel committee announced agreement on the calibration and phasein arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements known as basel iii on july 2 2013 the federal reserve board issued final rules implementing basel iii in the united states under these rules when fully phasedin banking organizations will be required to satisfy four riskbased capital ratios           a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of at least 45           a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 60           a total capital ratio of at least 80 and           a leverage ratio of at least 40 advanced approaches institutions such as the corporation will also be subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 30  under the federal reserve boards implementation in the final basel iii rules of a provision of the doddfrank act we are subject to a capital floor that is based on the basel iii standardized approach we will therefore be required to calculate our riskbased capital ratios under both the standardized and advanced approaches and will be subject to the more stringent of the riskbased capital ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approach in the assessment of our capital adequacy under the prompt corrective action framework on february 21 2014 the corporation was notified by the federal reserve board that both the corporation and the bank would be permitted to exit parallel run accordingly the corporation and the bank are required to use the advanced approaches methodologies to calculate and publicly disclose their riskbased capital ratios beginning with the second quarter of 2014 current results from the parallel run of the riskbased capital framework have demonstrated that the use of the advanced approaches methodologies inclusive of commitments we provided to the federal reserve regarding our approach to the calculation of riskweighted assets has not resulted in common equity tier 1 capital tier 1 capital or total riskbased capital ratios falling below the levels required for categorization as wellcapitalized these results show that as of december 31 2013 the corporations common equity tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the advanced approaches methodologies would have been 116 on a fully phasedin basis while the corporations common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the standardized approach would have been 111 on a fully phasedin basis  basel iii also introduces a capital conservation buffer requiring banking organizations to hold a buffer of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum riskbased capital requirements in an amount greater than 25 of its total riskweighted assets the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of    10    table of contents  economic stress banking organizations with a tier 1 common equity ratio above the minimum but below the conservation buffer may face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of such shortfall basel iii also introduces a countercyclical buffer of 0 to 25 of a banking organizations total riskweighted assets for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the corporation which is intended to create a capital buffer for such banking organizations during expansionary economic phases in order to protect against declines in asset prices if credit conditions weaken in general the amount of the countercyclical capital buffer is a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer established in the various jurisdictions in which the banking organization has credit exposures  the uss implementation of basel iii has increased the minimum capital thresholds for banking organizations and tightened the standards for what qualifies as capital in october 2013 the us banking agencies proposed a rule that would introduce quantitative liquidity requirements in the us for large banking organizations such as the corporation and the bank the ultimate impact of the us implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the corporation and its bank subsidiaries is currently being reviewed at this point we cannot determine the ultimate effect these final and proposed regulations would have upon our earnings or financial position however we believe our capital strength balance sheet and business model leave us well positioned for the us implementation of basel iii  prompt corrective action  under the fdia the federal banking agencies must take prompt corrective action against undercapitalized us banking institutions us banking institutions are assigned one of five capital categories wellcapitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and are subjected to different regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls a banking institution is deemed to be wellcapitalized if the banking institution has a total riskbased capital ratio of 100 or greater a tier 1 riskbased capital ratio of 60 or greater and a leverage ratio of 50 or greater and the institution is not subject to an order written agreement capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific level for any capital measure under certain circumstances a wellcapitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic restrictions on certain business activities and appointment of the fdic as conservator or receiver as of december 31 2013 the corporation and the bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as wellcapitalized  as noted above on december 20 2011 the federal reserve board requested comment on a proposed rule to implement requirements in section 165 and 166 of the doddfrank act to establish stricter prudential standards for us bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of 50 billion or more the proposed rule incorporates the section 166 early remediation requirements similar to prompt corrective action the early remediation requirements would require firms subject to the proposal to take increasingly stringent corrective measures as the firms financial condition deteriorates triggers for remediation include capital levels stress test results and risk management weaknesses no final rule implementing section 166 has been issued to date  examination and enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies  a principal objective of the us bank regulatory system is to protect depositors by ensuring the financial safety and soundness of banks to that end the banking regulators have broad regulatory examination and enforcement powers including the power to issue cease and desist orders impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver failure to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the corporation and its banking subsidiaries as well as officers directors and other institutionaffiliated parties of these organizations to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil money penalties the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of unsafe or unsound circumstances exist    11    table of contents the fdic may terminate a depository institutions deposit insurance upon a finding that the institutions financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule regulation order or condition enacted or imposed by the institutions regulatory agency engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws regulations and supervisory agreements could subject the bank the corporation and other subsidiaries of the corporation or their officers directors and institutionaffiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions  restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders  fdicinsured banks including the corporations bank subsidiaries are subject to restrictions under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act as implemented by regulation w which govern transactions between fdicinsured banks and any affiliated entity whether that entity is the banks parent holding company a holding company affiliate of the bank or a subsidiary of the bank regulation w restrictions apply to certain covered transactions including extensions of credit issuance of guarantees investments or asset purchases in general these restrictions require that any extensions of credit must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and are limited as to any one of the corporation or such nonbank affiliates to 10 of the lending banks capital stock and surplus and as to the corporation and all such nonbank affiliates in the aggregate to 20 of such lending banks capital stock and surplus these restrictions are also applied to transactions between banks and their financial subsidiaries furthermore these transactions must be on terms and conditions that are or in good faith would be offered to nonaffiliated companies ie at arms length  the doddfrank act generally enhances the restrictions on transactions with affiliates under sections 23a and 23b of the federal reserve act including an expansion of the definition of covered transactions to include credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered credit transactions must be satisfied the definition of affiliate was expanded to include any investment fund to which the corporation or an affiliate serves as an investment adviser the ability of the federal reserve board to grant exemptions from these restrictions was also narrowed including by requiring coordination with other bank regulators in addition the provision in section 23a that had permitted a bank to engage in covered transactions with a financial subsidiary of the bank in an amount greater than 10 but less than 20 of the banks capital and surplus has been eliminated  the restrictions on loans to directors executive officers principal stockholders and their related interests collectively referred to herein as insiders contained in the federal reserve act and regulation o apply to all federally insured institutions these restrictions include among others limits on loans to one borrower and conditions that must be met before such a loan can be made there is also an aggregate limitation on all loans including credit exposures related to derivatives repurchase agreements and securities lending arrangements to insiders and their related interests these loans cannot exceed the institutions total unimpaired capital and surplus and the fdic may determine that a lesser amount is appropriate insiders are subject to enforcement actions for knowingly accepting loans in violation of applicable restrictions the doddfrank act enhanced these restrictions and also imposed restrictions on the purchase or sale of assets between banking institutions and insiders  antimoney laundering antiterrorism legislation and office of foreign assets control  under federal law including the bank secrecy act the usa patriot act and the international money laundering abatement and antiterrorist financing act financial institutions including insured depository institutions brokerdealers and certain other financial institutions must maintain antimoney laundering programs that include established internal policies procedures and controls a designated compliance officer an ongoing employee training program and testing of the program by an independent audit function financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and client identification in their dealings with nonus financial institutions and nonus clients financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions and law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and they must consider an institutions compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications including applications for banking mergers and acquisitions the regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and civil money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations    12    table of contents the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for requiring that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress ofac publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons if the corporation or the bank finds a name on any transaction account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list the corporation or the bank must freeze or block such account or transaction file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities  many other countries have imposed similar laws and regulations that apply to the corporations nonus offices the corporation has established policies and procedures to comply with these laws and the related regulations in all relevant jurisdictions  deposit insurance and assessments  the banks deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic the doddfrank act makes permanent the general 250000 deposit insurance limit for insured deposits  fdicinsured depository institutions are required to pay deposit insurance assessments to the fdic the amount of a particular institutions deposit insurance assessment is based on that institutions risk classification under an fdic riskbased assessment system an institutions risk classification is assigned based on the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to the regulators the institutions capital levels and other risk measures  the doddfrank act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif from 115 to 135 of the estimated amount of total insured deposits effective september 30 2020 eliminated the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the fdic each year and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds on december 14 2010 the fdic raised the minimum designated reserve ratio of the dif to 2 where it remains today the ratio is higher than the minimum reserve ratio of 135 as set by the doddfrank act  the fdic has implemented a revised rule on assessments dividends assessment base and large bank pricing the final rule mandated by the doddfrank act changes the deposit insurance assessment system from one that is based on domestic deposits to one that is based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity because the new assessment base under the doddfrank act is larger than the prior assessment base the rules assessment rates are lower than the previous rates which achieves the fdics goal of not significantly altering the total amount of revenue collected from the industry in addition the rule adopts a scorecard assessment scheme for larger banks and suspends dividend payments if the dif reserve ratio exceeds 15 but provides for decreasing assessment rates when the dif reserve ratio reaches certain thresholds the rule further reduces the assessment base for custodial banks by the daily or weekly average of a certain amount of lowrisk assets ie assets with a basel risk weighting of 0 regardless of maturity plus 50 of assets with a basel risk weighting of 20 again regardless of maturity subject to the limitation that the daily or weekly average value of these assets cannot exceed the daily or weekly average value of those deposits classified as transaction accounts and identified by the institution as being directly linked to a fiduciary or custodial and safekeeping account the rule identifies custodial banks as insured depository institutions with previous calendar yearend trust assets ie fiduciary and custody and safekeeping assets of at least 50 billion or those insured depository institutions that derived more than 50 of their revenue interest income plus noninterest income from trust activity over the previous calendar year under the rule the bank will pay slightly lower assessments to the dif than under the previous system  continued action by the fdic to replenish the dif as well as the changes contained in the doddfrank act may result in higher assessment rates which could reduce the profitability of or otherwise negatively impact the bank    13    table of contents interstate banking and branching  the doddfrank act amends the bhca to require a bank holding company seeking approval to acquire shares of a bank located outside of the bank holding companys home state to be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged similarly the doddfrank act amends the bank merger act to require that the surviving bank in an interstate merger transaction be wellcapitalized and wellmanaged  in addition national banks and state banks with different home states are permitted to merge across state lines with the approval of the appropriate federal banking agency unless the home state of a participating banking institution passed legislation prior to june 1 1997 that expressly prohibits interstate mergers the doddfrank act permits a national bank or a state bank with the approval of its regulator to open a branch in any state if the law of the state in which the branch is to be located would permit the establishment of the branch if the bank were a bank chartered in that state  community reinvestment act  the bank is subject to the cra the cra and the regulations issued thereunder are intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderate income neighborhoods consistent with the safe and sound operations of the banks these regulations also provide for regulatory assessment of a banks record in meeting the needs of its service area when considering applications to establish branches merger applications and applications to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of another bank federal banking agencies are required to make public the rating of a banks performance under the cra in the case of a bank holding company the cra performance record of its bank subsidiaries is reviewed by federal banking agencies in connection with the filing of an application to acquire ownership or control of shares or assets of a bank or thrift or to merge with any other bank holding company an unsatisfactory record can substantially delay or block the transaction the bank received an outstanding cra rating from its regulator in its most recent cra examination  in october 2012 the federal reserve board the federal regulator responsible for monitoring the banks cra compliance approved the designation of the bank as a wholesale bank as a result of this redesignation the bank now fulfills its cra obligations by making qualified investments for the purposes of community development rather than retail cra loans  in addition federal law requires the disclosure of agreements reached with community groups that relate to the cra and contains various other provisions designed to improve the delivery of financial services to consumers while maintaining an appropriate level of safety in the financial services industry as of december 31 2013 the bank is not a party to any such agreements  privacy and security  federal law establishes a minimum federal standard of financial privacy by among other provisions requiring financial institutions to adopt and disclose privacy policies with respect to consumer information and setting forth certain limitations on disclosure to third parties of consumer information the corporation has adopted and disseminated its privacy policies pursuant to law regulations adopted under the federal law set standards for protecting the security confidentiality and integrity of client information and require notice to regulators and in some cases to clients in the event of security breaches a number of states have adopted their own statutes concerning financial privacy and security and requiring notification of security breaches  consumer laws and regulations  in addition to the laws and regulations discussed above the corporations banking subsidiaries are also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with clients and monitor account activity when taking deposits making loans to or engaging in other types of transactions with such clients failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to    14    table of contents  substantial penalties operating restrictions and reputational damage to the financial institution the creation of the cfpb by the doddfrank act is likely to lead to enhanced and strengthened enforcement of consumer financial protection laws  many states and local jurisdictions have consumer protection laws analogous and in addition to those listed above  money market mutual funds  on june 5 2013 the sec proposed a rule regarding money market mutual funds mmmf reform the sec proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform either requiring mmmfs to transact at a floating net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a mmmfs liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions the comment period for these alternative proposals closed on september 17 2013 no final rule has been issued to date because of the uncertainty as to whether the sec will issue final rules

factors  from an investors standpoint public companies in general and financial institutions in particular share many of the same risks however each companys unique combination of strategies markets served product and service offerings processes and systems and other internal and external factors cause it to have its own set of principal risks following is a description of some of the principal risks inherent in northern trusts business    29    table of contents we explain below that many of the risks we discuss can reduce our earnings as a result of recognizing losses or otherwise you should understand that significant reductions in earnings can have further negative effects on us in addition to reducing the price of our common stock and other securities such as reducing our capital which can have regulatory and other consequences affecting the confidence that clients and counterparties have in us with a resulting negative effect on our ability to conduct and grow our businesses and reducing the attractiveness of our securities to rating agencies and potential purchasers and so affecting our ability to raise capital and secure other funding or the prices at which we are able to do so  we identify and manage risk through our business strategies and plans and our risk management practices and controls if we fail to successfully identify and manage significant risks we could incur financial loss we may also suffer damage to our reputation that would restrict our ability to grow or conduct business profitably or become subject to regulatory penalties or constraints that would limit some of our activities or make them significantly more expensive  economic market and monetary policy risks  northern trust carries on a global business changes in conditions in the global financial markets and general economic conditions could adversely affect northern trusts businesses factors such as the level and volatility of equity and futures prices the overall pace of capital markets activities interest rates currency exchange rates investor sentiment and inflation or deflation can affect our results           a downturn in economic conditions such as the recent severe global economic downturn can negatively affect our earnings           economic weakness can affect the ability of borrowers to repay loans causing credit quality to deteriorate and resulting in increased cost of credit a higher level of chargeoffs and higher provision for credit losses all of which reduce our earnings           economic weakness can also reduce the fees we earn for managing and servicing our clients assets for example the recent downturn in equity markets and the decrease in the value of some debtrelated investments as a result of market disruption or illiquidity reduce the valuations of the assets we manage or service for others this reduces our earnings since a significant part of the fees we earn is based on asset values           weak economic conditions also affect wealth creation investment preferences trading activities and savings patterns which impact demand for our trust and investment products and services reduced transaction volumes would also negatively impact our earnings           a slowing of the globalization of investment activity or pension reform could limit our revenue growth we believe we have profited from the increasing globalization of investment activity and from pension reform in many nations that has generated new pools of assets that require management and servicing any slowing or reversal of this globalization of financial activity and markets or other such trends would adversely affect factors that have been important in northern trusts growth            uncertainty about the financial stability of several countries in the eu the increasing risk that those countries may default on their sovereign debt and related stresses on financial markets could have a significant adverse effect on our earnings risks and ongoing concerns about the debt crisis in europe could have a detrimental impact on the global economic recovery sovereign and nonsovereign debt in these countries and the financial condition of european financial institutions european market and economic disruptions have affected and may continue to affect consumer confidence levels and spending personal bankruptcy rates levels of incurrence and default on consumer debt and home prices continuing economic challenges in europe and the related disruptions may negatively impact our earnings see the    30    table of contents       section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned asset quality and credit risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4047           instability disruption or a lack of confidence in the political economic legal or regulatory systems of the emerging markets in which we operate could expose us to liability or loss northern trusts expanding business activities in emerging markets including investments made for clients in those markets present risks inherent in conducting these activities in less mature and often less regulated business and investment environments           changes in interest rates can negatively affect our earnings the direction and level of interest rates are important factors in our earnings rates that remain persistently low may reduce our net interest margin which is the difference between what we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funding a low interest rate environment can also reduce fees earned on certain of our products for example during 20092013 we waived certain fees associated with money market mutual funds due to the low level of shortterm interest rates lower net interest margins and fee waivers negatively impact our earnings see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementinterest rate risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4749           volatility levels and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our earnings periods of lower foreign currency volatility can result in reduced foreign exchange trading income we hold various nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities and maintain investments in nonus subsidiaries we also provide foreign exchange services to our clients primarily in connection with our global custody business and effect other transactions in nonus dollar currencies foreign currency volatility and fluctuations in exchange rates may impact the value of nonus dollar denominated assets investments and cash flows and raise the potential for losses resulting from foreign currency trading positions where aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the us dollar do not offset each other or offset each other in different time periods if the policies and procedures we have in place to assess and mitigate potential impacts of foreign exchange volatility including hedgingrelated strategies are not followed or are not effective to mitigate such risks our results and earnings may be negatively affected see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementforeign currency risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4950           declines in the value of securities held in our investment portfolio can negatively affect our earnings the value of securities available for sale and held to maturity within our investment portfolio may fluctuate as a result of market volatility and economic or financial market conditions generally the fair value of those securities is determined based upon market values available from third party sources the recent period of economic turmoil and financial market disruption has negatively affected the liquidity and pricing of securities generally and assetbacked and auction rate securities in particular to the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities results from declines in securities values that management determines to be otherthantemporary the book value of those securities will be adjusted to their estimated recovery value and we will recognize a charge to earnings in the quarter during which we make that determination see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned risk managementasset quality and credit risk managementsecurities portfolio in the 2013 annual report to stockholders page 40 and note 4securities in the notes to consolidated financial statements pages 7579 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for additional information            changes in a number of particular market conditions can negatively affect our earnings in past periods reductions in the volatility of currency trading markets the level of crossborder investing activity or the demand for borrowing securities or willingness to lend such securities have negatively affected our earnings from activities such as foreign exchange trading and securities lending if these conditions occur in the future our earnings from these activities may be negatively affected in a few of our businesses such    31    table of contents       as securities lending our fee is calculated as a percentage of our clients earnings so that market and other factors that reduce our clients earnings from investments or trading activities also reduce our revenues the recent extraordinary market conditions have produced losses in some securities lending programs such market conditions also have reduced borrower demand and led some clients to withdraw from these programs a persistence or worsening of these conditions could result in additional withdrawals and decreased activity see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned offbalance sheet arrangementsvariable interests in the 2013 annual report to stockholders page 32 and note 28variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements pages 110111 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for additional information           changes in the monetary and other policies of the various regulatory authorities or central banks of the united states nonus governments and international agencies can reduce our earnings and negatively affect our growth prospects for example the board of governors of the federal reserve system regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states and its policies determine in large part the level of interest rates and our cost of funds for lending and investing changes in interest rates and our cost of funds can negatively affect earnings the actions of the federal reserve board can reduce the value of financial instruments we hold its policies also can affect our borrowers by increasing interest rates or making sources of funding less available this can increase the risk that they may fail to repay their loans from us           failure to develop and implement contingency plans to address market disruptions could adversely affect us our success in the area of highly complex asset servicing relationships depends in part on our development and successful implementation of contingency plans to address significant market disruptions caused by bankruptcy insolvency or illiquidity if we fail to develop or successfully implement contingency plans for these market disruptions our results and business may be negatively affected           governmental action to combat economic weakness and financial market disruption may not succeed and may otherwise negatively affect us since mid2008 there have been unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit in response to these developments the us and other governments have taken steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular the upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of the risks identified above and magnified their potential effect on northern trust to the extent that these governmental stabilization and mitigation activities are not successful or adversely change the competitive structure of the financial services industry these developments could have an adverse impact on northern trusts revenues costs credit losses access to capital and liquidity they also may impose additional limitations or costs on northern trusts business  operational risks           errors breakdowns in controls or other mistakes in the provision of services to clients or in carrying out transactions for our own account can subject us to liability result in losses or negatively affect our earnings in other ways in our asset servicing investment management fiduciary administration and other business activities northern trust effects or processes transactions for clients and for itself that involve very large amounts of money failure to properly manage or mitigate operational risks can have adverse consequences and increased volatility in the financial markets may increase the magnitude of resulting losses           many types of operational risks can negatively affect our earnings many factors can impact operations and expose us to risks that may vary in size scale and scope including           human errors or omissions including failures to comply with applicable laws or corporate policies and procedures    32    table of contents        theft fraud or misappropriation of assets whether arising from the intentional actions of internal personnel or external third parties           defects or interruptions in computer or communications systems           breakdowns in processes including manual processes which are inherently more prone to error than automated processes overreliance on manual processes breakdowns in internal controls or failures of the technology and facilities that support our operations           unsuccessful or difficult implementation of computer systems upgrades           defects in product design or delivery           difficulty in accurately pricing assets which can be aggravated by increased asset coverage market volatility and illiquidity and lack of reliable pricing from vendors           negative developments in relationships with key counterparties vendors employees or associates in our daytoday operations and           external events that are wholly or partially beyond our control such as natural disasters epidemics computer viruses geopolitical events political unrest or acts of terrorism           our dependence on technology exposes us to risks that also can result in losses automated systems to record and process transactions as well as to monitor positions and price assets reduce the risk of human error but our necessary dependence on such systems also increases the risk that system flaws or manipulation of those systems will result in losses the failure to upgrade systems as necessary to support growth and changing business needs also could have a material adverse effect on our operations additionally failure to ensure adequate review and consideration of critical business changes prior to and during introduction and deployment of key technological systems or failure to adequately align evolving client commitments and expectations with operational capabilities can have a negative impact on our operations           breaches of our security measures can result in losses we rely heavily on information technology to conduct our business and any failure interruption or breach in the security of our systems could severely disrupt our operations our systems involve the use of clients and northern trusts proprietary information and security breaches including cyberattacks could expose us to a risk of loss of this information litigation and potential liability our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties employee error malfeasance or otherwise and as a result an unauthorized party may obtain access our clients proprietary information or our own proprietary information for example outside parties may attempt to use social engineering schemes such as phishing to manipulate employees or clients into disclosing sensitive information information security risks for large financial institutions like us are significant in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists and other external parties including foreign state actors because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed our reputation could suffer and we could lose clients    33    table of contents        we may fail to detect errors resulting in losses that continue until the problems are detected and fixed given the high volume of transactions we process errors that affect earnings may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and corrected           our business continuity plans may not work and thus fail to prevent losses from operational failures our business continuity plans address many of these risks but may not operate successfully to mitigate them if they do not we could incur losses liability to clients or others and reduced earnings           inability of our internal controls to keep pace with our expansion may result in losses in recent years we have expanded our geographic footprint product pipeline and client types a failure to put controls in place to mitigate new risks associated with this expansion may disrupt our operations resulting in losses           failure of any of our third party vendors to perform can result in losses third party vendors provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access while we have established risk management processes and continuity plans any disruptions in service from a key vendor for any reason or poor performance of services could negatively affect our ability to deliver products and services to our clients and conduct our business replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense           northern trusts reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss or disclosure of our clients or our own information northern trust makes extensive use of online services and centralized data processing including through third party service providers the secure maintenance and transmission of client information is a critical element of our operations our information technology and other systems that maintain and transmit client information or those of service providers or business partners may be impacted by advertent or inadvertent actions or inactions by our employees or those of a third party service provider or business partner as a result northern trusts clients information may be lost disclosed accessed or taken without the clients consent any such loss disclosure or access to clients information can result in legal claims or legal proceedings including regulatory investigations and actions may have a serious impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our businesses operating results and financial condition  these risks are magnified as client requirements become more complex and as our increasingly international business requires endtoend management of operational and other processes across multiple time zones and many interrelated products and services  see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned market risk managementoperational risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 5051  investment performance fiduciary and asset servicing risks  revenues from our investment management fiduciary and asset servicing businesses are significant to our earnings           failure to produce adequate and competitive returns can negatively affect our earnings and growth prospects if we do not generate competitive riskadjusted returns that satisfy clients in a variety of asset classes we will have greater difficulty maintaining existing business and attracting new business which would negatively affect our earnings and prospects           if we fail to comply with legal standards we could incur liability to our clients or lose clients which could negatively affect our earnings managing or servicing assets with reasonable prudence in accordance with the terms of governing documents and applicable laws is important to client satisfaction which in turn is important to the earnings and growth of our investment businesses failure to comply with these standards adequately manage these risks or manage the differing interests often involved in the exercise of fiduciary responsibilities could also result in liability           we may take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings we may find it appropriate to take action or incur expenses in order to maintain client satisfaction or preserve the usefulness of investments or investment vehicles we manage in light of changes in security ratings liquidity or valuation issues or other developments even though we are not required to do so by law or the terms of governing instruments the risk that we will decide to take actions to maintain client satisfaction that result in losses or reduced earnings is greater in periods when credit or equity markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile and liquidity in markets is disrupted    34    table of contents credit risks  a number of northern trusts product offerings involve credit risk which is the risk that other parties will not fulfill their financial obligations to us these product offerings include loans leases derivatives foreign exchange and other credit commitments           failure to evaluate accurately the prospects for repayment when we extend credit or maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses can result in losses or the need to make additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings we evaluate credit commitments before we make them and then provide for credit risks based on our assessment of the credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio including undrawn credit commitments this process requires us to make difficult and complex judgments challenges associated with our credit risk assessments include identifying the proper factors to be used in assessment and accurately estimating the impacts of those factors allowances that prove to be inadequate can directly and negatively affect earnings           weakened economic conditions can result in losses or the need for additional provisions for credit losses both of which reduce our earnings credit risk levels and our earnings can also be affected by the strength of the economy in general and in the particular locales in which we extend credit a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit and adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our borrowers which could impact the borrowers abilities to repay outstanding loans for a fuller discussion of the allowance and provision for credit losses for 2013 2012 and 2011 see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned asset quality and credit risk management in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 4047           the failure or instability of any of our significant counterparties could expose us to loss the financial markets are characterized by extensive interconnections among financial institutions including banks brokerdealers collective investment funds and insurance companies as a result of these interconnections we and many of our clients have significant counterparty exposure to other financial institutions this counterparty exposure presents significant risks to us and to our clients because the failure or perceived weakness of any of our counterparties or in some cases of our clients counterparties has the potential to expose us to risk of loss the recent instability of the financial markets has resulted in many financial institutions becoming significantly less creditworthy and as a result we are exposed to increased counterparty risks both as principal and in our capacity as agent for our clients changes in market perception of the financial strength of particular financial institutions can occur rapidly is often based upon a variety of factors and is difficult to predict in addition as us and nonus governments have addressed the financial crisis in an evolving manner the criteria for and manner of governmental support of financial institutions and other economically important sectors remain uncertain if a significant individual counterparty defaults on an obligation to us we could incur financial losses that materially adversely affect our business our financial condition and our results of operations given the limited number of strong counterparties in the current market we are not able to mitigate all of our and our clients counterparty credit risk the consolidation of financial service firms and the failures of other financial institutions have increased the concentration of our counterparty risk    35    table of contents liquidity risks  northern trust depends on access to capital markets and shortterm funding to provide sufficient capital resources and other funds to meet our commitments and business needs and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients           many events or circumstances could adversely affect our capital costs our ability to raise capital and in turn our ability to meet our commitments inadequate capital or the inability to meet our commitments could cause us to incur liability restrict our ability to grow or require us to take actions that would negatively affect our earnings among the developments that could have this effect are           a loss of confidence of debt purchasers depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets generally or in transactions with northern trust           disruption in the market for debtrelated securities and           a significant downgrade of any of our debt ratings credit agencies ratings can change and they often adjust their methodology credit ratings and outlooks are opinions on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities including longterm debt shortterm borrowings preferred stock and other securities including asset securitizations our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and thus may change from time to time based on a number of factors including our own financial strength performance prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control such as ratings agencyspecific criteria or frameworks for our industry or certain security types which are subject to revision from time to time and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally a significant downgrade in northern trusts debt ratings could increase the costs and availability of short and longterm funding negatively impacting our profitability and our ability to meet client needs           our success with large complex clients requires substantial liquidity our failure to successfully manage these liquidity and balance sheet issues would have a negative impact on our ability to meet client needs and grow           if the bank or the other subsidiaries of the corporation were unable to supply the corporation with funds over time the corporation could be unable to meet its various obligations the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank and its other subsidiaries the corporation relies primarily on dividends paid to it by the bank to meet its obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders of the corporation there are various legal limitations on the extent to which the bank and the other subsidiaries can supply funds to the corporation by dividend or otherwise see regulation and supervision in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k  see the section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations captioned liquidity and capital resources in the 2013 annual report to stockholders pages 3239 including the discussion of the possible negative effects of a significant downgrade of any of the corporations debt ratings page 34  regulation risks  virtually every aspect of northern trusts business around the world is regulated generally by governmental agencies that have broad supervisory powers and the ability to impose sanctions in the united states the corporation the bank and many of the corporations other subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels these regulations cover a variety of matters ranging from required capital levels to prohibited activities they are specifically directed at protecting depositors the federal deposit insurance fund and the banking system as a whole not security holders the corporation and its subsidiaries are also heavily regulated by bank securities and other regulators globally    36    table of contents        failure to comply with regulations can result in penalties and regulatory constraints that restrict our ability to grow or even conduct our business or that reduce earnings regulatory violations or failure to meet formal or informal commitments made to regulators could generate penalties require corrective actions that increase costs of conducting business result in limitations on our ability to conduct business restrict our ability to expand or adversely impact our reputation failure to obtain necessary approvals from regulatory agencies on a timely basis could adversely affect proposed business opportunities and results of operations in the ordinary course of our business we are also subject to various regulatory governmental and enforcement inquiries investigations and subpoenas these may be directed generally to participants in the businesses in which we are involved or may be specifically directed at us in enforcement matters claims for disgorgement the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and the imposition of other remedial sanctions are possible           the ongoing implementation of the doddfrank act may have a material effect on our operations the doddfrank act which was signed into law on july 21 2010 made a number of significant regulatory and compliance changes such as           changes to the bank and bank holding company supervisory structure           changes to regulatory capital requirements           creation of new government regulatory agencies           limitation and prohibition of certain activities by the volcker rule           changes in insured depository institution regulations and           mortgage loan origination and risk retention  there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the manner in which the provisions of the doddfrank act will be implemented by the various regulatory agencies and the full extent of the impact of the requirements on our operations is unclear the changes resulting from the doddfrank act may impact the profitability of our business activities require changes to certain of our business practices impose upon us more stringent capital liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business these changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements failure to comply with the new requirements or with any future changes in laws or regulations may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition for a more detailed description of the doddfrank act see businessregulation and supervisionthe doddfrank act           changes in regulatory capital requirements could result in reduced earnings the doddfrank act and the implementation of basel iii have led to significantly higher capital requirements higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios and could impact the capital allocations to various business activities the ultimate impact of the evolving capital and liquidity standards on us will depend on a number of factors including the interpretation and implementation of capital and leverage requirements by the us banking regulators            compliance with evolving laws and regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict laws regulations economic sanctions and their interpretation by regulatory agencies may change or generate enhanced scrutiny of particular activities those changes or enhanced emphasis can impose costs or otherwise affect our ability to compete successfully as noted above the doddfrank act will impose many new regulatory requirements on banking institutions the full impacts of which are difficult to determine at this time it is expected that additional legislative or regulatory requirements will continue to be imposed in the us and in other countries and existing legislative or regulatory requirements may be reinterpreted in the us or in other countries in each case in a way that may have an adverse impact on our business activities our costs of    37    table of contents       compliance and our revenues and earnings additionally our understanding of legislative or regulatory requirements might be different than the enforcers understanding of the regulations moreover many regulatory initiatives including antimoney laundering rules antibribery laws home mortgage lending and loan modification requirements and other regulatory requirements or priorities could increase compliance costs and legal risks and could lead to financial and reputational damage in the event of a violation while we have programs in place including policies training and various forms of monitoring designed to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatory requirements these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees the full scope and impact of possible enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulation is uncertain and difficult to predict           potential additional regulation of money market mutual funds mmmf could lower the desirability of mmmfs for investors and reduce the profitability of mmmf sponsors on june 5 2013 the sec issued a proposed rule regarding mmmf reform the sec proposal set forth two alternative methods of reform either requiring mmmfs to transact at a floating net asset value per share or imposing a liquidity fee if a mmmfs liquidity level fell below a specified threshold and permitting a fund to temporarily suspend redemptions the comment period for these alternative proposals closed on september 17 2013 and no final rule has been issued to date because of the uncertainty as to whether the sec will issue final rules and what the final rules will require the corporation and the bank cannot fully evaluate such reforms impact to their business at this time           the federal reserve board frb policies on interest rates can significantly affect business and economic conditions and our financial results and condition the frbs policies determine in large part our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we earn on those loans and investments both of which affect our net interest income and net interest margin as a result of the frbs concerns regarding among other things continued slow economic growth and a weak housing market the frb recently indicated that it intends to keep the target range for the federal funds rate near zero until unemployment levels and inflation are under control the frb also may increase its purchases of us government and mortgagebacked securities or take other actions in an effort to reduce or maintain low longterm interest rates  see regulation and supervision in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k  litigation risks  our businesses involve the risk that clients or others may sue us claiming that we have failed to perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry out a duty owed to them our trust custody and investment management businesses are particularly subject to this risk this risk may be heightened during periods when credit equity or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or are particularly volatile or when clients or investors are experiencing losses in addition as a publiclyheld company we are subject to the risk of claims under the federal securities laws and volatility in the stock prices of northern trust and other financial institutions increases this risk           litigation can result in significant liability or damage to our reputation which could result in a loss even where we defend ourselves successfully the cost of litigation is often substantial even claims made against us without merit may cause damage to our reputation among existing and prospective clients or negatively impact the confidence of counterparties rating agencies and stockholders and so negatively affect our earnings           we may fail to set aside adequate reserves or otherwise underestimate our liability with a negative effect on our earnings we estimate our potential liability for pending and threatened claims and record reserves when appropriate pursuant to us gaap by evaluating the facts of particular claims under current judicial decisions and legislative and regulatory interpretations this process is inherently subject to risk including the risks that a judge or jury could decide a case contrary to our evaluation of the law or the facts or that a court could change or modify existing law on a particular issue important to the case earnings will be adversely affected to the extent that our reserves are not adequate    38    table of contents see note 24contingent liabilities in the notes to consolidated financial statements pages 101102 in the 2013 annual report to stockholders for a discussion of current legal proceedings and litigationrelated financial reserves  tax risks  in the course of its business northern trust is sometimes subject to challenges from us and nonus tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due           these challenges can result in reduced earnings in a number of ways these challenges may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions all of which can require a greater provision for taxes or otherwise negatively affect earnings           changes in tax laws and interpretations can negatively affect our earnings both us and nonus tax authorities from time to time issue new or modify existing tax laws and regulations these authorities may also issue new or modify existing interpretations of those laws and regulations these new laws regulations or interpretations and the corporations actions taken in response to or reliance upon such changes in the tax laws may impact the corporations tax position in a manner that results in lower earnings  accounting risks           changes in accounting standards may be difficult to predict and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements new accounting standards or changes to existing accounting standards resulting both from initiatives of the financial accounting standards board or their convergence efforts with the international accounting standards board as well as changes in the interpretation of existing accounting standards by the financial accounting standards board the sec or bank regulatory agencies or otherwise reflected in us generally accepted accounting principles potentially could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations these changes are difficult to predict and in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in the revised treatment of certain transactions or activities or even the restatement of consolidated financial statements for prior periods  strategic and competitive risks  we have grown through a combination of organic growth and the acquisition of selected businesses or capabilities and we intend to continue to do so a variety of risks could interfere with these plans           if we do not successfully execute strategic plans we will not grow as we have planned and our earnings growth will be negatively impacted our growth depends upon successful consistent execution of our business strategies in each business unit a failure to execute these strategies will negatively impact growth a failure to grow organically or to successfully integrate a substantial acquisition would have an adverse effect on our business the challenges arising from generating organic growth or the integration of an acquired business may include preserving valuable relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners delivering enhanced products and services as well as combining accounting data processing and internal control systems           failure to adequately control our costs could negatively affect our ability to compete and thus reduce our earnings our success in controlling the costs and expenses of our business operations also impacts operating results another goal of innovation as a part of our business strategy is to produce efficiencies in operations that help reduce and control costs and expenses including the costs of losses associated with operating risks attributable to servicing and managing financial assets    39    table of contents        failure to attract and retain skilled people could negatively affect our prospects our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain key talent competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire and retain key personnel including as a result of any restrictions on our compensation practices that may be imposed by governments or regulators the unexpected loss of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills knowledge of our market years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel           we face a variety of competitive challenges that could negatively affect our ability to maintain satisfactory prices and grow our earnings we provide a broad range of financial products and services in highly competitive markets in which pricing can be a key competitive factor merger activity in the financial services industry including mergers resulting from government intervention and the overall disruption in the financial services industry continues to produce large in some cases wellcapitalized and geographicallydiverse companies that are capable of offering a wide array of financial products and services at competitive prices in certain businesses such as foreign exchange trading electronic networks present a competitive challenge additionally technological advances and the growth of internetbased commerce have made it possible for nondepository institutions to offer a variety of products and services competitive with certain areas of our business many of these nontraditional service providers have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures these competitive pressures can negatively affect earnings and our ability to grow           intervention of the us and other governments in the financial services industry may heighten the challenges we face in response to disruptions in global financial markets the us government and other governments around the world have taken and may take further unprecedented actions designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular for example the doddfrank act among other things created a consumer financial protection bureau with broad powers to regulate consumer financial services and products and a financial stability oversight council with regulatory authority over certain financial companies and activities governments also may take actions to significantly change the way financial institutions are regulated either through new legislation new regulations new applications of existing regulations or a combination of all of these methods these actions may involve increased intervention by such governments and regulators in the normal operation of our businesses and the businesses of our competitors in the financial services industry such intervention may impact the nature and level of competition in the industry in unpredictable ways the nature pace and volume of this government intervention and our ability to react in a timely manner to regulatory developments may adversely impact our ability to compete successfully and in turn negatively affect our earnings           we need to constantly invest in innovation and the inability or failure to do so will negatively affect our businesses and earnings our success in this competitive environment requires consistent investment of capital and human resources in innovation this investment is directed at generating new products and services and adapting existing products and services to the evolving standards and demands of the marketplace among other things investing in innovation helps us maintain a mix of products and services that keeps pace with our competitors and achieve acceptable margins this investment also focuses on enhancing the delivery of our products and services in order to compete successfully for new clients or gain additional business from existing clients and includes investment in technological innovation as well effectively identifying gaps or weaknesses in our product offerings also is important falling behind our competition in any of these areas could adversely affect our business opportunities growth and earnings           failure to understand or fully appreciate the risks associated with development or delivery of new product and service offerings will negatively affect our businesses and earnings our success in capitalizing on innovation depends in part on successful implementation of new product and service initiatives not only must we keep pace with competitors in the development of these new offerings but we must accurately price them as well as existing products on a riskadjusted basis and effectively deliver them to clients our identification of risks arising from new products and services both in their design and implementation and effective responses to those identified risks including pricing is key to our capitalizing on innovation and investment in new product and service offerings           our success with large complex clients requires understanding of the market and legal regulatory and accounting standards in new jurisdictions any failure to understand and deal with those appropriately could affect our growth prospects or negatively affect our reputation    40    table of contents see competition in item 1 of this annual report on form 10k  reputation risks  an important reason that clients bring their business to northern trust is that they believe we will serve them with high standards of ethics performance accuracy and compliance           damage to our reputation can have a direct and negative effect on our ability to compete grow and generate revenue damage to our reputation for delivery of a high level of service undermines the confidence of clients and prospects in our ability to serve them and so negatively affects our earnings           maintaining our reputation is important in other key relationships that affect our businesses and our earnings damage to our reputation also could affect the confidence of clients rating agencies regulators stockholders and the other parties in a wide range of transactions that are important to our business failure to maintain our reputation would ultimately have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our balance sheet or grow our business           reputation risk has many facets that could negatively affect our businesses and earnings reputational risk is particularly significant in the current environment resulting from the financial crisis the maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in controlling or mitigating the various risks described above but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in a broad range of areas these issues include potential conflicts of interest and other ethical issues antimoney laundering and antiterrorist financing procedures client personal information and privacy issues effective evaluation of talent and deployment to adequately address complex and rapid growing areas of our businesses efficiently integrating current staff with their new responsibilities and new staff that are not as familiar with the organization as seamlessly as possible data security recordkeeping regulatory investigations of northern trust or within the banking industry and any litigation that arises from the failure or perceived failure of northern trust to comply with legal and regulatory requirements  many of the risks described above are discussed in more detail in the 2013 annual
