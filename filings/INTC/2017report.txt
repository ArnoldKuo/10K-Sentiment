materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the related noteschanges in product demand can adversely affect our financial resultsdemand for our products is variable and hard to predict changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down the value of our assets our platform products are used across different market segments and demand for our platforms may vary within or among our client computing data center internet of things and other market segments it is difficult to anticipate the impact of these changes as demand may increase in one or more market segments while decreasing in others important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes inbusiness conditions including downturns in the computing industry or in the global or regional economiesconsumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions including changes in government borrowing taxation or spending policies the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity pricesthe level of our customers inventoriescompetitive and pricing pressures including actions taken by competitorscustomer product needsmarket acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products andthe technology supply chain including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other eventswe face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we do not anticipate and respond to these developments our competitive position may weaken and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete additionally a number of business combinations including mergers asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several years and more could occur in the future consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customers partners or suppliers any of which could negatively affect our financial results in recent years our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms and other products for the data center internet of things and memory market segments including fpga products connectivity products and a number of other products and services for a wide range of connected devices as a result we face new sources of competition including in certain of these market segments from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions despite our ongoing efforts there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments15table of contentsto compete successfully we must maintain a successful rampd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rampd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers our rampd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our productsif we are not able to compete effectively our financial results will be adversely affected including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the writedown of the value of certain assets changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results our pricing and margins vary across our products and market segments due to differences in product features or manufacturing costs for example our platform product offerings range from lowerpriced and entrylevel platforms such as those based on intel quark or intel atom processors to higherend platforms based on intel xeon processors if demand shifts from our higherpriced to lowerpriced platforms in any of our market segments our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross marginwe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictionsglobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have manufacturing assembly and test rampd sales and other operations in many countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas moreover sales outside the us accounted for approximately 78 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016 as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control includingglobal and local economic conditionsgeopolitical and security issues such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest crime political instability human rights concerns and terrorist activitynatural disasters public health issues and other catastrophic eventsinefficient infrastructure and other disruptions such as supply chain interruptions and largescale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providersgovernment restrictions on or nationalization of our operations in any country or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular countrydiffering employment practices and labor issues formal or informal imposition of new or revised export andor import and doingbusiness regulations including trade sanctions and tariffs which could be changed without noticeineffective legal protection of our ip rights in certain countries local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices andincreased uncertainty regarding social political immigration and trade policies in the us and abroad such as recent us legislation and policies and the united kingdoms referendum to withdraw from the european union brexitwe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide which may differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition advertising employment product regulations environment health and safety requirements and consumer laws compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers andor agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation16table of contentswe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial conditioncatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters industrial accidents geopolitical conditions terrorist activity public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers receive production materials from our suppliers or perform critical functions which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions in addition one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial conditionwe are vulnerable to product and manufacturingrelated risks due to the variability in demand for our products and the complexity of our manufacturing operations we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuations in demand our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our costs related to manufacturing such as facility construction and equipment rampd and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciationconversely if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenseswe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production of integrated circuits is a complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the nextgeneration process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks including difficulties in designing and developing nextgeneration process technologies development and production timing delays lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and product defects and errata disruptions in the production process can also result from errors defects in materials delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the results from operations17table of contentswe face supply chain risks thousands of suppliers provide materials and equipment that we use in production and other aspects of our business where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however for certain materials we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location in addition consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the products and services available to us the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs which could harm our business and results of operations our manufacturing operations and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our suppliers where an injunction against intel or a supplier could interrupt the availability of goods or services supplied to intel by otherswe also rely on thirdparty providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products particularly those related to networking mobile and communications programmable semiconductor solutions and nand flash memory if any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely or costeffective basis we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial resultsin addition there are regulatory and other requirements restrictions and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate regulating supplier behaviors and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials but do not directly control their procurement or employment practiceswe are subject to the risks of product defects errata or other product issues product defects and errata deviations from published specifications may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes components and products we purchase or license from thirdparty suppliers or attain through acquisitions may also contain defects we could face risks if products that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defects or errata these risks may increase as our products are introduced into new devices markets technologies or applications through the internet of things including wearables drones and transportation and industrial and consumer uses costs from defects errata or other product issues could includewriting off some or all of the value of inventoryrecalling products that have been shippedproviding product replacements or modifications reimbursing customers for certain costs they incur defending against litigation andor paying resulting damages andpaying fines imposed by regulatory agenciesthese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defects errata or other issues could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product releases or result in legal liability the announcement of product defects or errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial results in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage has certain exclusions andor may not adequately cover liabilities incurred our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim and losses not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial conditionwe are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental health and safety laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result inregulatory penalties fines and legal liabilitiessuspension of productionalteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processesreputational challenges andrestrictions on our operations or sales18table of contentsour failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations such as air quality and wastewater requirements environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processesclimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if for example utility companies pass on their costs to their customers furthermore many of our operations are located in semiarid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change our fabrication facilities require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure we are subject to ip risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedingswe may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights we regard our patents copyrights trade secrets and other ip rights as important to the success of our business we rely on ip law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers employees technology development partners and others to protect our ip rights our ability to enforce these rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we may be subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in rampd product development and marketing could be reducedour licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired19table of contentsthird parties may assert claims based on ip rights against us or our products which could harm our business we may face claims based on ip rights from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others whether or not meritorious could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel in addition we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information or enduser data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them as a result of ip rights claims we couldpay monetary damages including payments to satisfy indemnification obligationsstop manufacturing using selling offering to sell or importing products or technology subject to claims develop other products or technology not subject to claims which could be timeconsuming or costly andorenter into settlement and license agreements which agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable termsthese ip rights claims could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmedwe rely on access to thirdparty ip which may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all many of our products include thirdparty ip andor implement industry standards which may require licenses from third parties based on past experience and industry practice we believe such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms however there is no assurance that the necessary licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or at all failure to obtain the right to use thirdparty ip or to use such ip on commercially reasonable terms could preclude us from selling certain products or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating resultswe are subject to the risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedings we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in note 20 commitments and contingencies in part ii item 8 of this form 10k we are engaged in a number of litigation and regulatory matters litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain and adverse rulings could occur including monetary damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain products engaging in certain business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends in addition regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly timeconsuming disruptive to our operations and distracting to managementwe must attract retain and motivate key employees to be competitive we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists engineers technical staff and sales representatives are critical to our business and competition for experienced employees can be intense to help attract retain and motivate qualified employees we use sharebased and other performancebased incentive awards such as restricted stock units rsus and cash bonuses also key to our employee hiring and retention is our ability to build and maintain an inclusive business culture and be viewed as an employer of choice if our sharebased or other compensation programs and workplace culture cease to be viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employees could be weakened which could harm our results of operations 20table of contentswe are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risksthird parties attempt to gain unauthorized access to our network products services and infrastructure we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our information technology it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide due to the widespread use of our products and the high profile of our commercial security products we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our

access to our network products services or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operations in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempts and attacks against our network products and services and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threats such incidents whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring significant costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties in addition these threats are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and serviceswe may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employees customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceedings the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment costs to comply with and implement these privacyrelated

result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or otherswe are subject to risks associated with transactionswe invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments we make investments in public and private companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives many of the instruments in which we invest are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies in which we invest range from earlystage companies still defining their strategic direction to mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the success of our investment in any company is typically dependent on the availability to the company of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity event such as a public offering or acquisition if any of the companies in which we invest fail we could lose all or part of our investment 21table of contentsour acquisitions divestitures and other transactions could fail to achieve strategic objectives disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussions evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements for possible acquisitions divestitures and other transactions such as joint ventures given that our resources are limited our decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs accordingly if we pursue a particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives in addition to opportunity costs these transactions involve large challenges and risks including risks thatthe transaction may not advance our business strategywe may be unable to identify opportunities on terms

through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors as well as oems odms and internet service providers we depend on many distributors to help us create end customer demand provide technical support and other valueadded services to customers fill customer orders and stock our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and a material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributors for some of our products may be limited in addition our distributors expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory levels for some of our products may not be easily transferable to a new distributor as a result end customers may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of a distributor using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors and other third parties may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products they may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of the foreign corrupt practices act or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failure to manage risks related to our

method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a decline of 30 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 19 billion based on the value as of december 31 2016 a decrease in value of approximately 18 billion based on the value as of december 26 2015 using an assumed decline of 30many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become

quarter fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52week years our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of intel corporation intel and our subsidiaries we have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentationuse of estimatesthe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimatesduring our 2015 annual assessment of the useful lives of our property plant and equipment we determined that the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from 4 to 5 years based on the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14 nanometer nm and 10nm products we have also increased the reuse of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology this change in estimate was applied prospectively effective at the beginning of 2016 during 2016 this change increased our operating income by approximately 13 billion our net income by approximately 950 million and our diluted earnings per share by approximately 019 note 2 accounting policies revenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete as evidenced by an agreement delivery has occurred pricing is deemed fixed and collection is considered probable we record pricing allowances including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer we include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of salesrevenue from license agreements on our mcafee products generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in which services are provided revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period professional services revenue is recognized as services are performed or if required upon customer acceptance for arrangements with multiple elements including software licenses maintenance andor services revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred when vendorspecific objective evidence does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period direct costs such as costs related to revenuesharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions are deferred and recognized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized57table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedinventorieswe compute inventory cost on a firstin firstout basis we apply judgment in the valuation of our inventory which includes the following critical accounting estimates intel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from research and development rampd to cost of sales this impacts the timing of when manufacturing costs can be capitalized as inventory for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications this milestone is known as product release qualification prq we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory prior to prq costs that do not meet the criteria for rampd are included in cost of sales in the period incurred if the point at which we estimate that inventory meets prq criteria changes in the future the timing and recognition of the manufacturing costs would shift between rampd and costs of salesto determine which manufacturing overhead costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine what normal capacity levels are at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity chargesinventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost inventory reserves increased by approximately 270 million in 2016 compared to 2015 the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross marginproperty plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straightline method over the estimated useful life of the assets and we capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capitalrelated government grants earned as a reduction to property plant and equipmentwe apply judgment in the valuation of our property plant and equipment which includes the following critical accounting estimatesthe estimated economic useful lives of our property plant and equipment can materially impact our depreciation expense accordingly at least annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions and reuse of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology we had a change in estimate in 2016 related to the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities for further information see note 1 basis of presentationas we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets new shorter useful lives 58table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedwe assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows arising from the use of that asset grouping if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and its fair valuewe have certain facilities included within construction in progress being held in a safe state and not currently in use that we have plans to place into service at a future date the time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for our products and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap management makes judgments about the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products depreciation is not recognized on these assets and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on holdfair valuefair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value except for cost method investments cost method loans receivable equity method investments grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than three months  the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities we evaluate securityspecific market data when determining whether a market is activelevel 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in less active markets or modelderived valuations all significant inputs used in our valuations such as discounted cash flows are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities we use liborbased yield curves currency spot and forward rates and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations level 2 inputs also include nonbinding market consensus prices as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for securityspecific restrictions when we use nonbinding market consensus prices we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as a discounted cash flow modelslevel 3 unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes level 3 inputs also include nonbinding market consensus prices or nonbinding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market dataour policy is to reflect transfers between the fair value hierarchy levels at the beginning of the period cash equivalentswe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt financial institution instruments government debt and reverse repurchase agreements59table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedtrading assetsmarketable debt instruments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt instrument itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value the gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement are recorded in interest and other net we also designate certain floatingrate securitized financial instruments primarily assetbacked securities as trading

investmentinvestments designated as availableforsale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss except as noted in the otherthantemporary impairment section we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level our availableforsale investments includemarketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met we record the interest income and realized gains or losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other netmarketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification we acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives we record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains losses on equity investments netnonmarketable and other equity investmentswe regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 44 billion as of december 31 2016 45 billion as of december 26 2015our nonmarketable equity and other equity investments are included in other longterm assets we account for nonmarketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee asequity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee equity method investments include marketable and nonmarketable investments our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a onequarter lag and is recorded in gains losses on equity investments netnonmarketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply significant judgment is required to identify whether an impairment exists in the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio and therefore we consider this a critical accounting estimate our quarterly analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have a significant impact on the investees fair value qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding the financial performance and nearterm prospects of the investee changes in general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of comparable financial metrics of private and public companies and recent financing rounds the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue costs and discount rates our assessment of these factors in determining whether an impairment exists could change in the future due to new developments or changes in applied assumptions60table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedotherthantemporary impairmentour availableforsale investments and nonmarketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review impairments affect earnings as followsmarketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument or when it is more likely than not

exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument we separate otherthantemporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses which are recognized in

conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and the business outlook for the investee which may include industry and sector performance changes

objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we may enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple separate derivative transactions we may also enter into collateral security arrangements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds for presentation on our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements our derivative financial instruments are presented at fair value on a gross basis and

investment and financing transactions selected securities may be loaned secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities the loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets for lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability for lending agreements collateralized by other securities we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledgedloans receivablewe may enter into loan transactions with third parties these loans are classified within other current assets or other longterm assets we may elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with a related derivative instrument when the fair value option is not elected the loans are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate62table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedcredit riskfinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments derivative financial instruments loans receivable reverse repurchase agreements and trade receivables we may enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterpartywe generally place investments with highcreditquality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing as required per our investment policy substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investmentgrade instruments creditrating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments due to master netting arrangements the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty as of december 31 2016 our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market funds invested in us treasury and us agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities did not exceed 700 million to further reduce credit risk we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriatea substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers we also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries we believe that the net accounts receivable balances from our three largest customers 31 in 2016 do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts balance sheet analysis and past collection experience for more information about the customers that represent our accounts receivable balance see note 4 operating segments and geographic information in part ii item 8 of this form 10kwe have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurancebusiness combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions based on their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition we consider this a critical accounting estimate because it involves a number of assumptions estimates and judgments that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements the most subjective areas include determining the fair value of the followingintangible assets including valuation methodology estimations of future cash flows and discount rates as well as the estimated useful life of the intangible assetsdeferred tax assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment preexisting liabilities or legal claims deferred revenue and contingent consideration each as may be applicable andgoodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumedour assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies we allocate goodwill to the reporting units of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination63table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedgoodwillapplication of the goodwill impairment test is considered a critical accounting estimate including the identification of reporting units assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units assignment of goodwill to reporting units and determination of fair value for each reporting unit we perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment of a reporting units goodwill the reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit additionally as part of this assessment we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting units fair value for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwillour goodwill impairment test considers both the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following major assumptions and inputs revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources the same estimates are also used in our business planning and forecasting process we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples and transaction prices of comparable companies although there were no specific qualitative indicators of impairment for our reporting units we elected to perform a step 1 impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2016 these reporting units were all deemed to have fair values that substantially exceeded their carrying value upon any reorganization of our operating segments we reevaluate our reporting units and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value approachidentified intangible assetswe amortize all acquisitionrelated intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit acquisitionrelated inprocess rampd assets represent the fair value of incomplete rampd projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition initially these are classified as inprocess research and development that are not subject to amortization once these rampd projects are completed the asset balances are transferred from inprocess research and development to acquisitionrelated developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balances relating to projects that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to rampdwe perform a quarterly review of significant finitelived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable we consider the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets a critical accounting estimate they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines our annual impairment assessment occurs in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if necessary a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets64table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedadvertisingcooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products we accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized we record cooperative advertising costs as marketing general and administrative mgampa expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable we record any excess in cash paid to customers over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive as a reduction in revenue advertising costs including direct marketing costs recorded within mgampa expenses were 18 billion in 2016 18 billion in 2015 and 18 billion in 2014employee equity incentive planswe use the straightline attribution method to recognize sharebased compensation over the service period of the award upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock options or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units rsus we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and rsus with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a firstin firstout basis as if each vesting period were a separate awardincome taxeswe compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes which includes the following critical accounting estimates we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxeswe use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether based on the technical merits of the position the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on examination the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provisionwe have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes loss contingencieswe are subject to loss contingencies including various legal and regulatory proceedings asserted and potential claims liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable as a

taxes  balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this amended standard requires that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent this amended standard was early adopted in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basisas a result of the adoption we made the following adjustments to the consolidated 2015 balance sheet a 20 billion decrease to current deferred tax assets a 430 million increase to noncurrent deferred tax assets a 21 million decrease to current deferred tax liabilities and a decrease of 16 billion to noncurrent deferred tax liabilitiesaccounting standards not yet adoptedstandarddescriptioneffective date and adoption considerationseffect on financial statements or other significant mattersrevenue recognition  contracts with customers this standard was issued to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the us resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under us gaap under the new model recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customerseffective in the first quarter of 2018 we plan to adopt the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective approachour assessment has identified a change in revenue recognition timing on our component sales made to distributors we expect to recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sells the components on the date of initial application we will remove the deferred net revenue on component sales made to distributors through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings we expect the revenue deferral historically recognized in the following period to be offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition as control of the product transfers to our customerour assessment has also identified a change in expense recognition timing related to payments we make to our customers for distinct services they perform as part of cooperative advertising programs we expect to recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activities occur we currently recognize the expense in the period the customer is entitled to participate in the program which coincides with the period of saleon the date of initial adoption we will capitalize the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings we expect the recognition of capitalized advertising to offset the deceleration in expense recognition until the marketing services are performedwe will continue our assessment operate parallel systems and processes as well as finalize our evaluation of any changes

controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
