new microarchitecture our 6th generation intel core processor family using our 14nm process technology we also plan to introduce a third 14nm product codenamed kaby lake this product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation intel core processor family we are also developing 10nm manufacturing process technology our nextgeneration process technologywe have continued expanding on the advances anticipated by moores law by bringing new capabilities into silicon and producing new products optimized for a wider variety of applications we expect these advances will result in a significant reduction in transistor leakage lower active power and an increase in transistor density to enable more smaller form factors such as powerful featurerich phones and tablets with a longer battery life for instance we have accelerated the intel atom processorbased soc roadmap for our mobile form factors including tablets and phones notebooks including ultrabook devices and 2 in 1 systems the internet of things and data center applications on our 32nm 22nm and 14nm process technologies in addition we offer the intel quark soc an ultralowpower and lowcost architecture designed for the internet of things such as industrial machines and wearable deviceswith our continued focus on silicon and manufacturing technology leadership we entered into a series of agreements with asml holding nv asml in 2012 certain of which were amended in 2014 to further define the commercial terms between the parties these amended agreements in which intel agreed to provide rampd funding over five years are intended to accelerate the development of extreme ultraviolet euv lithography projects and deep ultraviolet immersion lithography projects including generic developments applicable to both 300mm and 450mm14table of contentsour rampd activities range from designing and developing new products and manufacturing processes to researching future technologies and products we continue to make significant rampd investments in the development of soc devices to enable growth in mobile form factors in addition we continue to make significant investments in communications and connectivity for tablets phones and other connected devices including multimode lte modems our investment in cloudera inc cloudera completed in 2014 is evidence of our drive to bring big data analytics to the mainstream market through the joining of clouderas software platform and our data center architecture based on intel xeon processors we also continue to invest in leadingedge foundry platforms and ecosystem partner development graphics highperformance computing and communication and connectivityour rampd model is based on a global organization that emphasizes a collaborative approach to identifying and developing new technologies leading standards initiatives and influencing regulatory policies to accelerate the adoption of new technologies including joint pathfinding conducted between researchers at intel labs and our business groups we centrally manage key crossbusiness group product initiatives to align and prioritize our rampd activities across these groups in addition we may augment our rampd activities by investing in companies or entering into agreements with companies that have similar rampd focus areas as well as directly purchasing or licensing technology applicable to our rampd initiatives to drive innovation and gain efficiencies we intend to utilize our investments in intellectual property and rampd across our market segmentsemployeesas of december 26 2015 we had 107300 employees worldwide with approximately 51 of those employees located in the ussales and marketingcustomerswe sell our products primarily to oems

products are frequently made via purchase order acknowledgments that contain standard terms and conditions covering matters such as pricing payment terms and warranties as well as indemnities for issues specific to our products such as patent and copyright indemnities from time to time we may enter into additional agreements with customers covering for example changes from our standard terms and conditions new product development and marketing privatelabel branding and other matters our sales are routinely made using electronic and webbased processes that allow the customer to review inventory availability and track the progress of specific goods ordered pricing on particular products may vary based on volumes ordered and other factors we also offer discounts rebates and other incentives to customers to increase acceptance of our products and technology15table of contentsour products are generally shipped under terms that transfer title to the customer even in arrangements for which the recognition of revenue and related cost of sales is deferred our standard terms and conditions of sale typically provide that payment is due at a later date usually 30 days after shipment or delivery we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance credit losses may still be incurred due to bankruptcy fraud or other failure of the customer to pay for information about our allowance for doubtful receivables see schedule iivaluation and qualifying accounts in part iv of this form 10kour sales to distributors are typically made under agreements allowing for price protection on unsold merchandise and a right of return on stipulated quantities of unsold merchandise under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer our products typically have no contractual limit on the amount of price protection nor is there a limit on the time horizon under which price protection is granted the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor we have the option to grant credit for repair or replace defective products and there is no contractual limit on the amount of credit that may be granted to a distributor for defective productsdistributiondistributors typically handle a wide variety of products including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers customers may place orders directly with us or through distributors we have several distribution warehouses that are located in proximity to key customersbacklogover time our larger customers have generally moved to leaninventory or justintime operations rather than maintaining larger inventories of our products as our customers continue to lower their inventories our processes to fulfill their orders have evolved to meet their needs as a result our manufacturing production is based on estimates and advance nonbinding commitments from customers as to future purchases our order backlog as of any particular date is a mix of these commitments and specific firm orders that are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders for delivery of products only a small portion of our orders are noncancelable and the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significantseasonal trendshistorically our net revenue has typically been higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year accelerating in the third quarter and peaking in the fourth quartermarketingour global marketing objectives are to build a strong wellknown intel corporate brand that connects with businesses and consumers and to offer a limited number of meaningful and valuable brands in our portfolio to aid businesses and consumers in making informed choices about technology purchases the intel core processor family and the intel quark intel atom intel celeron intel pentium intel xeon intel xeon phi and intel itanium trademarks make up our processor brandswe promote brand awareness and preference and generate demand through our own direct marketing as well as through comarketing programs our direct marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as consumer and trade events industry and consumer communications and press relations we market to consumer and business audiences and focus on building awareness and generating demand for new form factors such as tablets allinone devices and 2 in 1 systems powered by intel our key messaging focuses on increased performance improved energy efficiency and other capabilities such as connectivity communications and security16table of contentspurchases by customers often allow them to participate in cooperative advertising and marketing programs such as the intel inside program this program broadens the reach of our brands beyond the scope of our own direct marketing through the intel inside program certain customers are licensed to place intel logos on computing devices containing our microprocessors and processor technologies and to use our brands in their marketing activities the program includes a market development component that accrues funds based on purchases and partially reimburses customers for marketing activities for products featuring intel brands subject to customers meeting defined criteria these marketing activities primarily include advertising through digital and social media and television as well as press relations we have also entered into joint marketing arrangements with

nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many us states and countries in latin america and asia also have or are developing similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not components such as microprocessors the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws changes in our product offerings and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts17table of contentswe are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including conflict minerals from the drc and adjoining countries in 2013 we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are drc conflictfree for tantalum tin tungsten and gold we continue our work to establish drc conflictfree supply chains for our company and our industry and are moving beyond microprocessors to validate our broader product base as drc conflictfree in 2016 for these four mineralswe seek to reduce our global greenhouse gas emissions by investing in energy conservation projects in our factories and

operations and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations due to risks and uncertainties known and unknown our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods you should also refer to the other information set forth in this annual report on form 10k including managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and our financial statements and the related noteschanges in product demand can harm our results of operation and financial conditiondemand for our products is variable and hard to predict changes in the demand for our products may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down the value of our assets important factors that could lead to variation in the demand for our products include changes inbusiness conditions including downturns in the computing industry or in the global or regional economiesconsumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions including changes in government borrowing taxation or spending policies the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity pricesthe level of our customers inventoriescompetitive and pricing pressures including actions taken by competitorscustomer product needsmarket acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing products andthe technology supply chain including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other eventswe face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we do not anticipate and respond to these developments our competitive position may weaken and our products or technologies might be uncompetitive or obsolete in recent years our business focus has expanded and now includes the design and production of platforms for tablets phones and other devices across the compute continuum including products for the internet of things and related services as a result we face new sources of competition including in certain of these market segments from incumbent competitors with established customer bases and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships with customers and partners in these market segments in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our products as well as expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions despite our ongoing efforts there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segmentsto compete successfully we must maintain a successful rampd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facilities including the construction of new fabrication facilities to support smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers our rampd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be wellreceived by customers our rampd investments may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating results for several years and such contributions may not meet our expectations or even cover the costs of such investments additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our productsif we are not able to compete effectively our financial results will be adversely affected including increased costs and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the writedown of the value of certain assets 20table of contentschanges in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results prices differ widely among the platforms we offer in our various market segments due to differences in features offered or manufacturing costs for example product offerings range from lowerpriced and entrylevel platforms such as those based on intel quark or intel atom processors to higherend platforms based on intel xeon and intel itanium processors if demand shifts from our higherpriced to lowerpriced platforms in any of our market segments our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when products are introduced they tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross marginwe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictionsglobal or regional conditions may harm our financial results we have manufacturing assembly and test rampd sales and other operations in many countries and some of our business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas moreover sales outside the us accounted for approximately 80 of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december 26 2015 as a result our operations and our financial results including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control includingglobal and local economic conditionsgeopolitical and security issues such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest crime political instability and terrorist activitynatural disasters public health issues and other catastrophic eventsinefficient infrastructure and other disruptions such as supply chain interruptions and largescale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities transportation data hosting or telecommunications providersgovernment restrictions on or nationalization of our operations in any country or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular countrydiffering employment practices and labor issues formal or informal imposition of new or revised export andor import and doingbusiness regulations which could be changed without noticeineffective legal protection of our ip rights in certain countries andlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide which may differ among jurisdictions affecting our operations in areas including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirements anticorruption foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions data privacy requirements anticompetition advertising employment environment health and safety compliance with such requirements may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operations negatively although we have policies controls and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with applicable laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors suppliers andor agents will not violate such laws or our policies violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputationwe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates we are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses may be paid in local currencies an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the us where we sell in dollars and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses as well as overseas capital expenditures we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition21table of contentscatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results our operations or systems could be disrupted by natural disasters geopolitical conditions terrorist activity public health issues cybersecurity incidents interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers or other catastrophic events such events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers receive production materials from our suppliers or perform critical functions which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disruptions we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention some of our policies have large deductibles and broad exclusions in addition one or more of our insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to pay a claim losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial conditionwe operate our own fabrication facilities and as a result are vulnerable to manufacturingrelated risks due to the variability in demand for our products we may be unable to timely respond to reduce costs when demand declines or to increase production when demand increases our operations have high costs that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our costs related to manufacturing such as facility construction and equipment rampd and the employment and training of a highly skilled workforce if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciationconversely if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introductions and related expenses including marketing expenseswe are subject to risks associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production of integrated circuits is a complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the nextgeneration process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carries inherent risks including difficulties in designing and developing nextgeneration process technologies development and production timing delays lower than anticipated manufacturing yields and product defects and errata disruptions in the production process can also result from errors defects in materials delays in obtaining or revising operating permits and licenses interruption in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields production issues can lead to increased costs and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the results from operationswe face supply chain risks thousands of suppliers provide materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however for certain materials we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location in addition consolidation among suppliers could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the products and services available to us the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs which could harm our business and results of operations22table of contentswe also rely on thirdparty providers to manufacture and assemble and test certain components or products particularly those related to networking mobile and communications and nand flash memory if any of these third parties are unable to perform these services on a timely basis we may encounter supply delays or disruptions that could adversely affect our financial resultsin addition there are regulatory and other requirements restrictions and requests from various constituencies regarding sourcing practices and supplier conduct with a trend toward expanding the scope of materials and locations where materials originate regulating supplier behaviors and increasing the required disclosures regarding such matters by public companies increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance costs to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many materials in the manufacturing of our products and rely on many suppliers to provide these materials but do not directly control their procurement or employment practiceswe are subject to the risks of product defects and errata product defects and errata deviations from published specifications may result from problems in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test processes components and products we purchase or license from thirdparty suppliers may also contain defects costs from defects and errata could includewriting off some or all of the value of inventoryrecalling products that have been shippedproviding product replacements or modifications anddefending against resulting litigationthese costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defects errata or other issues that we do not detect or fix could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product releases or result in legal liability the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of our components or for other reasons any of these occurrences could harm our business and financial resultswe are subject to risks associated with environmental laws and regulations the manufacturing and assembly and test of our products require the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of ehs laws and regulations our failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result inregulatory penalties fines and legal liabilitiessuspension of productionalteration of our fabrication and assembly and test processesreputational challenges andrestrictions on our operations or salesour failure to manage the use transportation emissions discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or future liabilities our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations such as air quality and wastewater requirements environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product designs or incur other expenses many new materials that we are evaluating for use in our operations may be subject to regulation under environmental laws and regulations these restrictions could harm our business and results of operations by increasing our expenses or requiring us to alter manufacturing and assembly and test processesclimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations if for example utility companies pass on their costs to their customers furthermore many of our operations are located in semiarid regions that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change our fabrication facilities require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse a portion of the water used we may have difficulties obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational needs due the lack of available infrastructure 23table of contentswe are subject to ip risks and risks associated with litigation and regulatory proceedingswe may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights we regard our patents copyrights trade secrets and other ip rights as important to the success of our business we rely on ip law as well as confidentiality and licensing agreements with our customers employees

may result in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under any of these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business in addition the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products as a result the value of our investment in rampd product development and marketing could be reducedour licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights companies in our industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may exhaust our patent rights as to licensed product sales under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impairedthird parties may assert claims based on ip rights against us or our products which could harm our business we may face claims based on ip rights from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are normally engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others whether or not meritorious could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel in addition we may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of thirdparty trade secrets and other confidential business information or enduser data that we obtain in conducting our business any such incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm furthermore we have agreed to indemnify customers for certain ip rights claims against them as a result of ip rights

condition and results of operations continuedwe achieved record net revenue for q4 2015 of 149 billion up 1 from q4 2014 we continue to see our business evolve as we execute on our strategy to leverage the virtuous cycle of growth with higher dcg platform nsg and iotg platform revenue these operating segments made up nearly 40 of our revenue and more than 60 of our operating profit for full year 2015 dcg and iotg both posted record net revenue for the quarter and was partially offset by lower ccg platform revenue we continue to believe that the worldwide pc supply chain is healthy with appropriate levels of inventorygross margin of 64 decreased by approximately one percentage point from q4 2014 primarily due to higher platform unit costs that resulted in part from a higher mix of 14nm platforms and lower platform unit sales these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices and to a lesser extent lower factory startup costs gross margin increased approximately two percentage points compared to the midpoint of the business outlook in october 2015 primarily driven by lower platform unit costs lower factory startup costs and higher platform average selling pricesfor full year 2015 our net revenue of 554 billion was down 1 from 2014 operating income of 140 billion was down 9 from 2014 and diluted earnings per share of 233 were up 1 from 2014 ccg net revenue was down 8 as we continued to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment and in particular the pc market as we were coming off of a strong growth rate in the second half of 2014 with the microsoft windows xp refresh we continue to see growth in dcg with net revenue up 11 and platform unit sales and average selling prices up 8 and 3 respectivelygross margin of 63 was down approximately one point from 2014 driven by higher platform unit costs on 14nm and lower platform unit sales these decreases were partially offset by higher platform average selling prices primarily driven by a higher mix of dcg platforms and higher average selling prices on a richer mix of platforms within the desktop and dcg platforms to a lesser extent the decrease in gross margin was also partially offset by lower factory startup costs on 14nm as well as lower production costs on 14nm which were treated as a period charge in 2014 operating profit was 140 billion in 2015 a decrease of 13 billion from 2014 driven by lower gross margin and increased investments in our growth market segments of the data center internet of things and memory our operating profit decrease was partially offset by lower investment in the pc market segment our effective tax rate for 2015 of 196 decreased 63 points from 2014 driven by onetime items and our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain prior years nonus earningsthe cash generation from our business remained strong with cash from operations of 190 billion in 2015 during 2015 we purchased 73 billion of capital assets down 28 billion from 2014 this change was primarily driven by our new strategy on nextgeneration process technology and manufacturing efficiencies namely that we extended the length of time we plan to use the 14nm process technology by introducing a third 14nm product codenamed kaby lake this product will have key performance enhancements as compared to our 6th generation intel core processor family we also returned

estimatesthe methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates includethe valuation of nonmarketable equity investments and the determination of otherthantemporary impairments which impact gains losses on equity investments net when we record impairmentsthe determination of useful lives for our property plant and equipment and the related timing of when depreciation should beginthe valuation and allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with business combinationsthe valuation and recoverability of longlived assets property plant and equipment identified intangibles and goodwill which impact gross

measurement of uncertain tax positions which impact our provision for taxesthe valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin andthe recognition and measurement of loss contingencies which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency revise the estimate for a loss contingency or record an asset impairmentin the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involvednonmarketable equity investmentswe regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 45 billion as of december 26 2015 32 billion as of december 27 2014our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheetsnonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k34table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuedwe determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for impairment and disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment is recognized the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes a qualitative and quantitative analysis of events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment qualitative analysis of our investments involves understanding each investees revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects the technological feasibility of our investees products and technologies the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory or economic changes and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as revenue earnings comparable performance multiples recent financing rounds the terms of investees issued interests and the level of marketability of the investments the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding the investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we record the investment at fair value by recognizing an impairment impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 166 million in 2015 140 million in 2014 and 112 million in 2013property plant and equipment depreciationmanagement judgment is required in determining the estimated economic useful lives of our property plant and equipment which can materially impact our depreciation expense accordingly at least annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these assets during the assessment performed in q4 2015 we considered factors such as the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transitions on both 14nm and 10nm products with those longer transitions we added a third product to our 14nm roadmap we have also increased reuse of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology as a result we determined that the useful lives of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facilities should be increased from four to five years we will account for this as a change in estimate that will be applied prospectively effective in q1 2016 this change in depreciable life drives approximately 15 billion in lower depreciation expense for 2016 approximately half of this benefit will increase gross margin impacting both unit cost and startup costs approximately onefourth will decrease rampd expenses and the remaining onefourth will result in lower inventory costs and ending inventory valuesas part of our longrange capacity planning construction on certain facilities is on hold and the facilities are not in use these facilities are being held in a safe state and we have plans to place them into service at a future date the time at which these assets are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for specific products and where we are in the transition of products on our roadmap management is required to make judgments as to the timing of when these facilities will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our products which is when depreciation begins 35table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuedbusiness combinationsaccounting for acquisitions requires our management to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired which involves a number of judgments assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the timing or amounts recognized in our financial statements the items involving the most significant assumptions estimates and judgments include determining the fair value of the followingintangible assets including valuation methodology estimations of future cash flows and discount rates as well as the estimated useful life of the intangible assetsthe acquired companys brand as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be useddeferred tax assets and liabilities uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances which are initially estimated as of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment preexisting liabilities or legal claims deferred revenue and contingent consideration each as may be applicable andgoodwill as measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumedwe allocate goodwill and intangible assets to the reporting units based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combination upon any reorganization of our operating segments we reevaluate our reporting units and if necessary reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach our assumptions and estimates are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired companies while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year following the acquisition date we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill longlived asset impairmentsproperty plant and equipmentwe assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognizedimpairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new shorter useful lives based on our analysis impairments and accelerated depreciation of our property plant and equipment totaled 151 million in 2015 115 million in 2014 and 172 million in 201336table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuedidentified intangibleswe make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assetthe assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment assessment we recognized impairment charges of 7 million in 2015 36 million in 2014 and 17 million in 2013goodwillgoodwill is recorded when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component and are consistent with the operating segments identified in note 26 operating segments and geographic information in part ii item 8 of this form 10kwe perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit additionally as part of this assessment we may perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors above by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting units fair value for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional analysis if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if we determine during the second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the differencedetermining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate a reporting units fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following assumptions and inputs revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium a reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt37table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuedfor the annual impairment assessment in 2015 we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these yearsincome taxeswe must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent periodwe must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not more likely than not we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery is not more likely than not recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxeswe use a twostep process to recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual outcomes determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provisionwe have not recognized us deferred income taxes on certain undistributed nonus earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the us remittances of nonus earnings are based on estimates and judgments of projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and investment requirements of our nonus and us operations material changes in our estimates of cash working capital and investment needs in various jurisdictions could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested nonus earnings which would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxesinventoryintel has a product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestones these engineering milestones are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activities and associated costs change in nature from rampd to cost of sales in order for a product to be manufactured in high volumes and sold to our customers under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specifications this milestone is known as product release qualification prq we have identified prq as the point at which the costs incurred to manufacture our products are included in the valuation of inventory to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges excess capacity charges were insignificant in 2015 insignificant in 2014 and 319 million in 201338table of contentsmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continuedinventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence customer acceptance of our products and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost if the estimated market value of the inventory is less than the carrying value we write down the inventory and record the difference as a charge to cost of sales inventory reserves increased by approximately 185 million in 2015 compared to 2014 the valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross marginloss contingencieswe are subject to loss contingencies including various legal and regulatory proceedings and asserted and potential claims accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects as well as product warranties and potential asset impairments that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may

in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the chinese yuan the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in the fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs these programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements for further information see risk factors in part i item 1a of

an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 75 million as of december 26 2015 less than 50 million as of december 27 2014interest rateswe generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate

preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the us dollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10 after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 15 million as of december 26 2015 an increase of approximately 10 million as of december 27 2014 after taking into account interest rate and currency swaps a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of up to 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 16 billion as of december 26 2015 an increase of approximately 10 billion as of december 27 2014 the increase from december 27 2014 was primarily driven by the inclusion of 95 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in q3 and q4 2015 the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further

market risk management program may include equity derivatives with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives we also utilize total return

unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the historical market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a decline of 30 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 18 billion based on the value as of december 26 2015 a decrease in value of approximately 21 billion based on the value as of december 27 2014 using an assumed decline of 30many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable cost method equity investments had a carrying

accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes the accounting estimates that require our most significant difficult and subjective judgments includethe valuation of nonmarketable equity investments and the determination of otherthantemporary impairmentsthe determination

from our estimatesfair valuefair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value except for cost method investments cost method loans receivable equity method investments grants receivable and reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months substantially all of our liabilities are not measured and recorded at fair valuefair value hierarchythe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as followslevel 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilitieslevel 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in less active markets or modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level 2 inputs also include nonbinding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for securityspecific restrictions66table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements

section that follows we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level our availableforsale investments includemarketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met we generally hold these debt

netmarketable equity securities when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification we acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic

considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis impairments affect earnings as followsmarketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument that is a credit loss exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument we separate otherthantemporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses which are recognized in interest and other net and amounts related to all other factors which are recognized in other comprehensive income lossmarketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment which include the consideration of general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and the business outlook for the investee which may include industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and changes in the investees credit rating we record otherthantemporary impairments on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains losses on equity investments

nonmarketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains losses on equity investments netderivative financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk when possible we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple separate derivative transactions generally our master netting agreements allow for net settlement in case of certain triggering events such as bankruptcy or default of one of the counterparties to the transaction we may also elect to exchange cash collateral with certain of our counterparties on a regular basis for presentation on our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets other longterm assets other accrued liabilities or other longterm liabilitiesour accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for hedge accounting designation 68table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continueda designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction or variability in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of a recognized asset or liability are examples of cash flow hedges the criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur for derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation we report the aftertax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item primarily within cash flows from operating activitiesa designated hedge with exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability that are attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate is one example of a fair value hedge for derivatives with fair value hedge accounting designation the gains and losses of the hedge as well as the offsetting gains and losses attributable to the changes in the benchmark interest rate on the underlying hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period derivatives that we designated as fair value hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item primarily within cash flows from financing activitieswe recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures primarily in interest and other net and gains losses on equity investments net as part of our strategic investment program we also acquire equity derivative instruments such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments which we do not designate as hedging instruments we recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains losses on equity investments net realized gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities or investing activities depending on the activity the exposure is most closely associated withmeasurement of effectivenesseffectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item for currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases forward points are excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item for currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged itemeffectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged itemeffectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged itemif a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is probable that the original hedged transaction will not occur as previously anticipated the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into earnings subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other net in each period until the instrument matures is terminated is redesignated as a qualified cash flow hedge or is sold ineffective portions of cash flow hedges as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings in interest and other net for further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs see note 6

institutions generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment and financing transactions selected securities may be loaned secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities the loaned

corresponding liability for lending agreements collateralized by other securities we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledgedloans receivablewe make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other longterm assets we may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument we record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate currency and counterparty credit changes largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments in interest and other net loans that are denominated in us dollars and have a floatingrate coupon

finitelived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets which is calculated based on projected discounted net cash flows if an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if necessary a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assetsfor further discussion of identified

product failures and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presentedrevenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete as evidenced by an agreement with the customer delivery has occurred and acceptance if applicable as well as fixed pricing and probable collectability we record pricing allowances including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer we include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of

advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized we record cooperative advertising costs as marketing general and administrative mgampa expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable we record any excess in cash paid

method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realizedwe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on the consolidated statements of income for more information about income taxes see note 23 income taxesnote 3 recent accounting standards in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a new standard to achieve a consistent application of revenue recognition within the us resulting in a single revenue model to be applied by reporting companies under us generally accepted accounting principles under the new model recognition of revenue occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers on july 9 2015 the fasb agreed to delay the effective date by one year accordingly the new standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 and we expect to adopt it at that time the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements in 2015 the fasb issued an amended standard requiring that we classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent the amended standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017 early adoption is permitted and we are evaluating whether we will early adopt the amended standard may be adopted on either a prospective or retrospective basis we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations in 2015 the fasb issued an amended standard requiring that we recognize the effect on earnings of any adjustments identified during the measurement period after an acquisition in the same period the adjustment is identified as opposed to the prior standard which required material adjustments be retrospectively adjusted the amended standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2016 we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statementsin january 2016 the fasb issued changes to the accounting for financial instruments that primarily affect equity investments financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments this standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2018 certain provisions allow for early adoption and we are evaluating whether we will elect to early adopt these provisions the new standard should be applied by means of a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption with certain exceptions we have not yet determined the impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statementsin 2015 we adopted an amended standard simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the debt liability rather than showing the debt issuance costs as an asset we have applied the amendment retrospectively to the comparable period presented and it did not have a significant impact on our financial statements73table of contentsintel corporationnotes to

include investments such as assetbacked securities corporate debt financial institution instruments government debt and reverse repurchase agreements classified as cash equivalents we classify our debt instruments as level 2 when we use observable market prices for identical instruments that are traded in less active markets when observable market prices for identical instruments are not available we price the debt instruments using our own models such as a discounted cash flow model or nonbinding market consensus prices based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs including nonbinding and binding broker quotes observable market prices for identical or similar instruments and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and unobservable market inputs that we consider to be not significant when we use nonbinding market consensus prices we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs such as liborbased yield curves currency spot and forward rates and credit ratings all significant inputs are derived from or corroborated with observable market datathe fair values of debt instruments classified as level 3 are generally derived from discounted cash flow models performed either by us or our pricing providers using inputs that we are unable to corroborate with observable market data we monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes fair value option for loans receivablewe elected the fair value option for loans receivable when the interest rate or currency exchange rate risk was hedged at

regulatory or economic changes and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessments of the fair value of our investments are developed using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as revenue earnings comparable performance multiples recent financing rounds the terms of the investees issued interests and the level of marketability of the investments the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors including comparable companies sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates regarding investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data we measure

concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments derivative financial instruments loans receivable reverse repurchase agreements and trade receivables when possible we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple separate derivative transactions for presentation on our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangementswe generally place investments with highcreditquality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better rated issuances and a substantial majority of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least a2p2 by standard amp poorsmoodys and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities for instance investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of aaaa3 at the time of investment government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our nonus subsidiaries or the absence of arated counterparties in certain countries result in some minor exceptions creditrating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments due to master netting arrangements the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty as of december 26 2015 our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market funds invested in us treasury and us agency securities and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by treasury and agency securities did not exceed 500 million to further reduce credit risk we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriatea substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers we also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and communications equipment manufacturers in the computing and communications industries hewlettpackard company our largest customer in 2014 separated into hp inc and hewlett packard enterprise company on november 1 2015 these

accounts receivable as of december 26 2015 43 as of december 27 2014 we believe that the net accounts receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts balance sheet analysis and past collection experiencewe have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance 87table of

we developed the discount rate by calculating the benefit payment streams by year to determine when benefit payments will be due we then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the aa corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate for the nonus plans we used two approaches to develop the discount rate in certain countries we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans in other countries we analyzed current market longterm bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the investment portfolios and is developed through consensus and buildingblock methodologies the consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography the buildingblock approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes in addition we analyze rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan expectations of future returns local actuarial projections and the projected longterm rates of return from external investment managers the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets shown for the nonus plan assets is weighted to reflect each countrys relative portion of the nonus plan assetsnet periodic benefit costin 2015 the net periodic benefit cost for us pension benefits nonus pension benefits and

the ultimate outcome of these proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not materially harm our financial position results of operations cash flows or overall trends legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages in addition in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies an unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends we might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders employees and customers and any such settlement could include substantial payments except as specifically described below we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time115table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedgovernment competition matters and related consumer class actionsa number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices the allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs in general they contend that we improperly conditioned price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or nearexclusive dealing by some of our customers and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly preferred intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that through the use of our compilers and other means we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading benchmark results concerning our microprocessors based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters which we describe in the following paragraphs our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 20052011 nonetheless certain of the matters remain active and these challenges could continue for a number of years potentially requiring us to invest additional resources we believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing business intellectual property and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedingsin 2001 the european commission ec commenced an investigation regarding claims by advanced micro devices inc amd that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors we received numerous requests for information and documents from the ec and we responded to each of those requests the ec issued a statement of objections in july 2007 and held a hearing on that statement in march 2008 the ec issued a supplemental statement of objections in july 2008 in may 2009 the ec issued a decision finding that we had violated article 82 of the ec treaty and article 54 of the european economic area agreement in general the ec found that we violated article 82 later renumbered as article 102 by a new treaty by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us the ec also found that we violated article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products the ec imposed a fine in the amount of 11 billion 14 billion as of may 2009 which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009 and ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the ec decision the ec decision contained no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices instead the decision stated that we should cease and desist from further conduct that in the ecs opinion would violate applicable law we took steps which are subject to the ecs ongoing review to comply with that decision pending appeal we had discussions with the ec to better understand the decision and to explain changes to our business practices we appealed the ec decision to the court of first instance which has been renamed the general court in july 2009 the hearing of our appeal took place in july 2012 in june 2014 the general court rejected our appeal in its entirety in august 2014 we filed an appeal with the european court of justice on november 11 2014 intervener association for competitive technologies filed comments in support of intels grounds of appeal the ec and interveners filed briefs in november 2014 we filed a reply in february 2015 and the ec filed a rejoinder in april 2015 the court of justice is likely to hold oral argument and issue its decision in 2016at least 82 separate classaction lawsuits have been filed in the us district courts for the northern district of california southern district of california district of idaho district of nebraska district of new mexico district of maine and district of delaware as well as in various california kansas and tennessee state courts these actions generally repeat the allegations made in a nowsettled lawsuit filed against us by amd in june 2005 in the us district court for the district of delaware amd litigation like the amd litigation these classaction lawsuits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the sherman act and other laws by among other things providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or nearexclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with amds ability to sell its microprocessors interfering with certain amd product launches and interfering with amds participation in certain industry standardssetting groups the class actions allege various consumer injuries including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors we dispute these classaction claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously116table of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedall of the federal and state class actions other than the california class actions were transferred by the multidistrict litigation panel to the us district court in delaware for all pretrial proceedings and discovery mdl proceedings the delaware district court appointed a special master to address issues in the mdl proceedings as assigned by the court in january 2010 the plaintiffs in the delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence this motion largely copies a motion previously filed by amd in the amd litigation which has settled the plaintiffs in the mdl proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain personal computers containing products sold by us in july 2010 the special master issued a report and recommendation report denying the motion to certify a class the mdl plaintiffs filed objections to the special masters report and a hearing on those objections was held before the district court in july 2013 in july 2014 the district court affirmed the special masters ruling and issued an order denying the mdl plaintiffs motion for class certification in august 2014 plaintiffs filed a petition for interlocutory appeal of the district courts decision with the us court of appeals for the third circuit which the third circuit denied in

dismissed in september 2015all california class actions have been consolidated in the superior court of california in santa clara county the plaintiffs in the california actions moved for class certification which we are in the process of opposing at our request the court in the california actions agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the delaware district court ruled on the similar motion in the mdl proceedings the plaintiffs asked the court for leave to retain a new expert and to amend their previous motion for class certification the court granted plaintiffs request in february 2015 and the hearing on plaintiffs amended class certification motion took place in january 2016 we are awaiting the courts decision given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases
