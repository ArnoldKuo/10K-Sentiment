eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions we use the equity method to account for equity investments in instances in which we own common stock or similar interests and have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee in the first quarter of 2011 we completed the acquisition of mcafee inc for further information see note 13 acquisitions certain of the operations acquired from mcafee have a functional currency other than the us dollar as a result we have recorded translation adjustments through accumulated other comprehensive income loss beginning in 2011 prior to the acquisition of mcafee the us dollar was the functional currency for our company and all of our subsidiaries therefore we did not record a translation adjustment through accumulated other comprehensive income loss for fiscal year 2010  note 2 accounting policies  use of estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes the accounting estimates that require our most significant difficult and subjective judgments include        the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments and the determination of otherthantemporary impairments        the assessment of recoverability of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and identified intangibles        the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions        the valuation of inventory and        the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies  the actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates  fair value  fair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial assets and liabilities are measured and recorded at fair value except for equity method investments cost method investments cost method loans receivable reverse repurchase agreements with original maturities greater than approximately three months and most of our liabilities  fair value hierarchy  the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows  level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level 2 observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in less active markets or modelderived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level 2 inputs also include nonbinding market consensus prices that can be corroborated with observable market data as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for securityspecific restrictions  level 3 unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities level 3 inputs also include nonbinding market consensus prices or nonbinding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data  for further discussion of fair value see note

are generally designated as trading assets when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt instrument is used to economically hedge foreign exchange rate risk from the remeasurement of intercompany loans investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value the gains or losses of these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and intercompany loans are recorded in interest and other net we also designate certain floatingrate securitized financial instruments primarily assetbacked securities as trading assets  availableforsale investments  we consider all liquid availableforsale debt instruments with original maturities from the date of purchase of approximately three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents availableforsale debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than approximately three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as shortterm investments availableforsale debt instruments with remaining maturities beyond one year are classified as other longterm investments  investments that we designate as availableforsale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss except as noted in the otherthantemporary impairment section that follows we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level our availableforsale investments include        marketable debt instruments when the interest rate and foreign currency risks are not hedged at the inception of          the investment or when our criteria for designation as trading assets are not met we generally hold these debt instruments to generate a return commensurate with the usdollar threemonth libor we record the interest income and realized gains and losses on the sale of these instruments in interest and other net        marketable equity securities when there are barriers to mitigating equity market risk through the sale or use of derivative instruments at the time of original classification and when there is no plan to sell the investment at the time of original classification we acquire these equity investments to promote business and strategic objectives to the extent that these investments continue to have strategic value we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks through hedging activities we record the realized gains or losses on the sale or exchange of marketable equity securities in gains losses on equity investments net  nonmarketable and other equity investments  our nonmarketable equity and other equity investments are included in other longterm assets we account for nonmarketable equity and other equity investments for which we do not have control over the investee as        equity method investments when we have the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee equity method investments include marketable and nonmarketable investments our proportionate share of the income or loss is recognized on a onequarter lag and is recorded in gains losses on equity investments net        nonmarketable cost method investments when the equity method does not apply we record the realized gains or losses on the sale of nonmarketable cost method investments in gains losses on equity investments net     50    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued     otherthantemporary impairment  our availableforsale investments and nonmarketable and other equity investments are subject to a periodic impairment review investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investments adjusted cost basis impairments affect earnings as follows        marketable debt instruments when the fair value is below amortized cost and we intend to sell the instrument or when it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument that is a credit loss exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument we separate otherthantemporary impairments into amounts representing credit losses which are recognized in interest and other net and amounts related to all other factors which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss        marketable equity securities based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment which include the consideration of general market conditions the duration and extent to which the fair value is below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of value in the foreseeable future we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and the business outlook for the investee which may include industry and sector performance changes in technology operational and financing cash flow factors and changes in the investees credit rating we record otherthantemporary impairment charges on marketable equity securities and marketable equity method investments in gains losses on equity investments

charges for nonmarketable cost method investments and equity method investments in gains losses on equity investments net  derivative financial instruments  our primary objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk and commodity price risk our derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value and are included in other current assets other longterm assets other accrued liabilities or other longterm liabilities  our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments are based on whether they meet the criteria for designation as a cash flow hedge a designated hedge with exposure to variability in the functional currency equivalent of the future foreign currency cash flows of a forecasted transaction is referred to as a cash flow hedge the criteria for designating a derivative as a cash flow hedge include the assessment of the instruments effectiveness in risk reduction matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur for derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation we report the aftertax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction derivatives that we designate as cash flow hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same section as the underlying item primarily within cash flows from operating activities  we recognize gains and losses from changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures primarily in interest and other net and gains losses on equity investments net as part of our strategic investment program we also acquire equity derivative instruments such as equity conversion rights associated with debt instruments that we do not designate as hedging instruments we recognize the gains or losses from changes in fair value of these equity derivative instruments in gains losses on equity investments net gains and losses from derivatives not designated as hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within cash flows from operating activities     51    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued     measurement of effectiveness        effectiveness for forwards is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flows of the hedged item for currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to capital purchases forward points are excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item for currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging strategies related to operating expenditures forward points are included and effectiveness is measured using forward rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item        effectiveness for options is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the intrinsic value of an option instrument representing the hedged risks in the hedged item time value is excluded and effectiveness is measured using spot rates to value both the hedge contract and the hedged item        effectiveness for interest rate swaps and commodity swaps is generally measured by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the swap with the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item  if a cash flow hedge is discontinued because it is no longer probable that the original hedged transaction will occur as previously anticipated the cumulative unrealized gain or loss on the related derivative is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into earnings subsequent gains or losses on the related derivative instrument are recognized in interest and other net in each period until the instrument matures is terminated is redesignated as a qualified cash flow hedge or is sold ineffective portions of cash flow hedges as well as amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings in interest and other net for further discussion of our derivative instruments and risk management programs see note 7 derivative financial instruments  securities lending  we may enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions generally to facilitate hedging and certain investment transactions selected securities may be loaned secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities the loaned securities continue to be carried as investment assets on our consolidated balance sheets for lending agreements collateralized by cash and cash equivalents collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability for lending agreements collateralized by other securities we do not record the collateral as an asset or a liability unless the collateral is repledged  loans receivable  we make loans to third parties that are classified within other current assets or other longterm assets we may elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument we record the gains or losses on these loans arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate currency and counterparty credit changes largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments in interest and other net loans that are denominated in us dollars and have a floatingrate coupon are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loans receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loans rather than the stated coupon rate for further discussion of our loans receivable see note

following estimated useful lives machinery and equipment 2 to 4 years buildings 4 to 25 years  we capitalize a majority of interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the assets we record capitalrelated government grants earned as a reduction to property plant and equipment  goodwill  we record goodwill when the purchase price of an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets as of the date of acquisition assigning the goodwill to our applicable reporting units based on the relative expected fair value provided by the acquisition we perform a quarterly review of goodwill for indicators of impairment during the fourth quarter of each year we perform an impairment   assessment for each reporting unit and we perform impairment tests using a fair value approach when necessary the reporting units carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt for further discussion of goodwill see note 15 goodwill  identified intangible assets  licensed technology and patents are generally amortized on a straightline basis over the periods of benefit we amortize all acquisitionrelated intangible assets that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development assets represent the fair value of incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition initially these are classified as other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization assets related to projects that have been completed are transferred from other intangible assets to acquisitionrelated developed technology these are subject to amortization while assets related to projects that have been abandoned are impaired and expensed to research and development in the quarter following the period in which identified intangible assets become fully amortized we remove the fully amortized balances from the gross asset and accumulated amortization amounts  the estimated useful life ranges for identified intangible assets that are subject to

perform a quarterly review of finitelived identified intangible assets to determine whether facts and circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable if such facts and circumstances exist we assess recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets if an assets useful life is shorter than originally estimated we accelerate the rate of amortization and amortize the remaining carrying value over the new shorter useful life we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable if necessary a quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset with its carrying value impairments if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets  for further discussion of identified intangible assets see note 16 identified intangible assets  product warranty  the vast majority of our products are sold with a limited warranty on product quality and a limited indemnification for customers against intellectual property rights infringement claims related to our products the accrual and the related expense for known product warranty issues were not significant during the periods presented due to product testing the short time typically between product shipment and the detection and correction of product failures and the historical rate of payments on indemnification claims the accrual and related expense for estimated incurred but unidentified issues were not significant during the periods presented  revenue recognition  we recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete as evidenced by an agreement with the customer delivery has occurred and acceptance if applicable as well as fixed pricing and probable collectibility we record pricing allowances including discounts based on contractual arrangements with customers when we recognize revenue as a reduction to both accounts receivable and net revenue because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry we defer product revenue and related costs of sales from component   sales made to distributors under agreements allowing price protection or right of return until the distributors sell the merchandise the right of return granted generally consists of a stock rotation program in which distributors are able to exchange certain products based on the number of qualified purchases made by the distributor under the price protection program we give distributors credits for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer we include shipping charges billed to customers in net revenue and include the related shipping costs in cost of sales  revenue from license agreements with our mcafee business generally includes service and support agreements for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period revenue derived from online subscription products is deferred and recognized ratably

licenses maintenance andor services revenue is allocated across the separately identified deliverables and may be recognized or deferred when vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe does not exist for undelivered elements such as maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period direct costs such as costs related to revenuesharing and royalty arrangements associated with license arrangements as well as component costs associated with product revenue and sales commissions are deferred and amortized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized  we record deferred revenue offset by the related cost of sales on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred income  advertising  cooperative advertising programs reimburse customers for marketing activities for certain of our products subject to defined criteria we accrue cooperative advertising obligations and record the costs at the same time that the related revenue is recognized we record cooperative advertising costs as marketing general and administrative expenses to the extent that an advertising benefit separate from the revenue transaction can be identified and the fair value of that advertising benefit received is determinable we record any excess in cash paid over the fair value of the advertising benefit received as a reduction in revenue advertising

incentive plans we use the straightline attribution method to recognize sharebased compensation over the service period of the award upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock options or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock units rsus we eliminate deferred tax assets for options and restricted stock units with multiple vesting dates for each vesting period on a firstin firstout basis as if each vesting period were a separate award  income tax  we compute the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it is believed more likely than not to be realized  we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if that tax position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position we then measure the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes for more information about income taxes see note 26 income taxes  note 3 accounting changes  2012  in the first quarter of 2012 we adopted amended standards that increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income these amended standards eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and they require that all changes in stockholders equityexcept investments by and distributions to ownersbe presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive   statements our adoption of these amended standards impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income as we have elected to present two separate but consecutive statements but it did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations  in the fourth quarter of 2012 we adopted amended standards to simplify how we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment these amended standards improve consistency in impairment testing requirements among longlived asset categories the amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value for assets in which this assessment concludes that the fair value is more likely than not to be more than its carrying value these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standards our adoption of these amended standards did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  2011  in the first quarter of 2011 we adopted new standards for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables these new standards change the determination of whether the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units for accounting purposes additionally these new standards modify the method by which revenue is allocated to the separately identified deliverables the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in the first quarter of 2011 we adopted new standards that remove certain tangible products and associated software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance the adoption of these new standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in the fourth quarter of 2011 we adopted amended standards that simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment these amended standards allow for an assessment of qualitative factors such that we can determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is more likely than not to be less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this

agreements classified as cash equivalents when we use observable market prices for identical securities that are traded in lessactive markets we classify our debt investments as level 2 when observable market prices for identical securities are not available we price our debt investments using nonbinding market consensus prices that are corroborated with observable market data quoted market prices for similar instruments or pricing models such as a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data nonbinding market consensus prices are based on the proprietary valuation models of pricing providers or brokers these valuation models incorporate a number of inputs including nonbinding and binding broker quotes observable market prices for identical or similar securities and the internal assumptions of pricing providers or brokers that use observable market inputs and to a lesser degree unobservable market inputs we corroborate nonbinding market consensus prices with observable market data using statistical models when observable market data exists the discounted cash flow model uses observable market inputs such as liborbased yield curves currency spot and forward rates and credit ratings  debt investments that are classified as level 3 are classified as such due to the lack of observable market data to corroborate either the nonbinding market consensus prices or the nonbinding broker quotes when observable market data is not available we corroborate our fair value measurements using nonbinding market consensus prices and nonbinding broker quotes from a second source  fair value option for loans receivable  we elected the fair value option for loans made to third parties when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument   as of december 29 2012 the fair value of our loans receivable for which we elected the fair value option did not significantly differ from the contractual principal balance based on the contractual currency loans receivable are classified within other current assets and other longterm assets fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated with observable market data gains and losses from changes in fair value on the loans receivable and related derivative instruments as well as interest income are recorded in interest and other net during all periods presented changes in the fair value of our loans receivable were largely offset by changes in the related derivative instruments resulting in an insignificant net impact on our consolidated statements of income gains and losses attributable to changes in credit risk are determined using observable credit default spreads for the issuer or comparable companies these gains and losses were insignificant during all periods presented we did not elect the fair value option for loans when the interest rate or foreign exchange rate risk was not hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument  assets measured and recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  our nonmarketable equity investments nonmarketable equity method and cost method investments and nonfinancial assets such as intangible assets and property plant and equipment are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized  a portion of our nonmarketable equity investments has been measured and recorded at fair value due to events or circumstances that significantly impacted the fair value of those investments resulting in otherthantemporary impairment charges we classified these investments as level 3 as we used unobservable inputs to the valuation methodologies that were significant to the fair value measurements and the valuations required management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices impairment charges recognized on

nonmarketable cost method investments was insignificant  our nonmarketable cost method investments are valued using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors including comparable companies sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimates for investees revenue costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenues and costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data the valuation of these nonmarketable cost method investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees capital structure the terms of the

objective for holding derivative financial instruments is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to a lesser extent equity market risk and commodity price risk we currently do not hold derivative instruments for the purpose of managing credit risk as we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty and generally enter into derivative transactions with highcreditquality counterparties we also enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple separate derivative transactions for presentation on our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements  currency exchange rate risk  we are exposed to currency exchange rate risk and generally hedge our exposures with currency forward contracts currency interest rate swaps or currency options substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases are incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates our nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable are generally hedged with offsetting currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps we may also hedge foreign currency risk arising from funding foreign   currency denominated forecasted investments these programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange movements  our currency risk management programs include        currency derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts and currency options to hedge exposures to the variability in the usdollar equivalent of anticipated nonusdollardenominated cash flows these instruments generally mature within 12 months for these derivatives we report the aftertax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction        currency derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flows of recognized monetary assets and liabilities nonusdollardenominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of nonusdollardenominated loans receivable recognized at fair value the majority of these instruments mature within 12 months changes in the functional currency equivalent cash flows of the underlying assets and liabilities are approximately offset by the changes in fair value of the related derivatives we record net gains or losses in the line item on the consolidated statements of income most closely associated with the related exposures primarily in interest and other net except for equityrelated gains or losses which we primarily record in gains losses on equity investments net  interest rate risk  our primary objective for holding investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields we generally swap the returns on our investments in fixedrate debt instruments with remaining maturities longer than six months into usdollar threemonth liborbased returns unless management specifically approves otherwise these swaps are settled at various interest payment times involving cash payments at each interest and principal payment date with the majority of the contracts having quarterly payments

hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swap agreements to modify the interest characteristics of debt instruments for these derivatives we report the aftertax gain or loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and we reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction        interest rate derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize interest rate swaps and currency interest rate swaps in economic hedging transactions including hedges of nonusdollardenominated debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of nonusdollardenominated loans receivable recognized at fair value floating interest rates on the swaps are reset on a quarterly basis changes in fair value of the debt instruments classified as trading assets and hedges of loans receivable recognized at fair value are generally offset by changes in fair value of the related derivatives both of which are recorded in interest and other net  equity market risk  our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks in addition for our securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk our equity market risk management program includes equity derivatives without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrants equity options or other equity derivatives we recognize changes in the fair value of such derivatives in gains losses on equity investments net    we also utilize total return swaps to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements gains and losses from changes in fair value of these total return swaps are generally offset by the gains and losses on the related liabilities both of which are recorded in cost of sales and operating expenses the deferred compensation liabilities were 859 million as of december 29 2012 700 million as of december 31 2011 and are included in other accrued liabilities  in 2010 we sold our ownership interest in numonyx bv to micron technology inc for consideration consisting of shares of micron we also entered into equity option transactions that economically hedged a portion of the ownership interest in micron that we acquired in the second quarter of 2011 we sold our remaining ownership interest in micron and the related equity options matured  commodity price risk  we operate facilities that consume commodities and have established forecasted transaction risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in commodity prices such as those for natural gas these programs reduce but do not always eliminate the impact of commodity price movements  our commodity price risk management program includes commodity derivatives with cash flow hedge accounting designation that utilize commodity swap contracts to hedge future cash flow exposures to the variability in commodity prices these instruments generally mature within 12 months for these derivatives we report the aftertax gain loss from the effective portion of the hedge as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassify it into earnings in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statements of income as the impact of the hedged transaction     61    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued     volume of derivative activity  total gross

credit risk    financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments derivative financial instruments loans receivable and trade receivables when possible we enter into master netting arrangements with counterparties to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple separate derivative transactions for presentation on our consolidated balance sheets we do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements  we generally place investments with highcreditquality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterpartys relative credit standing substantially all of our investments in debt instruments are in aa2 or better   rated issuances and the majority of the issuances are rated aaaa3 or better our investment policy requires substantially all investments with original maturities at the time of investment of up to six months to be rated at least a2p2 by standard amp poorsmoodys and specifies a higher minimum rating for investments with longer maturities for instance investments with maturities of greater than three years generally require a minimum rating of aaaa3 at the time of investment government regulations imposed on investment alternatives of our nonus subsidiaries or the absence of a rated counterparties in certain countries result in some minor exceptions creditrating criteria for derivative instruments are similar to those for other investments due to master netting arrangements the amounts subject to credit risk related to derivative instruments are generally limited to the amounts if any by which the counterpartys obligations exceed our obligations with that counterparty as of     63    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued      december 29 2012 our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding us and japan government bonds did not exceed 750 million we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligations including securities lending transactions when we deem it appropriate  a substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers we also have accounts receivable derived from sales to industrial and retail distributors our three largest customers accounted for 43 of net revenue for 2012 43 of net revenue for 2011 and 46 of net revenue for 2010 additionally these three largest customers accounted for 33 of our accounts receivable as of december 29 2012 and 36 of our accounts receivable as   of december 31 2011 we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on cash flow forecasts balance sheet analysis and past collection experience  we have adopted credit policies and standards intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risks are moderated by the financial stability of our major customers we assess credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis and from this analysis we establish credit limits and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support devices such as obtaining a parent guarantee or standby letter of credit or obtaining credit insurance

venture relationship under the agreements and as of december 29 2012 we own a 49   interest in the remaining assets held by imft and no longer hold an ownership interest in imfs we received 605

statements of cash flows     64    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued     as part of the agreements to modify our joint venture relationship we also entered into an amended operating agreement for imft this amended operating agreement extends the term of imft to 2024 unless earlier terminated under certain terms and conditions and provides that imft may manufacture certain emerging memory technologies in addition to nand flash memory these agreements include a supply agreement for micron to supply us with nand flash memory products we provided approximately 365 million to micron in the second quarter of 2012 primarily for subsequent product purchases under the supply agreement with micron a substantial majority of this 365 million is reflected as a cash flow used for operating activities the agreements also extend our nand joint development program with micron and expand it to include emerging memory technologies additionally the amended agreement provides for certain rights that beginning in 2015 will enable us to sell to micron or enable micron to purchase from us our interest in imft if intel exercises this right micron would set the closing date of the transaction within two years following such election and could elect to receive financing from intel for one to two years  the closing of the joint venture expansion did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income  these joint ventures are variable interest entities all costs of the imft joint venture will be passed on to micron and intel through our purchase agreements our portion of imft and imfs costs primarily related to product purchases and productionrelated services was approximately 705 million during 2012 approximately 985 million during 2011 and approximately 795 million during 2010 subsequent to the sale of our ownership interest in imfs in the second quarter of 2012 we no longer incur costs related to imfs the amount due to imft for product purchases and services provided was approximately 90 million as of december 29 2012 approximately 125 million as of december 31 2011 due to imft and imfs during 2012 imft returned 137

imft depends on micron and intel for any additional cash requirements our known maximum exposure to loss approximated the carrying value of our investment balance in imft as of december 29 2012 except for the amount due to imft for product purchases and services we did not have any additional liabilities recognized on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with our interest in this joint venture as of december 29 2012 in addition our potential future losses could be higher than the carrying amount of our investment as intel and micron are liable for other future operating costs or obligations of imft future cash calls   could also increase our investment balance and the related exposure to loss in addition as we are currently committed to purchasing 49 of imfts production output and productionrelated services we may be required to purchase products at a cost in excess of realizable value  under the accounting standards for consolidating variable interest entities the consolidating investor is the entity with the power to direct the activities of the venture that most significantly impact the ventures economic performance and with the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the venture that could potentially be significant to the venture we have determined that we do not have both of these characteristics therefore we have accounted for our interest in imft and our prior interest in imfs using the equity method of accounting  intelge care innovations llc  in the first quarter of 2011 intel and general electric company ge formed

payments will be due we then matched the benefit payment streams by year to the aa corporate bond rates to match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments and discounted back to the measurement date to determine the appropriate discount rate for the nonus plans we used two approaches to develop the discount rate in certain countries we used a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximated the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans in other countries we analyzed current market longterm bond rates and matched the bond maturity with the average duration of the pension liabilities the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets assumptions takes into consideration both duration and risk of the   investment portfolios and is developed through consensus and buildingblock methodologies the consensus methodology includes unadjusted estimates by the fund manager on future market expectations by broad asset classes and geography the buildingblock approach determines the rates of return implied by historical risk premiums across asset classes in addition we analyzed rates of return relevant to the country where each plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the plan expectations of future returns local actuarial projections and the projected longterm rates of return from external

deemed to be guaranteed by government entities and include instruments such as nonus government bonds us treasury securities and us agency securities corporate bonds include both us and nonus bonds with the majority held in highquality bonds we classified assetbacked securities in the global   bond fund as level 3 as we have used unobservable inputs to the valuations that were significant to the fair value measurements during 2012 approximately 90 million of government bonds and corporate bonds was transferred from level 2 to level 1 primarily based on the increased market activity for the

define a concentration of risk as an undiversified exposure to one of the aforementioned risks that unnecessarily increases the exposure to a loss of plan assets we monitor exposure to such risks in

we used the simplified method of calculating expected life due to significant differences in the vesting terms and contractual life of current   option grants compared to our historical grants in 2011 we began using historical option exercise data as the basis for determining expected life as we believe that we have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the

repurchase up to 45 billion in shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions as of december 29 2012 53 billion remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization limit during 2012 we repurchased 1910 million shares of common stock at a cost of 48 billion 6423 million shares of common stock at a cost of 141 billion in 2011 and 703 million shares of common stock at a cost of 15 billion in 2010 we have repurchased 43 billion shares at a cost of 89 billion since the program began in 1990  restricted stock unit withholdings  we issue restricted stock units as part of our equity incentive plans for the majority of restricted stock units granted the number of shares issued on the date the restricted stock units vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees during 2012 we withheld 126 million shares to satisfy 345 million of employees tax obligations 103 million shares to satisfy 207 million during 2011 and 101 million shares to satisfy 236 million during 2010 although shares withheld are not issued they are treated as common stock repurchases in our consolidated financial statements as they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting     note 24 earnings per share  we computed our basic and diluted

using net income available to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period net income available to participating securities was insignificant for all periods presented  potentially dilutive common shares from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan potentially dilutive common shares are determined by applying the ifconverted method for the 2005 debentures however as our 2009 debentures require settlement of the principal amount of the debt in cash upon conversion with the conversion premium paid in cash or stock at our option potentially dilutive common shares are   determined by applying the treasury stock method for further discussion on the specific conversion features of our 2005 and 2009 debentures see note 19 borrowings  for 2012 we excluded 29 million outstanding weighted average stock options 90 million in 2011 and 161 million in 2010 from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the exercise prices of these stock options were greater than or equal to the average market value of the common shares these options could be included in the calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases and is greater than the exercise price of these options in 2012 and 2011 we included our 2009 debentures in the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the average market price was above the conversion price in 2010 we excluded the 2009 debentures from the calculation of diluted earnings per common share because the conversion option of the debentures was antidilutive we could potentially exclude the 2009 debentures again in the future if the average market price is below the conversion price     85    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued    note 25 comprehensive income  the components of total

present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not materially harm our financial position results of operations cash flows or overall trends legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages in addition in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways precluding particular business practices or requiring other remedies were unfavorable outcomes to occur the possibility exists for a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial position and overall trends we might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders employees and customers and any such settlement could include substantial payments however we have not reached this conclusion with respect to any particular matter at this time  a number of proceedings generally have challenged and continue to challenge certain of our competitive practices the allegations in these proceedings vary and are described in more detail in the following paragraphs in general they contend that we improperly condition price rebates and other discounts on our microprocessors on exclusive or nearexclusive dealing by some of our customers and they allege that our software compiler business unfairly prefers intel microprocessors over competing microprocessors and that through the use of our compilers and other means we have caused the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading     89    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued      benchmark results concerning our microprocessors based on the procedural posture of the various remaining competition matters which we describe in subsequent paragraphs our investment of resources to explain and defend our position has declined as compared to the period 20052011 nonetheless certain of the matters remain active and these challenges could continue for a number of years potentially requiring us to invest additional resources we believe that we compete lawfully and that our marketing business intellectual property and other challenged practices benefit our customers and our stockholders and we will continue to conduct a vigorous defense in the remaining proceedings  government competition matters and related consumer class actions  in 2001 the european commission ec commenced an investigation regarding claims by advanced micro devices inc amd that we used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy our microprocessors we have received numerous requests for information and documents from the ec and we have responded to each of those requests the ec issued a statement of objections in july 2007 and held a hearing on that statement in march 2008 the ec issued a supplemental statement of objections in july 2008  in may 2009 the ec issued a decision finding that we had violated article 82 of the ec treaty and article 54 of the european economic area agreement in general the ec found that we violated article 82 later renumbered as article 102 by a new treaty by offering alleged conditional rebates and payments that required our customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us the ec also found that we violated article 82 by making alleged payments to prevent sales of specific rival products the ec imposed a fine in the amount of 106 billion 1447 billion as of may 2009 which we subsequently paid during the third quarter of 2009 and ordered us to immediately bring to an end the infringement referred to in the ec decision in the second quarter of 2009 we recorded the related charge within marketing general and administrative we strongly disagree with the ecs decision and we appealed the decision to the court of first instance which has been renamed the general court in july 2009 the hearing of our appeal took place on july 3 through july 6 2012 the courts decision is expected in mid to late 2013  the ec decision exceeds 500 pages but contains no specific direction on whether or how we should modify our business practices instead the decision states that we should cease and desist from further conduct that in the ecs opinion would violate applicable law we have taken steps which are subject to the ecs ongoing review to comply with that decision pending appeal we opened discussions with the ec to better understand the decision and to explain changes to   our business practices based on our current understanding and expectations we do not believe that any such changes will be material to our financial position results or cash flows  in june 2005 we received an inquiry from the korea fair trade commission kftc requesting documents from our korean subsidiary related to marketing and rebate programs that we entered into with korean pc manufacturers in february 2006 the kftc initiated an inspection of documents at our offices in korea in september 2007 the kftc served on us an examination report alleging that sales to two customers during parts of 20022005 violated koreas monopoly regulation and fair trade act in december 2007 we submitted our written response to the kftc in february 2008 the kftcs examiner submitted a written reply to our response in march 2008 we submitted a further response in april 2008 we participated in a prehearing conference before the kftc and we participated in formal hearings in may and june 2008 in june 2008 the kftc announced its intent to fine us approximately 25 million for providing discounts to samsung electronics co ltd and trigem computer inc in november 2008 the kftc issued a final written decision concluding that our discounts had violated korean antitrust law and imposing a fine on us of approximately 20 million which we paid in january 2009 in december 2008 we appealed this decision by filing a lawsuit in the seoul high court seeking to overturn the kftcs decision we expect a decision from the court in 2013  at least 82 separate classaction suits have been filed in the us district courts for the northern district of california southern district of california district of idaho district of nebraska district of new mexico district of maine and district of delaware as well as in various california kansas and tennessee state courts these actions generally repeat the allegations made in a nowsettled lawsuit filed against intel by amd in june 2005 in the us district court for the district of delaware amd litigation like the amd litigation these classaction suits allege that we engaged in various actions in violation of the sherman act and other laws by among other things providing discounts and rebates to our manufacturer and distributor customers conditioned on exclusive or nearexclusive dealing that allegedly unfairly interfered with amds ability to sell its microprocessors interfering with certain amd product launches and interfering with amds participation in certain industry standardssetting groups the class actions allege various consumer injuries including that consumers in various states have been injured by paying higher prices for computers containing our microprocessors we dispute these classaction claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously  all of the federal class actions and the kansas and tennessee state court class actions have been transferred by the multidistrict litigation panel to the us district court in delaware for all pretrial proceedings and discovery mdl     90    table of contents intel corporation  notes to consolidated financial statements continued      proceedings the delaware district court has appointed a special master to address issues in the mdl proceedings as assigned by the court in january 2010 the plaintiffs in the delaware action filed a motion for sanctions for our alleged failure to preserve evidence this motion largely copies a motion previously filed by amd in the amd litigation which has settled the plaintiffs in the mdl proceedings also moved for certification of a class of members who purchased certain pcs containing products sold by us in july 2010 the special master issued a report and recommendation class report denying the motion to certify a class the mdl plaintiffs filed objections to the special masters class report and a hearing on those objections was held in march 2011 in september 2012 the court ruled that an evidentiary hearing will be necessary to enable the court to rule on the objections to the special masters class report to resolve the motion to certify the class and to resolve a separate motion to exclude certain testimony and evidence from the mdl plaintiffs expert the hearing is scheduled to occur in july 2013  all california class actions have been consolidated in the superior court of california in santa clara county the plaintiffs in the california actions have moved for class certification which we are in the process of opposing at our request the court in the california actions has agreed to delay ruling on this motion until after the delaware district court rules on the similar motion in the mdl proceedings based on the procedural posture and the nature of these cases including but not limited to the fact that the delaware district court has requested an evidentiary hearing and has not yet ruled on class certification issues we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses if any arising from these matters  lehman matter  in november 2009 representatives of the lehman brothers otc derivatives inc lotc bankruptcy estate advised us informally that the estate was considering a claim against us arising from a 2008 contract between intel and lotc under the terms of the 2008 contract we prepaid 10 billion to lotc in exchange for which lotc was required to purchase and deliver to us the number of shares of intel common stock that could be purchased for 10 billion at the discounted volumeweighted average price specified in the contract for the period september 2 2008 to september 26 2008 lotcs performance under the contract was secured by 10 billion of cash collateral under the terms of the contract lotc was obligated to deliver approximately 50 million shares of our common stock to us on september 29 2008 lotc failed to deliver any shares of our common stock and we exercised our right to setoff against the 10 billion collateral lotc has not initiated any action against us to date but in february 2010 lotc served a subpoena on us in connection with this transaction in october 2010 lotc demanded that we pay it at least 417 million in september 2010 we entered into an agreement with lotc that tolled   any applicable statutes of limitations for 90 days and precluded the parties from commencing any formal proceedings to prosecute any claims against each other in any forum during that period the tolling agreement with lotc was extended several times but lapsed in june 2011 we continue to believe that we acted appropriately under our agreement with lotc and we intend to defend any claim to the contrary no complaint has been filed and we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses if any that might arise from any such complaint  mcafee shareholder litigation  on august 19 2010 we announced that we had agreed to acquire all of mcafees common stock for 4800 per share four mcafee shareholders filed putative classaction lawsuits in santa clara county california superior court challenging the proposed transaction the cases were ordered consolidated in september 2010 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that named former mcafee board members mcafee and intel as defendants and alleged that the mcafee board members breached their fiduciary duties and that mcafee and intel aided and abetted those breaches of duty the complaint requested rescission of the merger agreement such other equitable relief as the court may deem proper and an award of damages in an unspecified amount in june 2012 the plaintiffs damages expert asserted that the value of a mcafee share for the purposes of assessing damages should be 6208  in january 2012 the court certified the action as a class action appointed the central pension laborers fund to act as the class representative and scheduled trial to begin in january 2013 in march 2012 defendants filed a petition with the california court of appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse the class certification order the petition was denied in june 2012 in march 2012 at defendants request the court held that plaintiffs were not entitled to a jury trial and ordered a bench trial in april 2012 plaintiffs filed a petition with the california court of appeal for a writ of mandate to reverse that order which the court of appeal denied in july 2012  in august 2012 defendants filed a motion for summary judgment which was scheduled for hearing on november 2 2012 on november 1 2012 the court issued a tentative ruling granting defendants motion plaintiffs chose not to contest the tentative ruling and the court adopted it as its final ruling on november 6 2012 the trial court entered final judgment in the case on february 13 2013 and plaintiffs have 60 days from the date of the judgment to file any appeal because the resolution of any appeal of this matter may materially impact the scope and nature of the proceeding we cannot make

the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania and a complaint with the us international trade commission itc pursuant to section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 against us and two of our customers apple inc and hewlettpackard company alleging infringement of five patents x2y subsequently added a sixth patent to both actions the district court action is stayed pending resolution of the itc proceeding x2y alleges that at least intel core and intel xeon processor families infringe the asserted patents x2y also requests that the itc issue permanent exclusion and ceaseanddesist orders to among other things prohibit us from importing these microprocessors and apple and hewlettpackard company products that incorporate these microprocessors into the united states in the district court action x2y seeks unspecified damages including enhanced damages for alleged willful infringement and injunctive relief on june 13 2012 the administrative law judge issued an initial determination granting x2ys motion to partially terminate the itc investigation with respect to three of the asserted patents the administrative law judge held a hearing on the remaining three patents in august 2012 and issued an initial determination in december 2012 in the initial determination the administrative law judge found that intel apple and hewlettpackard have not violated section 337 of the tariff act of 1930 because they have not infringed any of the asserted claims of the three patents and ruled that the asserted claims of two of the patents were invalid in december 2012 the parties filed petitions for review of the initial determination by the itc on february 15 2013 the itc determined to review in part the initial determination on review the commission determined to reverse or vacate certain findings and to terminate the investigation with a finding of no violation based on the procedural posture and nature of the cases including but not limited to the fact that monetary damages are not an available remedy in the itc and because discovery regarding x2ys claimed damages has not commenced in the stayed district court action we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses if any arising from these matters we dispute the claims and intend to defend the lawsuits vigorously  note 28 operating segment and geographic information  our
