a result so is our competitive landscape our platforms based on intel architecture are positioned to compete across the spectrum of internetconnected computing devices from the lowestpower portable devices to the most powerful data center servers new competitors are joining traditional competitors in our core pc and server business areas where we are a leading provider while we face incumbent competitors in the adjacent market segments that we are pursuing such as smartphones and tablets competitors include advanced micro devices inc amd international business machines ibm oracle corporation as well as arm architecture licensees from arm limited such as qualcomm incorporated nvidia corporation samsung electronics co ltd and texas instruments incorporated the primary competitor for our mcafee family of security products and services is symantec corporation  we face emerging business model competitors from oems that choose to vertically integrate their own proprietary semiconductor and software assets to some degree such as apple inc and samsung in doing so these oems may be attempting to offer greater differentiation in their products and increase their share of the profits for each finished product they sell unforeseen competitor acquisitions collaborations or licensing scenarios including injunctions or other litigation outcomes could also have a significant impact on our competitive position  our products primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration innovative design features price quality reliability brand recognition and availability one of our important competitive advantages is the combination of our network of manufacturing assembly and test facilities with our global architecture design teams this network enables us to have more direct control over our processes quality control product cost production timing performance and manufacturing yield the increased cost of constructing new fabrication facilities supporting smaller transistor geometries and larger wafers has led to a smaller pool of companies that can afford to build and equip leadingedge manufacturing facilities most of our competitors rely on thirdparty foundries and subcontractors such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd or globalfoundries inc for their manufacturing and assembly and test needs creating among other risks the potential for supply constraints and limited process technology differentiation between competitors using the same foundry  manufacturing and assembly and test  as of december 29 2012 56 of our wafer fabrication including microprocessors and chipsets was conducted within the us at our facilities in new mexico arizona oregon and massachusetts the remaining 44 of our wafer fabrication was conducted outside the us at our facilities in ireland china and israel wafer fabrication conducted within and outside the us is impacted by the timing of a facilitys transition to a newer process technology as well as a facilitys capacity utilization     as of december 29 2012 we primarily manufactured our products in wafer fabrication facilities at the following locations

   as of december 29 2012 most of our microprocessors were manufactured on 300mm wafers using our 22nm and 32nm process technology as we move to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology we incur significant startup costs to prepare each factory for manufacturing however continuing to advance our process technology provides benefits that we believe justify these costs the benefits of moving to each succeeding generation of manufacturing process technology can include using less space per transistor reducing heat output from each   transistor and increasing the number of integrated features on each chip these advancements can result in microprocessors that are higher performing consume less power and cost less to manufacture in addition with each shift to a new process technology we are able to produce more microprocessors per square foot of our wafer fabrication facilities the costs to develop our process technology are significantly less than adding capacity by building additional wafer fabrication facilities using older process technology     7    table of contents  we use thirdparty manufacturing companies foundries to manufacture wafers for

chemical waste byproducts of our manufacturing processes and the environmental impact of our products we currently use a variety of materials in our manufacturing process that have the potential to adversely impact the environment and are subject to a variety of ehs laws and regulations over the past several years we have significantly reduced the use of lead and halogenated flame retardants in our products and manufacturing processes  we work with the us environmental protection agency epa nongovernmental organizations ngos oems and retailers to help manage ewaste including electronic products nearing the end of their useful lives and to promote recycling the european union requires producers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to develop programs that let consumers return products for recycling many states in the us have similar ewaste takeback laws although these laws are typically targeted at the end electronic product and not the component products that we manufacture the inconsistency of many ewaste takeback laws and the lack of local ewaste management options in many areas pose a challenge for our compliance efforts  we are an industry leader in our efforts to build ethical sourcing of minerals for our products including conflict minerals coming out of central africa in 2013 intel will continue to work to establish a conflictfree supply chain for
