domestic product growth was less than expected as we entered 2012 and pc client group revenue was negatively impacted by the growth of tablets as these devices compete with pcs for consumer sales data center group revenue grew 6 in 2012 as a richer mix of products and significant growth in the internet cloud segment was partially offset by weakness in the enterprise market segment our gross margin percentage for 2012 was flat compared to 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs were offset by lower startup costs and no impact in 2012 for the intel 6 series express chipset design issue  our fourth quarter revenue of 135 billion was flat from the third quarter of 2012 historically our revenue generally has increased in the fourth quarter however softness in pc demand and continued decline of inventory in the pc supply chain as oems reduce inventory on oldergeneration products negatively impacted our results for the fourth quarter the decline in our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter was driven by excess capacity charges as we responded to lower demand by bringing down inventory levels and redirecting capital resources to our 14nm process technology our gross margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory reserves on production of our nextgeneration microarchitecture products codenamed haswell which we expect to qualify for sale in the first quarter of 2013  during 2012 we made significant product introductions across all our businesses including pc client servers smartphones and tablets and extended our manufacturing and process technology leadership we launched our nextgeneration serverbased products the intel xeon processor e5 family which provides higher performance and better energyefficiency than priorgeneration products in 2012 we continued to extend our process technology leadership with the introduction of our 22nm process technology products that utilize threedimensional trigate transistor technology these products also improve performance and energy efficiency compared to prior generation products and helped   us accelerate our ultrabook strategy in 2012 we entered the smartphone market segment with six mobile phone providers launching the first intel architecturebased smartphones we are also expanding in the tablet market segment with designs based on android and windows operating systems currently shipping  in a challenging environment our business continues to produce significant cash from operations generating 189 billion in 2012 we returned 44 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchased 48 billion of common stock through our common stock repurchase program in addition we purchased 110 billion in capital assets as we continue to make significant investments to extend our manufacturing leadership during the third quarter of 2012 we also entered into a series of agreements with asml intended to accelerate the development of 450millimeter mm wafer technology and extreme ultraviolet euv lithography the agreements included intels purchase of asml equity securities totaling 32 billion we also took advantage of the low interest rate environment in 2012 and issued 62 billion of senior notes from a financial condition perspective we ended the year with an investment portfolio of 182 billion which consisted of cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and trading assets in january 2013 the board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0225 per common share for the first quarter of 2013  as we look into 2013 we expect revenue to grow in the low single digits with particular strength in our server market segment we believe the renewed innovation in the pc industry that we fostered with ultrabook systems and expanded to other thin and light form factors will blur the lines between tablets and notebooks and provide growth opportunities in 2013 we also expect to launch new socs for smartphones and tablets based on our 22nm process technology in 2013 we expect an increase in capital expenditures primarily driven by beginning construction of a 450mm development facility as we progress toward manufacturing with 450mm wafer technology later in the decade     25    table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued     our

estimates  the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain our most critical accounting estimates include        the valuation of nonmarketable equity investments and the determination of otherthantemporary impairments which impact gains losses on equity investments net when we record impairments        the assessment of recoverability of longlived assets property plant and equipment goodwill and identified intangibles which impacts gross margin or operating expenses when we record asset impairments or accelerate their depreciation or amortization        the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes including the measurement of uncertain tax positions which impact our provision for taxes        the valuation of inventory which impacts gross margin and        the recognition and measurement of loss contingencies which impact gross margin or operating expenses when we recognize a loss contingency revise the estimate for a loss contingency or record an asset impairment  in the following section we discuss these policies further as well as the estimates and judgments involved  nonmarketable equity investments  we regularly invest in nonmarketable equity instruments of private companies which range from earlystage companies that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the carrying value of our nonmarketable equity investment portfolio excluding equity derivatives totaled 22 billion as of december 29 2012 28 billion as of december 31 2011  our nonmarketable equity investments are recorded using the cost method or the equity method of accounting depending on the facts and circumstances of each investment our nonmarketable equity investments are classified within other longterm assets on the consolidated balance sheets  nonmarketable equity investments are inherently risky and their success depends on product development market acceptance operational efficiency the ability of the investee companies to raise additional funds in financial markets that can be volatile and other key business factors the companies could fail or not be able to raise additional funds when needed or they may receive lower valuations with less favorable investment terms than previous financings these events could cause our investments to become impaired in addition financial market volatility could negatively affect our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales for further information about our investment portfolio risks see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k     26    table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued     we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments portfolio quarterly for disclosure purposes however the investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized we determine the fair value of our nonmarketable equity investments using the market and income approaches the market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable public companies such as projected revenues earnings and comparable performance multiples the selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of relevant factors including comparable companies sizes growth rates industries and development stages the income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model which may include one or multiple discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates for the investee revenue expenses capital spending and other costs and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies estimates of revenue expenses capital spending and other costs are developed using available market historical and forecast data the valuation of our nonmarketable equity investments also takes into account variables such as conditions reflected in the capital markets recent financing activities by the investees the investees capital structures the terms of the investees issued interests and the lack of marketability of the investments  for nonmarketable equity investments the measurement of fair value requires significant judgment and includes quantitative and qualitative analysis of identified events or circumstances that impact the fair value of the investment such as        the investees revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects        the technological feasibility of the investees products and technologies        the general market conditions in the investees industry or geographic area including adverse regulatory and economic changes        factors related to the investees ability to remain in business such as the investees liquidity debt ratios and the rate at which the investee is using its cash and        the investees receipt of additional funding at a lower valuation  if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value we determine whether the investment is otherthantemporarily impaired based on our quantitative and qualitative analysis which includes assessing the severity and duration of the impairment and the likelihood of recovery before disposal if the investment is considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired we write down the investment to its fair value impairments of nonmarketable equity investments were 104 million in 2012 over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2012 impairments of non marketable equity investments ranged from 8 million to 59 million per quarter  longlived assets  property plant and equipment  we assess property plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a business or product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets we measure the recoverability of assets that we will continue to use in our operations by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows if an asset groupings carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset groupings carrying value and its fair value property plant and equipment is considered a nonfinancial asset and is recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized  impairments are determined for groups of assets related to the lowest level of identifiable independent cash flows due to our asset usage model and the interchangeable nature of our semiconductor manufacturing capacity we must make subjective judgments in determining the independent cash flows that can be related to specific asset groupings in addition as we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets primarily processspecific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation over the assets new shorter useful lives over the past 12 quarters including the fourth quarter of 2012 impairments and accelerated depreciation of property plant and equipment ranged from zero to 36 million per quarter  goodwill  goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on relative fair value of the future benefit of the purchased operations to our existing business units as well as the acquired business unit reporting units may be operating segments as a whole or an operation one level below an operating segment referred to as a component our reporting units are consistent with the operating segments identified in note 28 operating segment and geographic information in part ii item 8 of this form 10k     27    table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued     we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value for reporting units in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations overall financial performance and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit  for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform additional testing if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill if we determine during this second step that the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the difference  determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting of the income method and the market method to estimate the reporting units fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses the following reporting unit estimates revenue based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share estimated costs and appropriate discount rates based on the reporting units weighted average cost of capital as determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies our estimates of market segment growth our market segment share and costs are based on historical data various internal estimates and a variety of external sources these estimates are developed as part of our routine longrange planning process the same estimates are also used in planning for our longterm manufacturing and assembly and test capacity needs as part of our capital budgeting process and for longterm and shortterm business planning and forecasting we test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium the reporting units carrying value represents the assignment of various assets and liabilities excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities such as cash investments and debt  for the annual impairment assessment in 2012 we determined that for each of our reporting units with significant amounts of goodwill it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value as a result we concluded that performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test was not necessary for those reporting units during the fourth quarter of each of the prior three fiscal years we completed our annual impairment assessments and concluded that goodwill was not impaired in any of these years  identified intangibles  we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased finitelived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of finitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate we perform an annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinitelived intangible assets or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable recoverability of indefinitelived intangible assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if we determine that an individual asset is impaired the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset  the assumptions and estimates used to determine future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible and other longlived assets are complex and subjective they can be affected by various factors including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our forecasts for specific product lines based on our impairment reviews of our intangible assets we recognized impairment charges of 21 million in 2012 10 million in 2011 and no impairment charges in 2010  income taxes  we must make estimates and judgments in determining the provision for taxes for financial statement purposes these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits benefits and deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes as well as the interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions significant changes in these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period     28    table of contents managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued     we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets however should a change occur in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely recovery of a portion of our deferred tax assets is impacted by managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of certain investments therefore changes in managements plans with respect to holding or disposing of investments could affect our future provision for taxes  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any if we determine that a tax position will more likely than not be sustained on audit the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factors such as changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law new audit activity and effectively settled issues determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision  inventory  the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products the estimate of future demand is compared to workinprocess and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory as of december 29 2012 we had total workinprocess inventory of 22 billion and total finished goods inventory of 20 billion the demand forecast is included in the development of our shortterm manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decisions productspecific facts and circumstances reviewed in the inventory valuation process include a review of our customer base the   stage of the product life cycle of our products consumer confidence and customer acceptance of our products as well as an assessment of the selling price in relation to the product cost if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin  to determine which costs can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine normal capacity at our manufacturing and assembly and test facilities based on historical loadings compared to total available capacity if the factory loadings are below the established normal capacity level a portion of our manufacturing overhead costs would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized as cost of sales in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these costs as excess capacity charges in the fourth quarter of 2012 excess capacity charges were 480 million in the previous 11 quarters excess capacity charges were less than 50 million in each quarter  loss contingencies  we are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and asserted and potential claims as well as accruals related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product errata and product warranties and potential asset impairments loss contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred the outcomes of legal and administrative proceedings and claims and the estimation of product warranties and asset impairments are subject to significant uncertainty significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable with respect to estimating the losses associated with repairing and replacing parts in connection with product errata we make judgments with respect to customer return rates costs to repair or replace parts and where the product is in our customers manufacturing process at least quarterly we review the status of each significant matter and we may revise our estimates these revisions

              our net revenue for 2012 which included 52 weeks decreased by 658 million or 1 compared to 2011 which included 53 weeks pc client group and data center group platform volume decreased 1 while average selling prices were unchanged additionally lower imc average selling prices and lower netbook platform volume contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by our mcafee operating segment which we acquired in the first quarter of 2011 mcafee contributed 469 million of additional revenue in 2012 compared to 2011  our overall gross margin dollars for 2012 decreased by 606 million or 2 compared to 2011 the decrease was due in large part to approximately 490 million of excess capacity charges as well as lower pc client group and data center group platform revenue to a lesser extent higher pc client group and data center group platform unit costs as well as lower netbook and imc revenue contributed to the decrease the decrease was partially offset by approximately 645 million of lower startup costs as we transition from our 22nm process technology to rampd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology as well as 422 million of charges recorded in 2011 to repair and replace materials and systems impacted by a design issue related to our intel 6 series express chipset family the decrease was also partially offset by the two additional months of results from our acquisition of mcafee which occurred on february 28 2011 contributing approximately 334 million of additional gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 2011 the amortization of acquisitionrelated intangibles resulted in a 557 million   reduction to our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 compared to 482 million in 2011 primarily due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011  our overall gross margin percentage in 2012 was flat from 2011 as higher excess capacity charges and higher pc client group and data center group platform unit costs in 2012 were offset by lower startup costs and no impact in 2012 for the intel 6 series express chipset design issue we derived a substantial majority of our overall gross margin dollars in 2012 and 2011 from the sale of platforms in the pc client group and data center group operating segments  our net revenue for 2011 which included 53 weeks increased 104 billion or 24 compared to 2010 which included 52 weeks pc client group and data center group platform revenue increased 63 billion on 8 higher average selling prices and 7 higher unit sales additionally 36 billion of the increase in revenue was due to acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011 primarily imc and mcafee  our overall gross margin dollars for 2011 increased 53 billion or 18 compared to 2010 primarily reflecting higher revenue from our existing business and our acquisitions as discussed previously the increase was partially offset by approximately 10 billion of higher startup costs compared to 2010 the amortization

were partially offset by a 4 increase in desktop platform average selling prices and a 2 increase in notebook platform volume  operating income decreased by 17 billion or 12 in 2012 compared to 2011 driven by 649 million of lower gross margin and 11 billion of higher operating expenses the   decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower platform revenue additionally approximately 455 million of higher excess capacity charges and higher platform unit costs contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by approximately 785 million of lower startup costs as we transition from manufacturing startup costs related to our 22nm process technology to rampd of our nextgeneration 14nm process technology additionally the first half of 2011 included 422 million of

for our acquisition of mcafee in the first quarter of 2011 and an increase in capital expenditures the significant increase in capital expenditures in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to the expansion of

financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock payment of dividends to stockholders issuance and repayment of longterm debt and proceeds from the sale of shares through employee
