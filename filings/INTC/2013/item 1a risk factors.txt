  changes in product demand may harm our financial results and are hard to predict  if product demand decreases our revenue and profit could be harmed important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in        business conditions including downturns in the computing industry regional economies and the overall economy        consumer confidence or income levels caused by changes in market conditions including changes in government borrowing taxation or spending policies the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity prices        the level of customers inventories        competitive and pricing pressures including actions taken by competitors        customer product needs        market acceptance of our products and maturing product cycles and        the technology supply chain including supply constraints caused by natural disasters or other events  our operations have high costsincluding costs related to facility construction and equipment rampd and employment and training of a highly skilled workforcethat are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term at the same time demand for our products is highly variable if product demand decreases or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charges which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our longlived assets which would increase our expenses factoryplanning decisions may shorten the useful lives of facilities and equipment and cause us to accelerate depreciation if product demand increases we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand these changes in product demand and changes in our customers product needs could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce our revenue increase our costs lower our gross margin percentage or require us to write down our assets  we operate in highly competitive industries and our failure to anticipate and respond to technological and market developments could harm our ability to compete  we operate in highly competitive industries that experience rapid technological and market developments changes in industry standards changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements if we are unable to   anticipate and respond to these developments we may weaken our competitive position and our products or technologies may be uncompetitive or obsolete as computing market segments emerge such as smartphones tablets and consumer electronics devices we face new sources of competition and customers with different needs than customers in our pc business some of our competitors in these market segments are pursuing a vertical integration strategy incorporating their soc solutions into the smartphones and tablets they offer which could make it less likely that they will adopt our soc solutions to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationships in these market segments as the number and variety of internetconnected devices increase we need to improve the cost connectivity energy efficiency and security of our platforms to succeed in these market segments and we need to expand our software capabilities to provide customers with comprehensive computing solutions  to compete successfully we must maintain a successful rampd effort develop new products and production processes and improve our existing products and processes ahead of competitors our rampd efforts are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problems and we do not expect all of our projects to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new products successfully and the products we invest in and develop may not be well received by customers additionally the products and technologies offered by others may affect demand for our products these types of events could negatively affect our competitive position and may reduce revenue increase costs lower gross margin percentage or require us to impair our assets  changes in the mix of products sold may harm our financial results  because of the wide price differences of platform average selling prices among our data center pc client and other intel architecture platforms a change in the mix of platforms among these market segments may impact our revenue and gross margin for example our pc client platforms that are incorporated in notebook and desktop computers tend to have lower average selling prices and gross margin than our data center platforms that are incorporated in servers workstations and storage products therefore if there is less demand for our data center platforms and a resulting mix shift to our pc client platforms our gross margins and revenue would decrease also more recently introduced products tend to have higher costs because of initial development costs and lower production volumes relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin     14    table of contents  our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition  we have sales offices rampd manufacturing assembly and test facilities and other facilities in many countries and some business activities may be concentrated in one or more geographic areas as a result our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell products may be affected by        security concerns such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest crime political instability and terrorist activity        natural disasters and health concerns        inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions such as supply chain interruptions and largescale outages or interruptions of service from utilities transportation or telecommunications providers        restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings        differing employment practices and labor issues and        local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and other anticorruption laws and regulations  legal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws our employees contractors or agents may violate our policies  although most of our sales occur in us dollars expenses such as payroll utilities tax and marketing expenses may be paid in local currencies we also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies our hedging programs reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements therefore changes in exchange rates could harm our results of operations and financial condition changes in tariff and import regulations and in us and nonus monetary policies may harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our expenses and reducing revenue differing tax rates in various jurisdictions could harm our results of operations and financial condition by increasing our overall tax rate  we maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property casualty and other risks we place our insurance coverage with multiple carriers in numerous jurisdictions however one or more of our insurance providers may be   unable or unwilling to pay a claim the types and amounts of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decisions with respect to risk retention the policies have deductibles and exclusions that result in us retaining a level of selfinsurance losses not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our results of operations and financial condition  failure to meet our production targets resulting in undersupply or oversupply of products may harm our business and results of operations  production of integrated circuits is a complex process disruptions in this process can result from errors difficulties in our development and implementation of new processes defects in materials disruptions in our supply of materials or resources and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents maintenance issues or unsafe working conditionsall of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production processes production issues may result in our failure to meet or increase production as desired resulting in higher costs or large decreases in yields which could affect our ability to produce sufficient volume to meet product demand the unavailability or reduced availability of products could make it more difficult to deliver computing platforms the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations  we may have difficulties obtaining the resources or products we need for manufacturing assembling and testing our products or operating other aspects of our business which could harm our ability to meet demand and increase our costs  we have thousands of suppliers providing materials that we use in production and other aspects of our business and where possible we seek to have several sources of supply for all of those materials however we may rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers or upon suppliers in a single location for these materials the inability of suppliers to deliver adequate supplies of production materials or other supplies could disrupt our production processes or make it more difficult for us to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resources used in production such as water silicon electricity gases and other materials future environmental regulations could restrict the supply or increase the cost of materials that we use in our business and make it more difficult to obtain permits to build or modify manufacturing capacity to meet demand the unavailability or reduced availability of materials or resources may require us to reduce production or incur additional costs the occurrence of these events could harm our business and results of operations     15    table of contents  costs related to product defects and errata may harm our results of operations and business  costs of product defects and errata deviations from published specifications due to for example problems in our design and manufacturing processes could include        writing off the value of inventory        disposing of products that cannot be fixed        recalling products that have been shipped        providing product replacements or modifications and        defending against litigation  these costs could be large and may increase expenses and lower gross margin our reputation with customers or end users could be damaged as a result of product defects and errata and product demand could be reduced the announcement of product defects and errata could cause customers to purchase products from competitors as a result of possible shortages of intel components or for other reasons these factors could harm our business and financial results  third parties might attempt to breach our network security and our products and services which could damage our reputation and financial results  we regularly face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it systems additionally malicious hackers may attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the processes of hardware and software products that we manufacture and services we provide these attempts might be the result of industrial or other espionage or actions by hackers seeking to harm our company our products and services or users of our products and services due to the widespread use of our products and due to the high profile of our mcafee subsidiary we or our products and services are a frequent target of computer hackers and organizations that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other processes products and services we are also a target of malicious attackers who attempt to gain access to our network or data centers or those of our customers or end users steal proprietary information related to our business products employees and customers or interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others we believe such attempts are increasing in number and in technical sophistication these attacks are sometimes successful and in some instances we our customers and the users of our products and services might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects we seek to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools andor changes or patches to our products and services but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful such attacks   whether successful or unsuccessful could result in our incurring costs related to for example rebuilding internal systems reduced inventory value providing modifications to our products and services defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiries or actions paying damages or taking other remedial steps with respect to third parties publicity about vulnerabilities and attempted or successful incursions could damage our reputation with customers or users and reduce demand for our products and services  we may be subject to theft loss or misuse of personal data about us or our customers or other third parties which could increase our expenses damage our reputation or result in litigation  global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity are rapidly expanding and creating a complex compliance environment the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by us to run our business could result in increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims costs to comply with and implement privacyrelated and data protection measures could be significant our failure to comply with federal state or international privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others  third parties may claim infringement of ip rights which could harm our business  we may face ip rights infringement claims from individuals and companies including those who have acquired patent portfolios to assert claims against other companies we are engaged in a number of litigation matters involving ip rights claims that our products or processes infringe the ip rights of others could cause us to incur large costs to respond to defend and resolve the claims and they may divert the efforts and attention of management and technical personnel as a result of ip rights infringement claims we could        pay infringement claims        stop manufacturing using or selling products or technology subject to infringement claims        develop other products or technology not subject to infringement claims which could be timeconsuming costly or impossible or        license technology from the party claiming infringement which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  these actions could harm our competitive position result in expenses or require us to impair our assets if we alter or stop production of affected items our revenue could be harmed     16    table of contents  we may be unable to enforce or protect our ip rights which may harm our ability to compete and may harm our business  our ability to enforce our patents copyrights software licenses and other ip rights is subject to general litigation risks as well as uncertainty as to the enforceability of our ip rights in various countries when we seek to enforce our rights we are often subject to claims that the ip rights are invalid not enforceable or licensed to the opposing party our assertion of ip rights often results in the other party seeking to assert claims against us which could harm our business governments may adopt regulationsand governments or courts may render decisionsrequiring compulsory licensing of ip rights or governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies our inability to enforce our ip rights under these circumstances may harm our competitive position and business  we may be subject to ip theft or misuse which could result in claims against us and harm our business and results of operations  the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products the value of our investment in rampd product development and marketing could be reduced and third parties might make claims against us related to losses of confidential or proprietary information or enduser data or system reliability these incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business and we could suffer losses including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm  our licenses with other companies and participation in industry initiatives may allow competitors to use our patent rights  companies in the computing industry often bilaterally license patents between each other to settle disputes or as part of business agreements between them our competitors may have licenses to our patents and under current case law some of the licenses may permit these competitors to pass our patent rights on to others under some circumstances our participation in industry standards organizations or with other industry initiatives may require us to license our patents to companies that adopt industrystandard specifications depending on the rules of the organization we might have to grant these licenses to our patents for little or no cost and as a result we may be unable to enforce certain patents against others our costs of enforcing our licenses or protecting our patents may increase and the value of our ip rights may be impaired  litigation or regulatory proceedings could harm our business  we may face legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder consumer competition and other issues on a global basis as described in note 27 contingencies in part ii item 8

damages or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling products engaging in business practices or requiring other remedies such as compulsory licensing of patents  we face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties  we sell a portion of our products through third parties such as distributors valueadded resellers oems internet service providers and channel partners collectively referred to as distributors using third parties for distribution exposes us to many risks including competitive pressure concentration credit risk and compliance risks distributors may sell products that compete with our products and we may need to provide financial and other incentives to focus distributors on the sale of our products we may rely on one or more key distributors for a product and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue distributors may face financial difficulties including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of accounts receivable and financial results violations of fcpa or similar laws by distributors or other thirdparty intermediaries could have a material impact on our business failing to manage risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales increase expenses and weaken our competitive position  we face risks related to sales to government entities  we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to government entities and their respective agencies government demand and payment for our products may be affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations government contracts are subject to oversight including special rules on accounting expenses reviews and security failing to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions including termination of contracts fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business  we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments  we make investments in companies around the world to further our strategic objectives and support key business initiatives these investments include equity or debt instruments of public or private companies and many of these instruments are nonmarketable at the time of our initial investment companies range from earlystage companies that are still defining their strategic direction to more mature companies with established revenue streams and business models the companies in which we invest may fail because they are unable to secure additional funding obtain favorable terms for future financings or participate in liquidity events such as public offerings mergers and private sales if any of these companies fail we could lose all or part of our investment if we determine that an otherthantemporary decline in the fair value exists for an investment we write down the investment to its fair value and recognize a loss impacting gains losses on equity investments net the majority of our marketable equity security portfolio balance is concentrated in asml and declines in the value of our asml holdings could result in impairment charges impacting gains losses on equity

processes  climate change poses both regulatory and physical risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business  in addition to the possible direct economic impact that climate change could have on us climate change mitigation programs and regulations can increase our costs the cost of perfluorocompounds pfcsa gas that we use in manufacturingcould increase under some climatechangefocused emissions trading programs that may be imposed through regulation if the use of pfcs is prohibited we would need to obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations airquality permit requirements for our manufacturing operations could become more burdensome and cause delays in our ability to modify or build additional manufacturing capacity under recently adopted greenhouse gas regulations in the us many of our manufacturing facilities have become major sources under the clean air act at a minimum this change in status results in some uncertainty as the epa adopts guidance on its greenhouse gas regulations due to the dynamic nature of our operations these regulations will likely result in increased costs for our us operations these cost increases could be associated with new air pollution control requirements and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions we also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by   climate change regulations our costs could increase if utility companies pass on their costs such as those associated with carbon taxes emission cap and trade programs or renewable portfolio standards while we maintain business recovery plans that are intended to allow us to recover from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business we cannot be sure that our plans will fully protect us from all such disasters or events many of our operations are located in semiarid regions such as israel and the southwestern us some scenarios predict that these regions may become even more vulnerable to prolonged droughts due to climate change  in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate key employees and our failure to do so could harm our results of operations  in order to compete we must attract retain and motivate executives and other key employees hiring and retaining qualified executives scientists
