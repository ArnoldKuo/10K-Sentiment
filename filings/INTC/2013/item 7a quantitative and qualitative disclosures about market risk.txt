  we are directly and indirectly affected by changes in nonus currency exchange rates interest rates and equity prices all of the potential changes that follow are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial positions as of december 29 2012 and december 31 2011 actual results may differ materially  currency exchange rates  in general we economically hedge currency risks of nonusdollardenominated investments in debt instruments and loans receivable with currency forward contracts or currency interest rate swaps gains and losses on these nonuscurrency investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss  substantially all of our revenue is transacted in us dollars however a significant amount of our operating expenditures and capital purchases is incurred in or exposed to other currencies primarily the euro the japanese yen and the israeli shekel we have established balance sheet and forecasted transaction currency risk management programs to protect against fluctuations in fair value and the volatility of the functional currency equivalent of future cash flows caused by changes in exchange rates we generally utilize currency forward contracts in these hedging programs our hedging programs reduce but do not always eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements for further information see risk factors in part i item 1a of this form 10k we considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that a weighted average adverse change of 20 in currency exchange rates could be experienced in the near term such an adverse change after taking into account balance sheet hedges only and offsetting recorded monetary asset and liability positions would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of less than 80 million as of december 29 2012 less than 40 million as of december 31 2011  interest rates  we generally hedge interest rate risks of fixedrate debt instruments with interest rate swaps gains and losses on these investments would generally be offset by corresponding losses and gains on the related hedging instruments resulting in an insignificant net exposure to interest rate loss  we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio and indebtedness our indebtedness includes our debt issuances and the liability associated with a longterm patent crosslicense agreement with nvidia the primary objective of our investments in debt instruments is to preserve principal while maximizing yields which generally track the usdollar threemonth libor a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 10 would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our indebtedness of approximately 15 billion as of december 29 2012 an increase of approximately 900 million as of december 31 2011 the significant increase from december 31 2011 was primarily driven by the inclusion of 62 billion of senior unsecured notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2012 a hypothetical decrease in benchmark interest rates of up to 10 after taking into account investment hedges would have resulted in an increase in the fair value of our investment portfolio of approximately 10 million as of december 29 2012 an increase of approximately 20 million as of december 31 2011 the fluctuations in fair value of our investment portfolio and indebtedness reflect only the direct impact of the change in interest rates other economic variables such as equity market fluctuations and changes in relative credit risk could result in a significantly higher decline in the fair value of our net investment position for further information on how credit risk is factored into the valuation of our investment portfolio and debt issuances see note 4 fair value in part ii item 8 of this form 10k  equity prices  our investments include marketable equity securities and equity derivative instruments such as warrants and options we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activities however for our investments in strategic equity derivative instruments we may enter into transactions to reduce or eliminate the equity market risks additionally for our securities that we no longer consider strategic we evaluate legal market and economic factors in our decision on the timing of disposal and whether it is possible and appropriate to hedge the equity market risk  we hold derivative instruments that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements the gains and losses from changes in fair value of these derivatives are designed to offset the losses and gains on the related liabilities resulting in an insignificant net exposure to loss     41    table of contents  as of december 29 2012 the fair value of our marketable equity investments and our equity derivative instruments including hedging positions was 44 billion 585 million as of december 31 2011 our marketable equity investment in asml was carried at a total fair market value of 40 billion or 90 of our marketable equity portfolio as of december 29 2012 our marketable equity method investments are excluded from our analysis as the carrying value does not fluctuate based on market price changes unless an otherthantemporary impairment is deemed necessary to determine reasonably possible decreases in the market value of our marketable equity investments we have analyzed the expected market price sensitivity of our marketable equity investment portfolio assuming a loss of 35 in market prices and after reflecting the impact of hedges and offsetting positions the aggregate value of our marketable equity investments could decrease by approximately 16 billion based on the value as of december 29 2012 a decrease in value of approximately 265 million based on the value as of december 31 2011 using an assumed loss of 45  many of the same factors that could result in an adverse movement of equity market prices affect our nonmarketable equity investments although we cannot always quantify the impact directly financial markets are volatile which could negatively affect the prospects of the companies we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investments through liquidity events such as initial public offerings mergers and private sales these types of investments involve a great deal of risk and there can be no assurance that any specific company will grow or become successful consequently we could lose all or part of our investment our nonmarketable equity investments excluding investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying amount of 12 billion as of december 29 2012 11 billion as of december 31 2011 as of december 29 2012 the carrying amount of our nonmarketable equity method investments was 10 billion 16 billion as of december 31 2011 the majority of the total nonmarketable equity method investments
