organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc national response corporation nrc and oil spill response osr cga is a regional spill response organization and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain an underwater well control incident in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osr are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 300000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committee of cga and the board of directors of osr    11    table of contents the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes  insurance coverage and indemnification  the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages  the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporations property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 225 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 1 billion  other insurance policies provide coverage for among other things charterers legal liability in the amount of 500 million per occurrence and aircraft liability in the amount of 300 million per occurrence  the corporations insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable  generally the corporations drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis  the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of fault including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount  under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable however under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the governmental entity is joint and several  environmental  compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition or results of operations the corporation spent 19 million in 2012 for environmental remediation the corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements of approximately 75 million in 2013 and approximately 60 million in 2014 for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    12    table of contents number of

business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future  our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity  if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others  there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties    13    table of contents  results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors  we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations under joint operating agreements in which we may share control with other parties to the agreement there is a risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or these parties may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone if we fail to jointly control operations business decisions and other actions the value of our investment may be adversely affected  we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs the doddfrank wall street reform act enacted in 2010 doddfrank act delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the act to various us government agencies our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final rules under this act including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions on august 22 2012 the securities and exchange commission issued final rules as required by the doddfrank act regarding disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers pursuant to which beginning in 2014 we will be required to provide information about payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil natural gas or minerals  political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry  our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage for example the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general  concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporations operations in france  concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we market petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of    14    table of contents  greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns  our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs  catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks during 2012 we incurred charges for repairs and other expenses relating to the effects of hurricane sandy which hit the northeast coast of the united states although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable  item 3 legal proceedings  the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire two separate cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation  the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion for all parties based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages  on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor    15    table of contents  incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposes total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations  in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint  the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation    16    table of contents part ii      item 5

and results of operations  overview  hess corporation and its subsidiaries the corporation or hess operate in two segments exploration and production eampp and marketing and refining mampr the corporation has made significant progress in its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominantly eampp company following the shutdown of the hovensa llc hovensa joint venture refinery in january 2012 and its decision in january 2013 to cease refining operations at its port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network following these actions over 90 percent of the corporations capital employed will be in its eampp segment the corporation also has shifted its eampp growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller more focused exploratory program the corporation intends to continue to pursue its strategy of transforming itself into an essentially eampp business focused on the corporations most promising properties and operations  on january 29 2013 elliott management corporation elliott sent a letter to hess shareholders informing them that affiliates of elliott beneficially own 4 percent of the outstanding common stock of the corporation and are nominating five individuals for election

equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past see the average selling prices table  united states crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production in the united states was higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play in the second quarter of 2012 production restarted from a well at the llano field after a successful workover of the well which had been shutin for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production was higher in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play partly offset by lower production due to the shutin well at the llano field natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to this shutin well at the llano field  europe crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011 primarily due to downtime at the valhall field in norway which was shutin from midjuly 2012 until january 2013 in order to complete a field redevelopment project crude oil production in 2011 was comparable to 2010 as higher production from norway and russia was largely offset by lower production from the corporations united kingdom north sea assets natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the sale of the snohvit field offshore norway in january 2012 downtime at the valhall field as noted above and natural decline at the beryl field in the united kingdom north sea natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the sale in february 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the united kingdom north sea    24    table of contents africa crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to the resumption of production in libya partly offset by lower production in equatorial guinea due to downtime and natural field decline following the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed in response to civil unrest the corporations production in libya resumed during the fourth quarter of 2011 after being shutin from the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in libya the exchange in september 2010 of the corporations interests in gabon for increased interests in norway lower production entitlement in equatorial guinea and algeria as a result of higher selling prices and natural decline in equatorial guinea  asia and other natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011 primarily due to new wells at the pangkah field in indonesia and a full years contribution from the gajah baru complex at the natuna a field in indonesia which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011 natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010 primarily due to higher nominations at block pm301 in malaysia and first production from the gajah baru complex  sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 1225 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately 1100 million in 2011 compared with 2010  operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 401 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and increased by 460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the bakken oil shale play and in russia together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the valhall field in norway the llano field in the united states and the bakken the increase in costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices together with higher operating and maintenance expenses mainly in norway and the bakken  depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 548 million in 2012 and 83 million in 2011 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs the increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher per barrel costs reflecting higher finding and development costs in addition the higher per barrel rates in 2012 and 2011 were largely due to greater production contribution from unconventional assets  excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 2063 in 2012 1971 in 2011 and 1445 in 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1920 in 2012 1706 in 2011 and 1456 in 2010 for 2013 cash operating costs are estimated to be in the range of 2100 to 2200 per barrel and depreciation depletion and amortization costs are estimated to be in the range of 1900 to 2000 per barrel resulting in total unit costs of 4000 to 4200 per barrel of oil equivalent  exploration expenses exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells ness deep in the gulf of mexico and ajek1 offshore indonesia exploration expenses increased in 2011 from 2010 mainly due to higher dry hole expenses which included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the semai v block offshore indonesia and a well in the north red sea block 1 offshore egypt

prices  the table also reflects future capital expenditures including the portion of the corporations planned 68 billion capital investment program for 2013 that was contractually committed at december 31 2012 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2012 including asset retirement obligations pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions  the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations drilling rigs tankers office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases  the corporation has a contingent purchase obligation to acquire the remaining interest in wilcohess a retail gasoline station joint venture this contingent obligation which expires in april 2014 was approximately 210 million at december 31 2012    31    table of contents the corporation is contingently liable under 141 million of letters of credit of other entities directly related to its business at december 31 2012  offbalance sheet arrangements  the corporation has leveraged leases not included in its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the corporation operates the net present value of these leases is 342 million at december 31 2012 compared with 388 million at december 31 2011 if these leases were included as

foreign operations  the corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the united states principally in algeria australia azerbaijan brunei china denmark equatorial guinea france ghana indonesia the kurdistan region of iraq libya malaysia norway russia thailand and the united kingdom therefore the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk  see also item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  accounting policies  critical accounting policies and estimates  accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporations consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity  accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill  for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior    32    table of contents  management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporations total proved reserves  impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures  the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  the corporations impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly  the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed the corporation has concluded that the eampp segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment since the eampp segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment  if any of the eampp segment components such as our financial reporting regions united states europe africa and asia were considered to be reporting units an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill asc 3502035 if components are economically similar that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit while the corporation believes that the eampp segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting asc 280105011 and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons            the corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single global business          each component produces oil and gas          the exploration and production processes are similar in each component          the methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar          customers of each component are similar          the components share technical resources and support services  if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units  the corporations fair value estimate of the eampp segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential    33    table of contents  synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar eampp companies  the determination of the fair value of the eampp segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the eampp segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill  as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the eampp segment  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination  the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporations internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values  retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future    34    table of contents  returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporations financial statements  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy    35    table of contents details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  environment health and safety  the corporations long term vision and values

last several years many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agencys epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements in april 2012 the corporation entered into a consent decree with the epa to resolve these matters as they relate to its port reading refinery facility under the terms of the consent decree hess paid a penalty of 850000 and agreed to implement a program to reduce emissions at the refinery the emissions reduction program in the consent decree is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation in january 2013 the corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in february at its port reading facility  the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation assesses monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations

expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party    36    table of contents the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2012 the corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 55 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporations remediation spending was 19 million in 2012 19 million in 2011 and 13 million in 2010 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were approximately 70 million in 2012 95 million in 2011 and 85 million in 2010

corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporations senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporations risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipvs of sources of fair values validations of valuation models and analyzes changes in fair value measurements on a daily monthly andor quarterly basis these controls apply to all of the corporations risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable  the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the

or lower costs related to sales contracts with customers  corporate risk management corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil refined petroleum products or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporations crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating  the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies including the british pound and the thai baht at december 31 2012 the

corporation or hess operate in two segments exploration and production eampp and marketing and refining mampr the eampp segment explores for develops produces purchases transports and sells crude oil and natural gas the mampr segment purchases markets and trades refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation also operates terminals and retail gasoline stations most of which include convenience stores that are located on the east coast of the united states through february 2013 the corporation also manufactured refined petroleum products in january 2013 the corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations at its port reading facility in february and pursue the sale of its terminal network in january 2012 hovensa llc hovensa a 50 owned joint venture in the us virgin islands shut down its refinery hovensa plans to operate the complex as an oil storage terminal while the corporation and its joint venture partner pursue a sale of hovensa  the corporation has made significant progress in its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominantly eampp company following the shutdown of the hovensa joint venture refinery and its decision to cease refining operations at its port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network the corporation has also shifted its eampp growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller more focused exploratory program principles of consolidation and basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hess corporation and entities in which the corporation owns more than a 50 voting interest or entities that the corporation controls the corporation consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50 voting interest and over which it exercises control the corporations undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately consolidated investments in affiliated companies 20 to 50 owned and where the corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate are accounted for using the equity method certain information in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the preparation of these financial statements the corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance  estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income actual results could differ from those estimates among the estimates made by management are oil and gas reserves asset valuations depreciable lives pension liabilities legal and environmental obligations asset retirement obligations and income taxes  revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to the customer sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the statement of consolidated income the corporation recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and the corporations share of natural gas production are not material revenues from natural gas and electricity sales by the corporations marketing operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated deliveries to customers since the last meter reading  in its eampp activities the corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality similarly in its marketing activities the corporation enters into refined petroleum product purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred    49    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization the corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives retail gas stations and equipment related to a leased property are depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period the corporation records the cost of acquired customers in its energy marketing activities as intangible assets and amortizes these costs on the straightline method over the expected renewal period based on historical experience  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the net present value of future cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable this impairment test is calculated at the reporting unit level which for the corporations goodwill is the eampp operating segment the corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount an impairment would be recorded  cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for refined petroleum product inventories valued at cost the corporation uses principally the lastin firstout lifo inventory method for the remaining inventories cost is generally determined using average actual costs    50    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method the corporation regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets the available carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in addition the corporation recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations the corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with longlived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets  retirement plans the corporation recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by gaap these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which    51    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued     generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation enters into contracts to sell natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 there may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more liquid markets which are therefore classified as level 1 or level 2 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  sharebased compensation the fair value of all sharebased compensation is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards  foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency primary currency in which business is conducted for most foreign operations adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency into the functional currency are recorded in other net in the statement of consolidated income for operations that do not use the us dollar as the functional currency adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are recorded in a separate component of equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss  maintenance and repairs maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred including costs of refinery turnarounds capital improvements are recorded as additions in property plant and equipment  environmental expenditures the corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable the corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment  changes in accounting policies effective january 1 2012 the

based on the maturity of the reservoir the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate the stage of reservoir development and the production history where applicable reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation as defined in the sec regulations these technologies including computational methods must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in order for reserves to be classified as proved any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project either senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the development the corporations proved reserves are subject

maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation process which are administered by the corporations senior vice president of eampp technology and its chief financial officer estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions and methodologies each year reserve estimates for a selection of the corporations assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews in addition an independent third party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the corporations reported reserves see below reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the board of directors  qualifications  the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the corporations oil and gas reserves is mr scott heck senior vice president of eampp technology mr heck is a member of the society of petroleum engineers and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a bs degree in petroleum engineering his experience includes over 15 years primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas the corporations upstream technology organization which mr heck manages focuses on oil and gas industry subsurface and reservoir engineering technologies and evaluation techniques mr heck is also responsible for the corporations global reserves group which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews  reserves audit  the corporation engaged the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dampm to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 76 of 2012 yearend reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 81 in 2011 the purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with sec regulations the dampm letter report dated january 31 2013 on the corporations estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry dampm is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years dampms letter report on the corporations december 31 2012 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this form 10k while the dampm report should be read in its entirety the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by dampm the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by
