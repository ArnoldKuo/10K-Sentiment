portion of the corporations planned capital expenditure program for 2014 that was contractually committed at december 31 2013 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for transportation seismic purchases oil and gas production expenses and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 including asset retirement obligations pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions  the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease gasoline stations drilling rigs tankers office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases  the corporation is contingently liable under 117 million of letters of credit of other entities directly related to its business at december 31 2013    34    table of contents offbalance sheet arrangements  the corporation has leveraged leases not included in its consolidated balance sheet primarily related to retail gasoline stations that the corporation operates the net present value of these leases is 238 million at december 31 2013 compared with 342 million at december 31 2012 in connection with the planned divestiture of its retail operations the corporation plans to either buyout these leveraged leases or sublet the retail gas stations to the divested operations the corporation estimates that it will incur an aftertax charge of approximately 100 million in connection with a buyout or sublet of the leases if these leases were included as debt the corporations december 31 2013 debt to capitalization ratio would increase to 196 from 190  see also note 20 guarantees and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  foreign operations  the corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the us principally in europe norway denmark and france africa equatorial guinea libya algeria and ghana and asia and other malaysia thailand australia brunei the kurdistan region of iraq and china therefore the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk  see also item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  accounting policies  critical accounting policies and estimates  accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporations consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity  accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill  for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical    35    table of contents  audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporations total proved reserves  impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures  the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  the corporations impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly  the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation has concluded that within its eampp segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the segment manager accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units  the corporations fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar onshore and offshore peer companies the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in an impairment of goodwill  as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination  the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the    36    table of contents  deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporations internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values  retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporations financial statements  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings    37    table of contents derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example the corporation sold natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows    38    table of contents

takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities  the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities and although not currently significant superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party  the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2013 the corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 65 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporations remediation spending was approximately 16 million in 2013 and 19 million in both 2012 and 2011 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were approximately 100 million in 2013 70 million in 2012 and 95 million in 2011  forwardlooking information  certain sections of this annual report on form 10k including business and properties

environmental disclosures offbalance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies which include forwardlooking information these sections typically include statements with words such as anticipate estimate expect forecast guidance could may should would or similar words indicating that future outcomes are uncertain forwardlooking disclosures are based on the corporations current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions government actions and other factors for more information regarding the factors that may cause the corporations results to differ from these statements see item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow risk management activities are referred to as corporate risk management activities the corporation also has trading operations through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energyrelated commodities securities and derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed  in november 2013 the corporation completed the sale of its energy marketing business to direct energy a north american subsidiary of centrica plc centrica certain derivative contracts including new transactions following the closing date the delayed transfer derivative contracts have not been transferred to direct energy as required customer or regulatory consents have not been obtained however the agreement entered into between hess and direct energy on the closing date transfers all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business including the ownership of the    39    table of contents  delayed transfer derivative contracts to direct energy as a result the assets and liabilities related to the delayed transfer derivative contracts remain on the corporations consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 but changes in their fair value are offset based on the terms of the agreement between hess and direct energy the corporation therefore has no market risk related to these delayed transfer derivative contracts and only retains credit risk exposure which has been guaranteed by centrica it is expected that the transfer of these contracts will be substantially complete in the first half of 2014  controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporations senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporations risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipvs of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporations risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable  the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities  instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them            forward commodity contracts the corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities at settlement date the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures            forward foreign exchange contracts the corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the british pound and the thai baht which commit the corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date            exchange traded contracts the corporation uses exchange traded contracts including futures on a number of different underlying energy commodities these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits            swaps the corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract            options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods as a seller of options the corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option as a purchaser of options the corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities            energy securities energy securities include energyrelated equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities  corporate risk management activities  corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporations crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does    40    table of contents  business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating  the corporation has entered into brent crude oil fixed price swap contracts to hedge 25000 boepd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of 10912 per barrel the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain of approximately 4 million at december 31 2013  the corporations outstanding longterm debt of 5798 million including current maturities had a fair value of 6641 million at december 31 2013 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 160 million at december 31 2013 a 15 increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 150 million at december 31 2013  following is the value at risk for the corporations risk management commodity derivatives activities associated with continuing operations excluding foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives
