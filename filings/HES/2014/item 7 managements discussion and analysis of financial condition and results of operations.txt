  number of employees  the number of persons employed by the corporation at yearend was approximately 12225 in 2013 and 14775 in 2012 the reduction in the number of employees between 2013 and 2012 was largely a result of the corporations asset sales program of the employees remaining at yearend approximately 8800 in 2013 approximately 9500 in 2012 were employed in the corporations downstream

at its principal executive offices the corporation has also filed with the new york stock exchange nyse its annual certification that the corporations chief executive officer is unaware of any violation of the nyses corporate governance standards  item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future  our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility  if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be    13    table of contents  achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others  there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors  we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected  we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs we also transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and may result in heightened regulatory scrutiny that may lead to an increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely impact our operations  political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally for example production at the waha fields in libya which has a net production capacity of approximately 25000 boepd has been shutin since august 2013 and was also shutin for eight months in 2011 due to civil unrest the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry  our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general  concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporations exploration activities in france    14    table of contents concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns  our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs  catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable  cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations the loss or corruption of our data and proprietary information and communications interruptions in addition computers control oil and gas distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack impacting these distribution systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations  item 3 legal proceedings  the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved the corporation has reserves recorded which it believes are adequate to cover its expected liability in these cases    15    table of contents the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages  on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations  in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources the cercla claims have been dismissed and a trial is scheduled in june 2014 on the remaining claims hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint  the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation  item 4 mine safety disclosures  none    16    table of contents part ii      item 5 market for the registrants common stock related stockholder matters and
