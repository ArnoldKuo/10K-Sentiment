oil and natural gas prior to 2013 the corporation also operated a marketing and refining mampr segment which it began to divest during the year the mampr businesses manufacture refined petroleum products and purchase market store and trade refined products natural gas and electricity as well as operate retail gas stations most of which have convenience stores see also note 21 segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporations reportable segments at december 31 2013  in the first quarter of 2013 the corporation announced several initiatives to continue its transformation into a more focused pure play eampp company the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporations mampr businesses including its terminal retail energy marketing and energy trading operations as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading facility thus completing its exit from all refining operations hovensa llc hovensa a 5050 joint venture between the corporations subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp hovic and a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa had previously shut down its united

presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hess corporation and entities in which the corporation owns more than a 50 voting interest or entities that the corporation controls the corporation consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50 voting interest and over which it exercises control the corporations undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately consolidated investments in affiliated companies 20 to 50 owned and where the corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate are accounted for using the equity method  the 2012 and 2011 financial information has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the 2013 financial information which reflects the results of operations and cash flows of the corporations divested downstream businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 3 discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain other information in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the preparation of these financial statements the corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance  estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income actual results could differ from those estimates estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves asset and other valuations depreciable lives pension liabilities legal and environmental obligations asset retirement obligations and income taxes  revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to the customer sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the statement of consolidated income the corporation recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and the corporations share of natural gas production are not material  in its eampp activities the corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality similarly in its marketing activities the corporation enters into refined petroleum product purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of    52    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued     drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization the corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives retail gas stations and equipment related to leased properties are depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the net present value of future cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  impairment of goodwill the corporations goodwill is assigned to the eampp operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable this impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level which accounting standards define as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation determined its reporting units are its onshore and offshore businesses and tests for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount an impairment would be recorded  cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired    53    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for refined petroleum product inventories valued at cost the corporation uses principally the lastin firstout lifo inventory method for the remaining inventories cost is generally determined using average actual costs  income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method the corporation regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets the available carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in addition the corporation recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations the corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with longlived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets  retirement plans the corporation recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the corporation through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  fair value measurements the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by gaap these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill    54    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example the corporation entered into contracts to sell natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 there may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more liquid markets which are therefore classified as level 1 or level 2 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  sharebased compensation the fair value of all sharebased compensation is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards the corporation estimates the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using a blackscholes valuation model performance share units using a monte carlo simulation model and restricted stock based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant  foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency primary currency in which business is conducted for most foreign operations adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency into the functional currency are recorded in other net in the statement of consolidated income for operations that do not use the us dollar as the functional currency adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are recorded in a separate component of equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss  maintenance and repairs maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred capital improvements are recorded as additions in property plant and equipment  environmental expenditures the corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs on an undiscounted basis to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable the corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment    55    table of contents hess

is recognized in the corporations consolidated financial statements when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the risk of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible a liability is not accrued however the corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies  the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved the corporation has reserves recorded which it believes are adequate to cover its expected liability in these cases  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation      21 segment information  the corporation is transitioning to a pure play eampp company in

arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement the us bankruptcy code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty commonly known as the safe harbor provisions if a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterpartys bankruptcy these rights are generally enforceable with respect to safe harbor transactions if these arrangements provide the right of offset and the corporations intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination the corporations policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis  in the normal course of business the corporation relies on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as closeout netting including twoparty netting and single counterparty multilateral netting as applied to the corporation twoparty netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single hess entity and single counterparty multilateral netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple hess entities the corporation is reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the us in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the us bankruptcy code    79    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries

undeveloped reserves overall volumes of proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 28 million boe compared with yearend 2012 additions and revisions in proved undeveloped reserves from existing fields amounted to 123 million boe primarily in the united states these increases resulted from ongoing technical assessments performance evaluations and additional planned development activities in 2013 88 million boe were converted from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves resulting from continuing development activity and new wells principally in north dakota and the gulf of mexico in the us norway libya malaysia and equatorial guinea the corporation estimates that capital expenditures of 1765 million were incurred to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed

gas reserves  future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining yearend reserve estimates adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future development and production costs which are based on yearend costs and existing economic assumptions future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate yearend statutory tax rates to the pretax net cash flows relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10 the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile the prices which are required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows do not include the effects of hedges and may not be representative of future selling prices the future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used    92    table of contents                          at
