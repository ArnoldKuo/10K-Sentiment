discontinued operations   all downstream businesses were sold or shutdown as of december 31 2014 except for the energy trading joint venture hetco which was sold in february 2015 and hovensa which will be shut down in the first quarter of 2015   in the third quarter of 2014 the corporation sold its retail marketing business consisting of approximately 1350 retail gasoline stations most of which had convenience stores in addition the corporation sold in 2014 two joint venture investments in natural gas fueled electric generating projects in newark and bayonne new jersey   in the fourth quarter of 2013 the corporation sold its energy marketing and terminal network businesses which marketed refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity on the east coast of the us primarily to wholesale distributors industrial and commercial users and public utilities in the first quarter of 2013 the corporation permanently shut down refining operations at its port reading new jersey

hovensa and the government of the virgin islands agreed to a plan to pursue a sale of hovensa and the sales process commenced in the fourth quarter of 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2014 the government of the virgin islands did not approve a proposed operating agreement required to complete a proposed sale of hovensa see item 3 legal proceedings   competition and market conditions   see item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations for a discussion of competition and market conditions      11    other items   emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures   the corporation has in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities   responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporations plans the corporations contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented   to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for its global operations the corporation maintains membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis national response corporation nrc and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osrl are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support the corporation has contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl   the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes   insurance coverage and indemnification   the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages   the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporations property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 253 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance that provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to the corporations participating interest     12    the corporations insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable   generally the corporations drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis   the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount   under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severably liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several   environmental   compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general the corporation spent approximately 12 million in 2014 for environmental remediation principally relating to the downstream businesses the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporations capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   number of employees   the number of persons employed by the corporation was approximately 3045 at december 31 2014 and approximately 12225 at december 31 2013 of which approximately 8700 related to the retail business which was sold in 2014   other   the corporations internet address is wwwhesscom on its

our business and operations   our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future   our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets in the fourth quarter of 2014 prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil declined by approximately 40 to end the year at 57 per barrel and 53 per barrel respectively if crude oil prices remain at these levels for the remainder of 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2015 revenues and earnings from 2014 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation maintains significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility   if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves   there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic    14    business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected   we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny we own our own fleet of tank cars that exceed the current federal standards for construction and safety we expect that in 2015 the department of transportation will issue new standards for tank car design which may require us to retrofit our existing tank cars depending on the requirements of the regulation changes in tank car design and limitations on the availability of shop capacity to undertake retrofits as well as other possible regulations aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations    political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry   our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly the corporation has material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties   concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost   climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business    our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors    15    including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs   catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable   significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences the corporation is involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact information detailed in forwardlooking statements and may have material negative economic consequences   departures of key members from the corporations senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact the corporations ability to deliver its strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit the corporation from executing its strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value   the corporation is dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the exploration and production industry as a result the corporation may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact the ability of the corporation to run its operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences   cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations   16    item 3 legal proceedings   the corporation along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against the corporation have been settled in 2014 the corporation settled and paid claims against it arising out of an action brought by the state of new jersey for approximately 35 million the settlement was approved by the trial judge and the corporation paid the settlement amount in december 2014 in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that the corporation and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico also remained unresolved at december 31 2014 the corporation has recorded reserves for its estimated liabilities for its unresolved mtbe lawsuits   the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages   on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations   in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 hovensa was unable to make this additional payment because the usvirgin islands legislature did not approve a proposed operating agreement required to complete a proposed sale of hovensa which would have provided funds to make the settlement payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the us virgin islands government was granted a first lien on hovensas assets to secure the settlement payment and in january 2015 the government commenced a foreclosure action to enforce this lien hovensa intends to defend this action and may take other steps in response to the action including the sale of assets andor the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition   in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan hovensa had been in negotiations with the pbgc to make additional contributions to the plan    17    with proceeds from a proposed sale of hovensa which was not completed for the reasons described above the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition   the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material   the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation   item 4 mine safety disclosures   none         18    part ii    item 5 market for the

and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pretax amounts     26    comparison of

and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013 a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play higher production resulting from an active drilling program in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was comparable in 2013 and 2012 as higher production from the bakken oil shale play was partly offset by natural decline and maintenance in the other us assets   europe crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the april 2013 sale of the corporations russian subsidiary partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the vahall field in norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013 higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field crude oil and natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to asset sales the bittern and schiehallion fields in the uk north sea which were sold in the second half of 2012 were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 12000 boepd at the time of sale the beryl fields also in the uk north sea which were producing at an aggregate net rate of approximately 10000 boepd at the time of sale were sold in the first quarter of 2013 and the corporations russian subsidiary which was producing approximately 50000 boepd at the time of sale was sold in april 2013     29    africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 and from 2013 to 2012 primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013 following civil unrest in the country in december 2014 the libyan national oil company declared force majeure with respect to the waha fields and production is currently shutin the decline from 2013 compared to 2012 was also due to lower production from the okume complex in offshore equatorial guinea which was partially offset by new production from the ceiba field   asia and other crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 largely as a result of the divestiture of the corporations interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and the corporations interest in the azerichiragguneshli acg fields azerbaijan in march 2013 natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the corporations divestiture of its interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014 and lower production from the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda which was partially offset by a full year of production from the north malay basin crude oil production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to the sale in march 2013 of the corporations interest in the acg fields natural gas production was lower in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower production entitlement at the jda together with lower production at the pangkah field in

natural gas liquids and natural gas from the corporations partners in hess operated wells or other third parties cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes

higher volumes of crude oil purchases from third parties   cash operating costs cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 330 million in 2014 compared with 2013 and decreased by approximately 200 million in 2013 compared with 2012 the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and the corporations interests in russia in april 2013 as well as lower employee costs the decrease in 2013 was due to lower production taxes following the sale of the corporations russian operations and reductions in transportation costs lease operating expenses

and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by approximately 540 million in 2014 and decreased by 182 million in 2013 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior

libya   exploration expenses exploration expenses excluding items affecting comparability of earnings were lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense geologic

41 in 2014 43 in 2013 and 45 in 2012 the decline in the effective income tax rate in 2014 compared with 2013 and in 2013 compared with 2012 was primarily due to the impact of shutin production in libya from the third quarter of 2013 based on current strip crude oil prices we are forecasting a pretax loss for 2015 and as a result the eampp effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 38 to 42 excluding libyan operations   items affecting comparability of earnings between periods reported eampp earnings included the

into a new 4 billion fiveyear credit agreement with a maturity date of january 2020 this facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit borrowings on the new facility bear interest at 1075 above the london interbank offered rate a fee of 0175 per annum is also payable on the amount of the facility the interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the corporations credit rating changes   the corporations longterm debt agreements including the revolving credit facility contain financial covenants that restrict the amount of total borrowings and secured debt the most restrictive of these covenants allow the corporation to borrow up to an additional 56 billion of secured debt at december 31 2014   the corporation also has a shelf registration under which it may issue additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock promptly after filing this annual report on form 10k as a result of the corporations existing shelf registration statement expiring on february 27 2015 the corporation anticipates filing a new shelf registration statement under the securities act of 1933 as amended under which it may issue among other things additional debt securities warrants common stock or preferred stock credit ratings   there are three major credit rating agencies that rate the corporations debt all three agencies have currently assigned an investment grade rating with a stable outlook to the corporations debt the interest rates and facility fees charged on some of the corporations credit facilities as well as margin requirements from financial risk management counterparties are subject to adjustment if the corporations credit rating changes   37     contractual obligations and contingencies the following table shows aggregate

contractually committed at december 31 2014 including the portion of the corporations planned capital expenditure program for 2015 obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses seismic purchases and other normal business expenses other longterm liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2014 including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions   the corporation and certain of its subsidiaries lease drilling rigs tankers office space and other assets for varying periods under leases accounted for as operating leases   the corporation is contingently liable under 54 million of letters of credit at december 31 2014 offbalance sheet arrangements   the corporation had leveraged leases associated with certain retail gasoline stations which were not included in its consolidated balance sheet and had a fair value of approximately 238 million at december 31 2013 if these leases were included as debt the corporations december 31 2013 debt to capitalization ratio would have increased to 196 from 190 the leases were terminated in 2014 in conjunction with the anticipated divestiture of retail marketing that closed in september 2014   see also note 18 guarantees and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements foreign operations   the corporation conducts exploration and production activities outside the us principally in europe norway and denmark africa equatorial guinea libya algeria and ghana and asia and other joint development area of malaysiathailand malaysia australia the kurdistan region of iraq china guyana and canada therefore the corporation is subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk corruption acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk   see also item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations     38    accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates   accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporations consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity   accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred   the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors   crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill   for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporations total proved reserves each year   proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period before december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices remained at significantly higher levels during the first ten months of 2014 and declined during the last two months of the year as a result the average crude oil price used to calculate proved reserves at december 31 2014 is significantly higher than the yearend 2014 crude oil price the yearend 2015 reserve estimates will be based on the same unweighted arithmetic average formula using firstdayofthemonth prices for 2015 and will reflect the current low crude oil price environment from the beginning of the year if current strip crude oil prices hold through 2015 proved reserves at december 31 2015 could be significantly lower than proved reserves at december 31 2014 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any net negative change in proved reserves that may result from lower crude oil prices due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2015 crude oil prices any revisions in proved reserves that may occur based on 2015 reservoir performance the levels to which industry costs will decline in response to lower prices and managements plans as of december 31 2015 for developing proved undeveloped reserves through the year 2020 which will be the fiveyear window for recognizing proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2015 despite the uncertainties cited based on facts and assumptions existing at december 31 2014 if brent crude oil prices were to average 60 per barrel in 2015 the corporation estimates that 2015 depreciation depletion and amortization expenses would increase by not more than 75 million aftertax as a result of changes in proved reserves compared with december 31 2014 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 87 through 95 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the corporations oil and gas reserves   39      impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements   in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices    the corporations impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 the corporation tested its oil and gas properties for impairment and determined no impairment existed at december 31 2014   impairment of goodwill the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation concluded that within its eampp segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the operating segment manager   in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the corporation performs step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded   the corporations fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of the corporations market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values    significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value or one or more assets of the reporting unit having taxable temporary differences that result in recognition of goodwill for the reporting unit under purchase accounting requirements in a business combination   40      as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset   crude oil prices declined significantly following the date of the corporations annual goodwill impairment test on october 1 2014 in addition the corporations stock price decreased to a level at december 31 2014 that resulted in the corporations book value exceeding its market capitalization by 6 as a result of these potential indicators of impairment the corporation performed a separate goodwill impairment test at december 31 2014 the offshore and onshore reporting units which have allocated goodwill of 1098 million and 760 million respectively at december 31 2014 each passed step one of the impairment test however the onshore reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying value by 5 while not required the corporation performed a hypothetical step two test for the onshore reporting unit and estimated that the implied fair value of goodwill exceeded its carrying value accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of its goodwill totaling 1858 million will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units based on market conditions at december 31 2014   income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination   the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation considers the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporations internal business forecasts the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations   asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values   retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans   the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations    41    while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporations financial statements   derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both financial risk management and trading activities in financial risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions the energy trading joint venture hetco was sold in the first quarter of 2015   all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings   derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices   fair value measurements the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities   the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill   the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2   when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy   details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows   fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity   42      fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts   fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 environment health and safety the corporations long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business

in the shortterm increase the corporations operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets reputation and license to operate in addition to enhanced ehs amp sr performance improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in ehs amp sr the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance audit facilities train employees prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs amp sr goals and objectives   the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation assesses monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities   the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which the corporation retained liability and although not currently significant superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party   the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2014 the corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporations remediation spending was approximately 12 million in 2014 16 million in 2013 and 19 million in 2012 the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporations capital expenditures and operating expenses    forwardlooking information   certain sections of this annual report on form 10k including business and

financial statements the corporation is exposed in the normal course of its business to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow financial risk management activities refer to the mitigation of these risks through hedging activities the corporation is also exposed to commodity price risks primarily related to crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as foreign currency values from its 50 voting interest in a consolidated energy trading joint venture hetco which was sold in the first quarter of 2015   in conjunction with the corporations sale of its energy marketing business in the fourth quarter of 2013 certain derivative contracts including new transactions following the closing date the delayed transfer derivative contracts were not transferred to the acquirer direct energy a north american subsidiary of centrica plc centrica as required customer or regulatory consents had not been obtained however the agreement entered into between hess and direct energy on the closing date transferred all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business including the ownership of the delayed transfer derivative contracts to direct energy the transfer of these remaining contracts was completed during the third quarter of 2014   controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporations senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporations financial risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipvs of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporations financial risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading joint venture the corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable   value at risk the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its financial risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in financial risk management activities   instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its financial risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them         forward commodity contracts the corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities at settlement date the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures       forward foreign exchange contracts the corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the british pound and danish krone which commit the corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date       exchange traded contracts the corporation uses exchange traded contracts including futures on a number of different underlying energy commodities these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits       swaps the corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its financial risk management and trading activities cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract       options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods as a seller of options the corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option as a purchaser of options the corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities       energy securities energy securities include energyrelated equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities   44    financial risk management activities   financial risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporations crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating   the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 weakening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a loss of approximately 120 million at december 31 2014   the corporations outstanding longterm debt of 5987 million including current maturities had a fair value of 7003 million at december 31 2014 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 485 million at december 31 2014 a 15 increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 430 million at

which it exercises control the corporations undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately consolidated investments in affiliated companies 20 to 50 owned and where the corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate are accounted for using the equity method  the prior years financial information has been recast to reflect consolidated results of operations cash flows and other information of the corporations divested consolidated downstream businesses the port reading refining facility and hetco as discontinued operations see also note 2 discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain other information in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation  estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income actual results could differ from those estimates estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves asset and other valuations depreciable lives pension liabilities legal and environmental obligations asset retirement obligations and income taxes  revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas when title passes to the customer the corporation recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and the corporations entitlement share of natural gas production are not material sales of refined petroleum products and other merchandise from divested downstream operations were also recognized when title passed to customers  in its eampp activities the corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales    56    contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization the corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices as a result of the significant decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 the corporation tested its oil and gas properties for impairment and determined no impairment existed at december 31 2014 impairment of goodwill the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation concluded that within its eampp segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the corporation performs step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded the corporation performed a separate goodwill impairment test at december 31 2014 and determined no impairment existed cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is generally determined using average actual costs at december 31 2013 refined petroleum product inventories associated with the now divested downstream businesses were valued at cost using principally the lastin firstout lifo inventory method  income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation considers the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors in addition the corporation recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations the corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense   57    asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with longlived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets retirement plans the corporation recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both financial risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation may use futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the corporation through a consolidated joint venture which is classified as heldforsale at december 31 2014 trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows

generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs

contingently liable in addition the corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to various lawsuits claims and other proceedings including environmental matters a liability is recognized in the corporations consolidated financial statements when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if the risk of loss is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or the risk of loss is only reasonably possible a liability is not accrued however the corporation discloses the nature of those contingencies  in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 hovensa was unable to make this additional payment because the usvirgin islands legislature did not approve a proposed operating agreement required to complete a proposed sale of hovensa which would have provided funds to make the settlement payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the us virgin islands government was granted a first lien on hovensas assets to secure the settlement payment and in january 2015 the government commenced a foreclosure action to enforce this lien hovensa intends to defend this action and may take other steps in response to the action including the sale of assets andor the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan hovensa had been in negotiations with the pbgc to make additional contributions to the plan with proceeds from a proposed sale of hovensa which was not completed for the reasons described above the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition the corporation along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities    75    or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against the corporation have been settled in march 2014 the corporation agreed to settle claims against it arising out of an action brought by the state of new jersey for approximately 35 million the settlement was approved by the trial judge and the corporation paid the settlement amount in december 2014 in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that the corporation and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico also remained unresolved at december 31 2014 the corporation has recorded reserves for its estimated liabilities for its unresolved mtbe lawsuits the corporation is subject to loss contingencies with respect to various claims lawsuits and other proceedings the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such claims lawsuits and proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be numerous issues may need to be resolved including through lengthy discovery conciliation andor arbitration proceedings or litigation before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such lawsuits claims and proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation however the corporation could incur judgments enter into settlements or revise its opinion regarding the outcome of certain matters and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid        76    19 segment information  the corporation has substantially completed its transition to a pure

credit risk master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement the us bankruptcy code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty commonly known as the safe harbor provisions if a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterpartys bankruptcy these rights are generally enforceable with respect to safe harbor transactions if these arrangements provide the right of offset and the corporations intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination the corporations policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis  in the normal course of business the corporation relies on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as closeout netting including twoparty netting and single counterparty multilateral netting as applied to the corporation twoparty netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single hess entity and single counterparty multilateral netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple hess entities the corporation is reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the us in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the us bankruptcy code    80    the following table provides information about the effect of netting arrangements on the presentation of the

exchange commission sec regulations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board proved oil and gas reserves are quantities which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations the corporations estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by internal teams of geoscience professionals and reservoir engineers estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic petroleum engineering and evaluation principals and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the society of petroleum engineers entitled standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information revision as of february 19 2007 the method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate the stage of reservoir development and the production history where applicable reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation as defined in the sec regulations these technologies including computational methods must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in order for reserves to be classified as proved any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project either senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the development the corporations proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are discussed in item 1a risk factors related to our business and

dampm to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 80 of 2014 yearend reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 82 in 2013 the purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with sec regulations the dampm letter report dated february 4 2015 on the corporations estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry dampm is an independent petroleum

in 2012  proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period before december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices remained at significantly higher levels during the first ten months of 2014 and declined during the last two months of the year as a result the average crude oil price used to calculate proved reserves at december 31 2014 is significantly higher than the yearend 2014 crude oil price the yearend 2015 reserve estimates will be based on the same unweighted arithmetic average formula using firstdayofthemonth prices for 2015 and will reflect the current low crude oil price environment from the beginning of the year if current strip crude oil prices hold through 2015 proved reserves at december 31 2015 could be significantly lower than proved reserves at december 31 2014 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative change in proved reserves that may result from lower crude oil prices as of december 31 2015 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2015 crude oil prices any revisions in proved reserves based on 2015 reservoir performance the levels to which industry costs will decline in response to lower prices and managements plans as of december 31 2015 for developing proved undeveloped reserves through the year 2020 which will be the fiveyear window for recognizing proved undeveloped reserves as of december 31 2015 in 2014 proved reserve additions in the united states were 115 million barrels of crude oil 22 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 184 million mcf of

47 million boe consisting of 40 million barrels of crude oil and 7 million barrels of natural gas liquids as a result of well performance and reprioritization of well locations in the drilling schedule resulting in certain wells moving beyond 2019 transfers from proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves amounted to 38 million boe consisting of 31 million barrels of crude oil 5 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 15 million mcf of natural gas       in the utica wet gas play in ohio the corporation added 18 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves consisting of

transfers in proved undeveloped reserves amounted to a net decrease of 3 million boe additions of 21 million boe consisting of 20 million barrels of crude oil and 9 million mcf of natural gas relate to the sanction of the stampede project in addition reserve revisions of 6 million boe from the conger field increased yearend proved undeveloped reserves primarily as a result of first production at the tubular bells field 30 million boe consisting of 21 million barrels of crude oil 3 million barrels of natural gas liquids and 35 million mcf of natural gas were transferred from proved undeveloped

phase of the project       total other transfers of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves of 26 million boe were from denmark the jda and other assets the corporation estimates that capital expenditures totaling 3110 million were incurred to convert 110 million boe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves during 2014 the capital expenditures include production facilities and subsea infrastructure for the tubular bells field in the gulf of mexico which achieved first production in late 2014  the december 31 2013 oil and gas reserve estimates disclosed above include 502 million barrels of liquid hydrocarbons and 865 million mcf of natural gas or an aggregate of 646 million boe classified as proved undeveloped reserves overall volumes of proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 28 million boe compared with yearend 2012 in 2013 additions and revisions to proved undeveloped reserves amounted to 123 million boe primarily in the united states the additions and revisions primarily resulted from ongoing technical assessments performance evaluations and additional planned development activities in 2013 transfers to proved developed reserves amounted to 88

million barrels in 2013 and 5 million barrels in 2012  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves  future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining yearend reserve estimates adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future development and production costs which are based on yearend costs and existing economic assumptions future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate yearend statutory tax rates to the pretax net cash flows as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10 the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile the prices required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows are on the same basis for determining proved oil and gas reserves and do not include the effects of commodity hedges as a result selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices in addition the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses the amount of tax deductions credits and allowances relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves variances in actual pretax cash flows from forecasted pretax cash flows in historical periods and the impact to yearend carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the corporations income tax returns exploration expenses interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations the future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves at december 31 2012 and january 1 2012 have been restated to include excess carryforward deductions relating to proved oil and gas reserves in the computation of future income tax expenses at each date to be
