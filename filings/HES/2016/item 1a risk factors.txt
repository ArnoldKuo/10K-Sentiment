denmark equatorial guinea the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda malaysia and norway the bakken midstream operating segment which was established in the second quarter of 2015 provides feebased services including crude oil and natural gas gathering processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids transportation of crude oil by rail car terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids and the storage and terminaling of propane primarily in the bakken shale play of north dakota in july 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hess infrastructure partners lp hip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion hip and its affiliates primarily comprise the bakken midstream operating segment in 2013 we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play eampp company these initiatives represented the culmination of a multiyear strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities and execute a smaller more targeted exploration program this transformation was completed in 2015 during 2013 through 2015 the corporation sold mature or lower margin eampp assets in algeria azerbaijan indonesia russia thailand the united kingdom uk north sea and certain interests onshore in the us in addition the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporations marketing and refining mampr business including its

determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2015 were 5510 per barrel for brent 2014 10135 and 5013 per barrel for wti 2014 9442 negative reserve revisions resulting from lower crude oil prices in 2015 reduced proved reserves at december 31 2015 by 234 million barrels of oil equivalent boe and represent the primary reason for the decrease in total proved reserves yearonyear these negative revisions represent primarily proved undeveloped reserves that were not economically producible at the stipulated lower prices our total proved developed and

receive approval on the remaining two appraisal plans in 2014 we drilled three successful appraisal wells well results continue to be evaluated and development planning is progressing the government of côte divoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of ghana which includes a portion of our deepwater tanocape three points license we are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter which may also impact our ability to develop the license the international tribunal for law of the sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017 under terms of our license the deadline to declare commerciality for the pecan field which would be the primary development hub for the block is in march 2016 and the deadline to submit a plan of development is in september 2016 we have requested an extension of the submission deadline for a plan of development for the pecan field and will continue to work

production system we expect net production to increase from approximately 40 million cubic feet per day in 2016 to approximately 165 million cubic feet per day following the completion of full field development in 2017  australia at the wa390p block hess 100 in the carnarvon basin offshore western australia also known as equus covering approximately 780000 acres we have drilled 13 natural gas discoveries in late 2014 we executed a nonbinding letter of intent with a potential liquefaction partner and began joint frontend engineering studies in 2015 discussions with potential longterm purchasers of liquefied natural gas were also initiated in 2015 successful negotiation of a binding agreement with the thirdparty liquefaction partner is necessary before we can execute a gas sales agreement and sanction development of the project at our adjacent wa474p block hess 100 which could become part of the equus project we plan to drill a commitment well in 2016 see capitalized

quantities of our natural gas and natural gas liquids production the natural gas contracts principally relate to producing fields in asia the most significant of these net commitments relates to the jda where the minimum contract quantity of natural gas is estimated at 48 billion cubic feet per year based on current entitlements under a sales contract with the national oil companies of malaysia and thailand expiring in 2027 at the north malay basin development project we have a commitment to deliver a minimum of 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year through 2033 from full field development startup which is expected in 2017 the companys estimated total volume of production subject to sales commitments is approximately 08 trillion cubic feet of natural gas we also have natural gas liquids delivery commitments in the bakken and permian basin of texas through 2023 of approximately 9 million barrels per year or approximately 97 million barrels over the life of the contracts we have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments and we anticipate being able to meet future requirements from available proved

negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 289 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault    12    variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several environmental compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 13 million in 2015 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations number of employees at december 31 2015 we had 2770 employees

any violation of the nyses corporate governance standards    13      item 1a risk factors  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally at december 31 2015 spot prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil closed at 3661 per barrel and 3713 per barrel respectively average prices for 2015 were 5364 per barrel for brent and 4880 per barrel for wti if crude oil prices in 2016 remain at levels consistent with or below yearend 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2016 revenues and operating results from 2015 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 resulting in a significant reduction to our proved reserves as of december 31 2015 if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further it could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the    14    value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our eampp operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny in the wake of these accidents several us government agencies have issued safety advisories or emergency orders requiring rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures when shipping crude oil by rail in 2015 the department of transportation issued new standards for tank car design which could require hip to retrofit or upgrade its existing fleet of tank cars the requirements of these new regulatory actions as well as other possible regulations or voluntary measures by the rail industry aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2015 we had a net loss attributable to hess corporation of 3056 million and if commodity prices remain low through 2016 we are forecasting a net loss for 2016 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in january 2016 fitch ratings fitch affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative in february 2016 standard and poors ratings services sampp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moodys investors service moodys lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new    15    regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the eampp industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences we manage commodity price risk through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases in addition as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry    16    may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addition as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks
