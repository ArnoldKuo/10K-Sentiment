unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions crude oil prices used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2015 were 5510 per barrel for brent 2014 10135 and 5013 per barrel for wti 2014 9442 negative reserve revisions resulting from lower crude oil prices in 2015 reduced proved reserves at december 31 2015 by 234 million barrels of oil equivalent boe and represent the primary reason for the decrease in total proved reserves yearonyear

preparedness and response plans and procedures we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl we continue to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes insurance coverage and indemnification we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 289 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault    12    variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several environmental compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 13 million in 2015 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental

any violation of the nyses corporate governance standards    13      item 1a risk factors  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally at december 31 2015 spot prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil closed at 3661 per barrel and 3713 per barrel respectively average prices for 2015 were 5364 per barrel for brent and 4880 per barrel for wti if crude oil prices in 2016 remain at levels consistent with or below yearend 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2016 revenues and operating results from 2015 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 resulting in a significant reduction to our proved reserves as of december 31 2015 if crude oil prices remain at current levels or decline further it could have a material adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the    14    value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our eampp operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny in the wake of these accidents several us government agencies have issued safety advisories or emergency orders requiring rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures when shipping crude oil by rail in 2015 the department of transportation issued new standards for tank car design which could require hip to retrofit or upgrade its existing fleet of tank cars the requirements of these new regulatory actions as well as other possible regulations or voluntary measures by the rail industry aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2015 we had a net loss attributable to hess corporation of 3056 million and if commodity prices remain low through 2016 we are forecasting a net loss for 2016 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in january 2016 fitch ratings fitch affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative in february 2016 standard and poors ratings services sampp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moodys investors service moodys lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new    15    regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the eampp industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences we manage commodity price risk through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases in addition as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry    16    may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addition as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks item 1b unresolved staff comments none item 3 legal proceedings we along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy courts confirmation of hovensas liquidation plan which is described below we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river to that end in april 2014 epa issued a focused feasibility study ffs proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion epa may issue a record of decision rod in 2016 selecting a remedy for the lower eight miles based on the ffs but the ultimate remedy and associated cost for the lower passaic river remains uncertain at this stage the rod is unlikely to address an additional nine miles of the passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies and the fact that epa has not yet selected a remedy for part or all of the lower passaic river remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the    17    final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed in may 2005 the government of the us virgin islands filed a complaint in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa llc hovensa a 5050 joint venture between our subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp hovic and a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 on september 15 2015 hovensa filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the bankruptcy code in the united states district court of the virgin islands  bankruptcy division the bankruptcy court and commenced a courtsupervised sale of substantially all of its assets pursuant to section 363 of the bankruptcy code to fund hovensas sale process and orderly winddown hovensa entered into a 40 million debtorinpossession credit facility with hovensas owners the terms of which were approved by the bankruptcy court on december 1 2015 the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the sale of hovensas terminal and refinery assets to limetree bay terminals llc limetree the senate of the us virgin islands approved the sale in december 2015 and the sale to limetree was completed on january 4 2016 the 40 million claim held by the us virgin islands government against hovensa on account of the 2014 settlement agreement was also paid from the sale proceeds on january 19 2016 the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming hovensas chapter 11 plan of liquidation the liquidation plan under the liquidation plan which became effective february 17 2016 hovensa established a liquidating trust to distribute certain assets and sale proceeds to its creditors established an environmental response trust to administer to hovensas remaining environmental obligations and will conduct an orderly winddown of its remaining activities the liquidation plan also provides for releases of any claims held by hovensa and its bankruptcy estate against us and hovic and releases any claims held by certain thirdparty creditors of hovensa against us and hovic both effective upon the effective date of the liquidation plan in connection with the liquidation plan and hovensas asset sale hovic relinquished its claims against hovensa on account of promissory notes issued by hovensa to hovic on september 13 2015 the government of the us virgin islands filed a complaint against us in the territorial superior court of the virgin islands division of st croix alleging among other things that we violated territorial statutes and committed various torts in connection with the 50 ownership interest of our subsidiary hovic in hovensa in connection with the closing of hovensas asset sale to limetree we the government of the us virgin islands hovic hovensa and pdvsa entered into a mutual release agreement that resulted in the dismissal with prejudice of all pending litigation among those parties including the lawsuit filed by the government of the us virgin islands against us and various tax refund lawsuits filed by hovic and pdvsa against the government of the us virgin islands as part of this agreement the government of the us virgin islands also granted us hovic and hovensa a general release of all other existing claims with the exception of claims related to environmental matters which were automatically released upon the establishment of the environmental response trust in connection with the liquidation plan on december 18 2014 the epa initiated an administrative complaint against hovensa for alleged violations of the clean air acts risk management program requirements at the st croix facility in connection with the liquidation plan hovensa has agreed to settle the epas allegations with the payment of a civil penalty of 115000 in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan in connection with the hovensas sale to limetree and the liquidation plan the corporation assumed the hovensa pension plan upon the effective date of the liquidation plan and the pbgc withdrew its notice of determination in 2015 we recorded a charge of 30 million primarily representing the estimated net difference between the hovensa pension plan obligation and fair value of the plan assets on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 we expect that any penalties arising from this matter will be covered by the liquidating trust established under the liquidation plan  we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epas claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these    18    proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material we are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the

development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark equatorial guinea the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda malaysia and norway the bakken midstream operating segment which was established in the second quarter of 2015 provides feebased services including crude oil and natural gas gathering processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids transportation of crude oil by rail car terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids and the storage and terminaling of propane primarily in the bakken shale play of north dakota transformation to a pure play eampp company in 2013 we announced several initiatives to continue our transformation from an integrated energy company into a more geographically focused pure play eampp company these initiatives represented the culmination of a multiyear strategic transformation designed to leverage our lean manufacturing capabilities across unconventional assets exploit our deepwater drilling and project development capabilities and execute a smaller more targeted exploration program this transformation was completed in 2015 during 2013 through 2015 the corporation sold mature or lower margin eampp assets in algeria azerbaijan indonesia russia thailand the united kingdom uk north sea and certain interests onshore in the us in addition the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporations marketing and refining mampr business including its terminal retail energy marketing and energy trading operations as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading nj facility hovensa llc hovensa a 5050 joint venture between the corporations subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp hovic and petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa had previously shut down its us virgin islands refinery in 2012 hovensa filed a voluntary petition

purchased the terminal and refinery assets of the st croix facility and hovensa will conduct an orderly winddown of its remaining activities see item 3 legal proceedings response to low oil prices in 2015 we realized an adjusted net loss of 1113 million and incurred a net operating cash flow deficit cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities of 2225 million based on average 2015 west texas intermediate wti oil prices of 4880 per barrel brent  5364 per barrel in response to the decline in crude oil prices that began in late 2014 we conducted an extensive companywide review of our cost base and engaged with our suppliers to identify opportunities to reduce costs during 2015 as a result of these cost reduction efforts we decreased eampp capital and exploratory expenditures by 400 million to 40 billion and cash operating costs by approximately 300 million versus our 2015 plan at december 31 2015 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 74 billion oil and gas production in 2016 is forecast to be in the range of 330000 to 350000 barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd compared with 375000 boepd in 2015 and we have reduced our 2016 eampp capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately 24 billion down 40 from 2015 capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately 340 million in 2016 forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015 and as a result we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2016 in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock par value 1 per share with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share of convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of approximately 16 billion we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities andor pursuing further asset sales see note 23 subsequent events in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  consolidated results net loss was 3056 million in 2015 compared with net income in the prior two years 2014 2317 million 2013 5052 million excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 28 adjusted net loss was 1113 million in 2015    24    compared with adjusted net income in the

excluding any contribution from libya total proved reserves were 1086 million barrels of oil equivalent boe 1431 million boe and 1437 million boe at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at december 31 2015 primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves significant 2015 activities the following is an update of significant eampp activities for 2015 producing eampp assets          in north dakota net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 112000 boepd 2014 83000 boepd with the increase from prioryear primarily due to ongoing field development during 2015 we operated an average of 85 rigs drilled 182 wells completed 212 wells and brought on production 219 wells bringing the total operated production wells to 1201 at december 31 2015 drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged 58 million in 2015 down 21 from 2014 in 2016 we plan to operate an average of two rigs to drill approximately 50 wells and bring approximately 80 wells on production while reducing capital expenditures to 425 million down from 13 billion in 2015 bakken production is forecast to average between 95000 boepd and 105000 boepd in 2016          at the valhall field in norway net production averaged 33000 boepd 2014 31000 boepd with the increase from prioryear primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells in the current period during 2015 the operator bp drilled one well and completed three wells and continued to execute a multiyear well abandonment program production from the valhall field is forecast to average approximately 30000 boepd in 2016 with the decrease from 2015 reflecting reduced drilling activity          at block a18 of the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda the operator carigali hess operating company continued drilling production wells and progressed its booster compression project that is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2016 production averaged 42000 boepd 2014 42000 boepd including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia production from the jda is forecast to average approximately 35000 boepd in 2016 due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with the booster compression project          at the hess operated tubular bells field we achieved our first full year of production following first oil in late 2014 in the second half of 2015 a subsurface safety valve stuck in the closed position at one well and two other wells experienced wellbore skin effects that reduced production rates as a result fullyear 2015 production from tubular bells was restricted to 19000 boepd and we estimate fullyear 2016 net production to be approximately 20000 boepd to 25000 boepd in 2016 we intend to complete one water injector well drill one production well perform two wellbore stimulations and complete a workover on a third well to open the stuck subsurface safety valve          in the north malay basin nmb in 2015 net production from the early production system averaged approximately 40 million cubic feet per day 2014 43 million cubic feet per day in 2015 we also progressed fabrication and installation of the central processing platform and commenced development drilling activities associated with the fullfield development project this project is on schedule to be completed in 2017 from which production is forecast to average approximately 165 million cubic feet per day          at the south arne field offshore denmark we continued drilling operations in 2015 and expect to complete drilling of a previously sanctioned eleven well multiyear program in the first quarter of 2016 net production is forecast to average approximately between 10000 boepd and 15000 boepd in 2016 compared with 13000 boepd in 2015          in the utica shale 24 wells were drilled 32 wells were completed and 32 wells were brought into production in 2015 net production increased to approximately 24000 boepd in 2015 in the third quarter of 2015 we completed the sale of approximately 13000 acres of utica dry gas acreage for consideration of approximately 120 million in 2016 we and our joint venture partner plan to suspend drilling activities but will bring into production 14 wells net production is expected to average between 20000 boepd and 25000 boepd in 2016          in equatorial guinea we deferred the remaining portion of an infill drilling program at the okume field to reduce spend and allow time to evaluate recently acquired 4d seismic net production in 2016 is expected to average between 30000 boepd and 35000 boepd compared with net production in 2015 of 43000 boepd          in algeria production averaged 10000 boepd for the fourth quarter of 2015 we sold our interests

field targeted in 2018 at an expected net rate of 15000 boepd          in ghana we along with our coowners continued development planning and subsurface evaluation in 2015 the government of côte divoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of ghana which includes a portion of our deepwater tanocape three points license we are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter which may also impact our ability to develop the license the international tribunal for law of the sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017 under terms of our license the deadline to declare commerciality for the pecan field which would be the primary development hub for the block is in march 2016 and the deadline to submit a plan of development is in september 2016 we have requested an extension of the submission deadline for a plan of development for the pecan field and will continue to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute in 2015 we expensed previously capitalized gas wells that have not sufficiently progressed appraisal negotiations with the regulator see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 5 property plant and equipment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements          at the equus project on block wa390p in

management reviews segment earnings on an aftertax basis and uses aftertax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings management believes that aftertax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pretax amount aftertax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax

to 2015 2014 and 2013 can be summarized as follows united states onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field which came online in november 2014 was offset primarily by lower production from the llano conger and shenzi fields crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production was higher in 2014 compared with 2013 a result of continued development of the bakken oil shale play higher production resulting from drilling in the utica shale and a new production well combined with lower downtime at the llano field in the gulf of mexico europe crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in the current year crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the april 2013 sale of our russian subsidiary partially offset by higher production during 2014 at the    31    valhall field in norway following completion of the redevelopment project in 2013 higher natural gas production in 2014 compared to 2013 was a result of higher uptime from the valhall field africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to libyan production being shutin crude oil production in africa was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to the shutdown of the es sider terminal in libya in the third quarter of 2013 following civil unrest in the country net production averaged 4000 barrels of oil per day bopd in 2014 and 13000 bopd in 2013 in december 2014 the national oil company of libya declared force majeure with respect to the waha concession and production is currently shutin asia and other natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the joint development area of malaysiathailand jda as a result of higher facility uptime crude oil production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of the divestiture of our interests in the pangkah field in indonesia in january 2014 and our interest in the azerichiragguneshli acg fields azerbaijan in march 2013 natural gas production was lower in 2014 compared to 2013 following the divestiture of our remaining interests in indonesia and thailand in 2014

cost of products sold is mainly comprised of costs relating to the purchases of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas from our partners in hess operated wells or other thirdparties as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment starting in 2014 the decrease in cost of products sold in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices cost of products sold in 2014 was comparable to 2013 as a result of increased volumes purchased from partners in our operated wells being offset by lower purchases from thirdparties cash operating costs cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and eampp general and administrative expenses decreased by 188 million in 2015 compared with the prior year 2014 315 million decrease versus 2013 the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014 the decrease in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily reflects lower production taxes and operating costs following the divestitures of our remaining indonesia and thailand assets in early 2014 and our interests in russia in april 2013 as well as lower employee costs bakken midstream tariffs tariffs for 2015 primarily reflect higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project the tariff arrangements were not in place prior to 2014 depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa costs increased by 712 million in 2015 from 2014 primarily reflecting higher production volumes from the bakken tubular bells and utica fields which had higher ddampa rates per barrel than the portfolio average higher production in 2014 from these fields as well as the valhall field and north malay basin were the primarily drivers for the increase in ddampa costs in 2014 compared to 2013   32    unit costs unit cost per boe information is based

comparability of earnings described below were lower in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower leasehold impairment expense geologic and seismic costs and employee expenses for 2016 we estimate exploration expenses excluding dry hole expense to be in the range of 260 million to 280 million income taxes excluding the impact of items affecting comparability of earnings between periods provided below the effective income tax rates for eampp operations amounted to a benefit of 46 in 2015 2014 41 charge 2013 42 charge the tax benefit in 2015 resulted from operating losses while the increased effective rate from 2014 is due to a greater proportion of results attributable to higher tax jurisdictions the decline in the effective tax rate from 2014 compared with 2013 was primarily due to the impact of shutin production in libya from the third quarter of 2013 based on current strip crude oil prices we are forecasting a pretax loss for 2016 and as a result the eampp effective tax rate excluding items affecting comparability is expected to be a benefit in the range of 41 to 45 excluding libyan operations items affecting comparability of earnings

investing activities the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2015 as compared to 2014 is primarily due to reduced drilling activity the bakken the utica norway and equatorial guinea reduced development expenditures at tubular bells and the jda and lower exploratory drilling activity ghana and kurdistan these reductions were offset by 2015 activity related to development activities at stampede in the gulf of mexico and exploration drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and guyana and full field development at north malay basin the decrease in additions to property plant and equipment in 2014 as compared with 2013 is largely due to the ongoing reduction in capital expenditures in the bakken reflecting lower well costs and completion of the tioga gas plant expansion project total proceeds from the sale of assets related to continuing operations amounted to 50 million in 2015 2014 2978 million 2013 4458 million in 2014 we completed asset sales of our dry

our 2016 eampp capital and exploratory expenditure budget to approximately 24 billion down 40 from 2015 capital expenditures from our bakken midstream joint venture are expected to be approximately 340 million in 2016 forward strip crude oil prices for 2016 are below average prices for 2015 and as a result we forecast a significant net loss and a net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures in 2016 in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock par value 1 with a liquidation preference of 1000 per share of convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of approximately 16 billion we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2016 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take other steps to improve our financial position by further reducing our planned capital program and other cash outlays accessing other sources of liquidity by issuing debt and equity securities andor pursuing further asset sales see note 23 subsequent events in the notes to the

agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in january 2016 fitch ratings fitch affirmed our bbb credit rating but revised the rating outlook to negative in february 2016 standard and poors ratings services sampp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moodys investors service moodys lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade the consequence of lower credit ratings is to increase interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities in addition we have contractual requirements to provide collateral to certain counterparties when one rating agency rates our unsecured debt below investment grade due to the recent rating change by moodys we may be required to issue collateral in the form of letters of credit up to approximately 200 million certain other contracts require we provide collateral when two of three rating agencies rate us below investment grade

under leases accounted for as operating leases offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2015 we have 32 million in letters of credit for which we are contingently liable see also note 19 guarantees contingencies and commitments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements foreign operations we conduct exploration and production activities outside the us principally in europe norway and denmark africa equatorial guinea libya and ghana and asia and other joint development area of malaysiathailand malaysia    40    australia guyana and canada therefore we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations including political risk corruption acts of terrorism tax law changes and currency risk see item 1a risk factors for further details critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve month period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves for example the average west texas intermediate wti crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2015 and 2014 was 5013 and 9442 per barrel respectively the drop in prices for 2015 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31 2015 of 234 million barrels of oil equivalent primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2015 spot prices for wti crude oil closed at 3713 per barrel and averaged 3178 per barrel in january 2016 if crude oil prices in 2016 stay at levels below that used in determining 2015 proved reserves we may recognize further negative revisions up to a significant majority of our december 31 2015 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2016 above those used in determining 2015 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2016 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2016 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2016 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2016 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2015 would result in an approximate 350 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2016 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 85 through 89 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves bakken midstream joint venture  on july 1 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hess infrastructure partners lp hip to global infrastructure partners gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion we consolidate the activities of    41    hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hips governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  our impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment see note 10 impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1 or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed prior to the second quarter of 2015 we had one operating segment eampp consisting of two reporting units offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment bakken midstream which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 1098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 760 million upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment we allocated 375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of our    42    market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values  significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset in the second quarter of 2015 we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment no impairment resulted from this assessment in addition accounting standards require that following a reorganization allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30 2015 goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test as a result we recorded a noncash pretax charge of 385 million 385 million after income taxes in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting units goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards  as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed an impairment test at december 31 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1098 million 1098 million after income taxes to reflect the offshore reporting units goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling 375 million will be recovered through the bakken midstream operating segment based on market conditions at december 31 2015  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities we have net deferred tax assets of 2653 million recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2015 regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with our internal business forecasts additional valuation allowances may be required if internal business forecasts adopt lower selling price assumptions or development plans we do not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset in order to measure these obligations we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values   43    retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  environment health and safety our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting the highest standards of

committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and although not currently significant superfund sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2015 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 13 million in 2015 2014 12 million 2013 16 million the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses
