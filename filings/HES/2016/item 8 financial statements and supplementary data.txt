recognition the eampp segment recognizes revenue from the sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas when title passes to the customer differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and our entitlement share of natural gas production are not material  in our eampp activities we engage in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income    56    hess corporation and consolidated subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continued our bakken midstream segment recognizes revenue from feebased services including crude oil and natural gas gathering processing of natural gas and the fractionation of natural gas liquids terminaling and loading crude oil and natural gas liquids transportation of crude oil by rail car and the storage and terminaling of propane when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred or services rendered price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured prior to 2014 when providing natural gas processing services our bakken midstream operating segment purchased unprocessed natural gas from us and third parties and provided processing services pursuant to contracts whereby it retained a portion of the sales proceeds received and charged certain fees to customers the remaining proceeds were remitted back to customers based on the contractual arrangements  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization we record depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production facilities and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a projected amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices as a result of the prevailing low crude oil price environment we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment at december 31 2015 see note 10 impairment impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded in addition to our annual test we also performed separate goodwill impairment tests at december 31 2015 and june 30 2015 see note 10 impairment   57  hess corporation and consolidated subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continued cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is generally determined using average actual costs  income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets we consider the reversal of temporary differences the expected utilization of net operating losses and credit carryforwards during available carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors in addition we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination we do not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations we classify interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or the seabed at certain exploration and production locations we initially recognize a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred and capitalize the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset fair value is determined by applying a credit adjusted riskfree rate to the undiscounted expected future abandonment expenditures which represent level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy defined under fair value measurements below  retirement plans we recognize the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation we recognize the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees derivatives we utilize derivative instruments for financial risk management activities in these activities we may use futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by gaap these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a    58  hess corporation and consolidated subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continued particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3 netting of financial instruments we generally enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate legal and counterparty credit risk master netting arrangements are generally accepted overarching master contracts that govern all individual transactions with the same counterparty entity as a single legally enforceable agreement the us bankruptcy code provides for the enforcement of certain termination and netting rights under certain types of contracts upon the bankruptcy filing of a counterparty commonly known as the safe harbor provisions if a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterpartys bankruptcy these rights are generally enforceable with respect to safe harbor transactions if these arrangements provide the right of offset and our intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination our policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis in the normal course of business we rely on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as closeout netting including twoparty netting and single counterparty multilateral netting as applied to us twoparty netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single hess entity and single counterparty multilateral netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple hess entities we are reasonably assured that these netting rights would be upheld in a bankruptcy proceeding in the us in which the defaulting counterparty is a debtor under the us bankruptcy code sharebased compensation we account for sharebased compensation under the fair value method of accounting the fair value of all sharebased compensation is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards we

under the liquidation plan we along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy courts confirmation of hovensas liquidation plan  we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river to that end in april 2014 epa issued a focused feasibility study ffs proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion epa may issue a record of decision rod in 2016 selecting a remedy for the lower eight miles based on the ffs but the ultimate remedy and associated cost for the lower passaic river remains uncertain at this stage the rod is unlikely to address an additional nine miles of the passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of    77  hess corporation and consolidated subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continued damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies and the fact that epa has not yet selected a remedy for part or all of the lower passaic river remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed  from time to time we are involved in

sec regulations and the requirements of the financial accounting standards board proved oil and gas reserves are quantities which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations our estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by our internal teams of geoscience and reservoir engineering professionals estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic petroleum engineering and evaluation principals and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the society of petroleum engineers entitled standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information revision as of february 19 2007 the method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate the stage of reservoir development and the production history where applicable reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation as defined in the sec regulations these technologies including computational methods must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in order for reserves to be classified as proved any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project either senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the development our proved reserves are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are discussed in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k internal controls  the corporation maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation processes which are administered by the corporations director global reserves and its chief financial officer estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff who work directly with the oil and gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions and methodologies each year reserve estimates for a selection of the corporations assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews in addition an independent thirdparty reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the corporations reported reserves see pages 86 through 89 reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the board of directors qualifications  the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the

and gas industry with a bs degree in petroleum engineering his experience has been primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas mr dubois is responsible for the corporations global reserves group which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews    85    reserves audit  we engaged the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dampm to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 83 of 2015 yearend reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 2014 80 the purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with sec regulations the dampm letter report dated february 3 2016 on the corporations estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry dampm is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years dampms letter report on the corporations december 31 2015 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this

below that used in determining 2015 proved reserves we may recognize further negative revisions up to a significant majority of our december 31 2015 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2016 above those used in determining 2015 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2016 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2016 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2016 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2016 reservoir

discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves  future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining yearend reserve estimates adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and    89    gas reserves less estimated future development and production costs which are based on yearend costs and existing economic assumptions future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate yearend statutory tax rates to the pretax net cash flows as well as including the effect of tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10 the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile the prices required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows are on the same basis for determining proved oil and gas reserves and do not include the effects of commodity hedges as a result selling prices used in the disclosure of future net cash flows may not be representative of future selling prices in addition the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses the amount of tax deductions credits and allowances relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves can change year to year due to factors including changes in proved reserves variances in actual pretax cash flows from forecasted pretax cash flows in historical periods and the impact to yearend carryforward tax attributes associated with deducting in the corporations income tax returns exploration expenses interest expense and corporate general and administrative expenses that are not contemplated in the standardized measure computations the future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used
