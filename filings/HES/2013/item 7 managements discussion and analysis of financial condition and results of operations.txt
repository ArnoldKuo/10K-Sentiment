factors related to our business and operations  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future  our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity  if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others  there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties    13    table of contents  results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors  we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations under joint operating agreements in which we may share control with other parties to the agreement there is a risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or these parties may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone if we fail to jointly control operations business decisions and other actions the value of our investment may be adversely affected  we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights and changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs the doddfrank wall street reform act enacted in 2010 doddfrank act delegated rulemaking responsibilities to carry out the act to various us government agencies our business could potentially be adversely impacted by one or more of the final rules under this act including potential additional costs to engage in certain derivative transactions on august 22 2012 the securities and exchange commission issued final rules as required by the doddfrank act regarding disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers pursuant to which beginning in 2014 we will be required to provide information about payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil natural gas or minerals  political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry  our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage for example the accident at the bp operated macondo prospect in april 2010 resulted in a significant release of crude oil which caused extensive environmental and economic damage our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general  concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of unconventional oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporations operations in france  concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures and reduced demand for our products we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition we market petroleum fuels which through normal customer use result in the emission of    14    table of contents  greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of and revenues from these products finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns  our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas and in purchasing and marketing of refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs  catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks during 2012 we incurred charges for repairs and other expenses relating to the effects of hurricane sandy which hit the northeast coast of the united states although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable  item 3 legal proceedings  the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire two separate cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved in 2007 a pretax charge of 40 million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation  the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey now owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river contamination in january 2009 these companies added third party defendants including the corporation to that case in june 2007 the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action with costs ranging from 900 million to 23 billion for all parties based on adverse comments from the corporation and others the epa is reevaluating its alternatives in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages  on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor    15    table of contents  incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposes total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations  in july 2004 hess oil virgin islands corp hovic a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint  the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of

port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network following these actions over 90 percent of the corporations capital employed will be in its eampp segment the corporation also has shifted its eampp growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller more focused exploratory program the corporation intends to continue to pursue its strategy of transforming itself into an essentially eampp business focused on the corporations most promising properties and operations  on january 29 2013 elliott management corporation elliott sent a letter to hess shareholders informing them that affiliates of elliott beneficially own 4 percent

table  united states crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas production in the united states was higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play in the second quarter of 2012 production restarted from a well at the llano field after a successful workover of the well which had been shutin for mechanical reasons since the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production was higher in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to new wells in the bakken oil shale play partly offset by lower production due to the shutin well at the llano field natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to this shutin well at the llano field  europe crude oil production in 2012 was lower than 2011 primarily due to downtime at the valhall field in norway which was shutin from midjuly 2012 until january 2013 in order to complete a field redevelopment project crude oil production in 2011 was comparable to 2010 as higher production from norway and russia was largely offset by lower production from the corporations united kingdom north sea assets natural gas production was lower in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the sale of the snohvit field offshore norway in january 2012 downtime at the valhall field as noted above and natural decline at the beryl field in the united kingdom north sea natural gas production was lower in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to the sale in february 2011 of certain natural gas producing assets in the united kingdom north sea    24    table of contents africa crude oil production increased in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to the resumption of production in libya partly offset by lower production in equatorial guinea due to downtime and natural field decline following the lifting of the economic sanctions imposed in response to civil unrest the corporations production in libya resumed during the fourth quarter of 2011 after being shutin from the first quarter of 2011 crude oil production decreased in 2011 compared with 2010 due to the suspension of production in libya the exchange in september 2010 of the corporations interests in gabon for increased interests in norway lower production entitlement in equatorial guinea and algeria as a result of higher selling prices and natural decline in equatorial guinea  asia and other natural gas production in 2012 was higher than 2011 primarily due to new wells at the pangkah field in indonesia and a full years contribution from the gajah baru complex at the natuna a field in indonesia which commenced production in the fourth quarter of 2011 natural gas production in 2011 was higher than 2010 primarily due to higher nominations at block pm301 in malaysia and first production from the gajah baru complex  sales volumes higher sales volumes and other operating revenues increased revenue by approximately 1225 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and lower sales volumes and other operating revenues decreased revenue by approximately 1100 million in 2011 compared with 2010  operating costs and depreciation depletion and amortization cash operating costs consisting of production expenses and general and administrative expenses increased by 401 million in 2012 compared with 2011 and increased by 460 million in 2011 compared with 2010 the increase in 2012 reflects higher production taxes as a result of increased production volumes at the bakken oil shale play and in russia together with higher operating and maintenance costs at the valhall field in norway the llano field in the united states and the bakken the increase in costs in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to higher production taxes as a result of higher selling prices together with higher operating and maintenance expenses mainly in norway and the bakken  depreciation depletion and amortization charges increased by 548 million in 2012 and 83 million in 2011 compared with the corresponding amounts in prior years the increase in 2012 was primarily due to higher volumes and per barrel costs the increase in 2011 was primarily due to higher per barrel costs reflecting higher finding and development costs in addition the higher per barrel rates in 2012 and 2011 were largely due to greater production contribution from unconventional assets  excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods cash operating costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 2063 in 2012 1971 in 2011 and 1445 in 2010 depreciation depletion and amortization costs per barrel of oil equivalent were 1920 in 2012 1706 in 2011 and 1456 in

barrel resulting in total unit costs of 4000 to 4200 per barrel of oil equivalent  exploration expenses exploration expenses decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to lower dry hole expenses and lease amortization dry hole expenses in 2012 included amounts associated with two exploration wells ness deep in the gulf of mexico and ajek1 offshore indonesia exploration expenses increased in 2011 from 2010 mainly due to higher dry hole expenses which included amounts relating to two exploration wells on the semai v block offshore indonesia and a well in the north red sea block 1 offshore

productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill  for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its

significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures  the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  the corporations impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly  the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed the corporation has concluded that the eampp segment is the reporting unit for the purposes of testing goodwill for impairment since the eampp segment is managed globally by one segment manager who allocates financial and technical resources globally and reviews operating results at the segment level accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of that segment  if any of the eampp segment components such as our financial reporting regions united states europe africa and asia were considered to be reporting units an analysis would be performed to determine if these components were economically similar as defined in the accounting standard for goodwill asc 3502035 if components are economically similar that guidance requires that those components be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit while the corporation believes that the eampp segment is the reporting unit because of the manner in which the business is managed it also evaluated the required aggregation criteria specified in the accounting standard for segment reporting asc 280105011 and determined that its components are economically similar for the following reasons            the corporation operates its exploration and production segment as a single global business          each component produces oil and gas          the exploration and production processes are similar in each component          the methods used by each component to market and distribute oil and gas are similar          customers of each component are similar          the components share technical resources and support services  if the corporation reorganized its exploration and production business such that there was more than one reporting unit goodwill may be assigned to two or more reporting units  the corporations fair value estimate of the eampp segment is the sum of 1 the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments 2 the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets and 3 an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential    33    table of contents  synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control improved processes and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar eampp companies  the determination of the fair value of the eampp segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the eampp segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill  as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the eampp segment  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination  the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporations internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values  retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future    34    table of contents  returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporations financial statements  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy    35    table of contents details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  environment health and safety  the corporations long term vision and values

last several years many refineries have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agencys epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with the new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements in april 2012 the corporation entered into a consent decree with the epa to resolve these matters as they relate to its port reading refinery facility under the terms of the consent decree hess paid a penalty of 850000 and agreed to implement a program to reduce emissions at the refinery the emissions reduction program in the consent decree is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation in january 2013 the corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations in february at its port reading facility  the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern the corporation assesses monitors and takes measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations the corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities  the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations terminals onshore exploration and production facilities refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and although not currently significant superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party    36    table of contents the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2012 the corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 55 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporations remediation spending was 19 million in 2012 19 million in 2011 and 13 million in 2010 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards other than for the low sulfur requirements were approximately 70 million in 2012 95 million in 2011 and 85 million in 2010
