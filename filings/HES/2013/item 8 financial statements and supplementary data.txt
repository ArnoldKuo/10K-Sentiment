summary of significant accounting policies  nature of business hess corporation and its subsidiaries the corporation or hess operate in two segments exploration and production eampp and marketing and refining mampr the eampp segment explores for develops produces purchases transports and sells crude oil and natural gas the mampr segment purchases markets and trades refined petroleum products natural gas and electricity the corporation also operates terminals and retail gasoline stations most of which include convenience stores that are located on the east coast of the united states through february 2013 the corporation also manufactured refined petroleum products in january 2013 the corporation announced its decision to cease refining operations at its port reading facility in february and pursue the sale of its terminal network in january 2012 hovensa llc hovensa a 50 owned joint venture in the us virgin islands shut down its refinery hovensa plans to operate the complex as an oil storage terminal while the corporation and its joint venture partner pursue a sale of hovensa  the corporation has made significant progress in its transformation from an integrated oil and gas company to a predominantly eampp company following the shutdown of the hovensa joint venture refinery and its decision to cease refining operations at its port reading facility and pursue the sale of its terminal network the corporation has also shifted its eampp growth strategy from one based primarily on high impact exploration to one based on a combination of the development of unconventional resources exploitation of existing discoveries and a smaller more focused exploratory program principles of consolidation and basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of hess corporation and entities in which the corporation owns more than a 50 voting interest or entities that the corporation controls the corporation consolidates the trading partnership in which it owns a 50 voting interest and over which it exercises control the corporations undivided interests in unincorporated oil and gas exploration and production ventures are proportionately consolidated investments in affiliated companies 20 to 50 owned and where the corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate are accounted for using the equity method certain information in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the preparation of these financial statements the corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance  estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income actual results could differ from those estimates among the estimates made by management are oil and gas reserves asset valuations depreciable lives pension liabilities legal and environmental obligations asset retirement obligations and income taxes  revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to the customer sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the statement of consolidated income the corporation recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and the corporations share of natural gas production are not material revenues from natural gas and electricity sales by the corporations marketing operations are recognized based on meter readings and estimated deliveries to customers since the last meter reading  in its eampp activities the corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality similarly in its marketing activities the corporation enters into refined petroleum product purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred    49    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization the corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives retail gas stations and equipment related to a leased property are depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period the corporation records the cost of acquired customers in its energy marketing activities as intangible assets and amortizes these costs on the straightline method over the expected renewal period based on historical experience  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the net present value of future cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable this impairment test is calculated at the reporting unit level which for the corporations goodwill is the eampp operating segment the corporation identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its book value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount an impairment would be recorded  cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired  inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for refined petroleum product inventories valued at cost the corporation uses principally the lastin firstout lifo inventory method for the remaining inventories cost is generally determined using average actual costs    50    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method the corporation regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets the available carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in addition the corporation recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations the corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with longlived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets  retirement plans the corporation recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by gaap these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which    51    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued     generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example in its energy marketing business the corporation enters into contracts to sell natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 there may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more liquid markets which are therefore classified as level 1 or level 2 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  sharebased compensation the fair value of all sharebased compensation is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards  foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency primary currency in which business is conducted for most foreign operations adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency into the functional currency are recorded in other net in the statement of consolidated income for operations that do not use the us dollar as the functional currency adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are recorded in a separate component of equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss  maintenance and repairs maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred including costs of refinery turnarounds capital improvements are recorded as additions in property plant and equipment  environmental expenditures the corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable the corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment  changes in accounting policies effective january 1 2012 the corporation

acquisition of marquette was accounted for as a business combination and the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed were recorded at fair value the fair value measurements of the oil and gas assets were based in part on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a level 3 measurement the majority of the purchase price was assigned to unproved properties and the remainder to producing wells and working capital  in october 2011 the corporation completed the acquisition of a 50 undivided interest in consol energy incs consol approximately 200000 acres in the

standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information revision as of february 19 2007 the method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate the stage of reservoir development and the production history where applicable reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation as defined in the sec regulations these technologies including computational methods must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in order for reserves to be classified as proved any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project either senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the development the corporations proved reserves are subject

maintains internal controls over its oil and gas reserve estimation process which are administered by the corporations senior vice president of eampp technology and its chief financial officer estimates of reserves are prepared by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties using standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions and methodologies each year reserve estimates for a selection of the corporations assets are subject to internal technical audits and reviews in addition an independent third party reserve engineer reviews and audits a significant portion of the corporations reported reserves see below reserve estimates are reviewed by senior management and the board of directors  qualifications  the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the corporations oil and gas reserves is mr scott heck senior vice president of eampp technology mr heck is a member of the society of petroleum engineers and has over 30 years of experience in the oil and gas industry with a bs degree in petroleum engineering his experience includes over 15 years primarily focused on oil and gas subsurface understanding and reserves estimation in both domestic and international areas the corporations upstream technology organization which mr heck manages focuses on oil and gas industry subsurface and reservoir engineering technologies and evaluation techniques mr heck is also responsible for the corporations global reserves group which is the internal organization responsible for establishing the policies and processes used within the operating units to estimate reserves and perform internal technical reserve audits and reviews  reserves audit  the corporation engaged the consulting firm of degolyer and macnaughton dampm to perform an audit of the internally prepared reserve estimates on certain fields aggregating 76 of 2012 yearend reported reserve quantities on a barrel of oil equivalent basis 81 in 2011 the purpose of this audit was to provide additional assurance on the reasonableness of internally prepared reserve estimates and compliance with sec regulations the dampm letter report dated january 31 2013 on the corporations estimated oil and gas reserves was prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally recognized in the petroleum industry dampm is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over 70 years dampms letter report on the corporations december 31 2012 oil and gas reserves is included as an exhibit to this form 10k while the dampm report should be read in its entirety the report concludes that for the properties reviewed by dampm the total net proved reserve estimates prepared by
