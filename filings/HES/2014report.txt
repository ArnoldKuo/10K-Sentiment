pdvsa had previously shut down its refinery in st croix us virgin islands in january 2012 and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal during 2012 and continuing into 2013 hovensa and the government of the virgin islands negotiated a plan to pursue the sale of hovensa and the sales process commenced in the fourth quarter if an agreement to sell the refinery cannot be reached hovensa will likely not be able to continue operating as an oil storage terminal for further discussion of the refinery shutdown see note 10 hovensa llc joint venture in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  competition and market conditions  see item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations for a discussion of competition and market conditions  other items  emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures  the corporation has in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities  responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of the corporations plans the corporations contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented  to complement internal capabilities and to ensure coverage for its global operations the corporation maintains membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis national response corporation nrc and oil spill response osr cga is a regional spill response organization and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osr are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 300000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support hess has contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if the corporation were to engage these organizations to    11    table of contents  obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committee of cga and the board of directors of osr  the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes  insurance coverage and indemnification  the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages  the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporations property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 238 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance which provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 105 billion  the corporations insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable  generally the corporations drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis  the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of fault including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly many offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount  under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa not covered by or in excess of insurance carried by the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party in which case such party is solely liable however under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the governmental entity is joint and several  environmental  compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition or results of operations the corporation spent approximately 16 million in 2013 for environmental remediation principally relating to the downstream businesses the corporation anticipates capital expenditures for eampp facilities primarily to comply with    12    table of contents  federal state and local environmental standards of approximately 65 million in 2014 and approximately 50 million in 2015 the corporation anticipates capital expenditures for the downstream businesses of approximately 8 million in 2014 for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  number of employees  the number of persons employed by the corporation at yearend was approximately 12225 in 2013 and 14775 in 2012 the reduction in the number of employees between 2013 and 2012 was largely a result of the corporations asset sales program of the employees remaining at yearend approximately 8800 in 2013 approximately 9500 in 2012 were employed in the corporations downstream businesses that are due to be divested  other  the corporations internet address

stock exchange nyse its annual certification that the corporations chief executive officer is unaware of any violation of the nyses corporate governance standards  item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future  our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation utilizes significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility  if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be    13    table of contents  achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others  there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors  we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected  we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities as well as other political developments may affect our operations as a result of the accident in april 2010 at the bp plc bp operated macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico in which the corporation was not a participant and the ensuing significant oil spill a temporary drilling moratorium was imposed in the gulf of mexico while this moratorium has since been lifted significant new regulations have been imposed and further legislation and regulations may be proposed the new regulatory environment has resulted in a longer permitting process and higher costs we also transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and may result in heightened regulatory scrutiny that may lead to an increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely impact our operations  political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally for example production at the waha fields in libya which has a net production capacity of approximately 25000 boepd has been shutin since august 2013 and was also shutin for eight months in 2011 due to civil unrest the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry  our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general  concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost for example a moratorium prohibiting hydraulic fracturing is currently impacting the corporations exploration activities in france    14    table of contents concerns about climate change may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business finally to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events we could experience increased costs related to prevention maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to higher costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns  our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs  catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable  cyberattacks targeting our computer and telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations the loss or corruption of our data and proprietary information and communications interruptions in addition computers control oil and gas distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack impacting these distribution systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations  item 3 legal proceedings  the corporation along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe in 2008 the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled in 2010 and 2011 additional cases were settled including an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire cases brought by the state of new jersey and the commonwealth of puerto rico remain unresolved the corporation has reserves recorded which it believes are adequate to cover its expected liability in these cases    15    table of contents the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages  on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations  in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources the cercla claims have been dismissed and a trial is scheduled in june 2014 on the remaining claims hovic and hovensa are continuing to vigorously defend this matter and do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses against this complaint  the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material  the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation  item 4 mine safety disclosures  none    16

accounting policies  critical accounting policies and estimates  accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the corporations consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however the corporations accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity  accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill  for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties the corporations technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical    35    table of contents  audits and senior management review the corporation also engages an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of the corporations total proved reserves  impairment of longlived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing the corporation reviews longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements  in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures  the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices  the corporations impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly  the corporations goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation has concluded that within its eampp segment it has two reporting units offshore and onshore consistent with the manner in which performance is assessed by the segment manager accordingly the corporation expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operations of each of its reporting units  the corporations fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar onshore and offshore peer companies the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in an impairment of goodwill  as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level  income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination  the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions including the united states and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if it is more likely than not that some or all of the    36    table of contents  deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets the corporation refers to the reversal periods for available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards temporary differences the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets and estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporations internal business forecasts additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in order to measure these obligations the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result the corporations estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values  retirement plans the corporation has funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan the corporation recognizes in the consolidated balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate the corporations projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporations financial statements  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates in trading activities the corporation principally through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings    37    table of contents derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an ongoing basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices  fair value measurements the corporations derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period as appropriate the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill  the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example the corporation sold natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows    38    table of contents environment health and safety  the corporations long term vision and values

corporation is committed to complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at its facilities  the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities and although not currently significant superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party  the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at yearend 2013 the corporations reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 65 million the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites the corporations remediation spending was approximately 16 million in 2013 and 19 million in both 2012 and 2011 capital expenditures for facilities primarily to comply with federal state and local environmental standards were approximately 100 million in 2013 70 million in 2012 and 95 million in 2011  forwardlooking

results to differ from these statements see item 1a risk factors related to our business and operations  item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  in the normal course of its business the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values in the disclosures that follow risk management activities are referred to as corporate risk management activities the corporation also has trading operations through a 50 voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energyrelated commodities securities and derivatives these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed  in november 2013 the corporation completed the sale of its energy marketing business to direct energy a north american subsidiary of centrica plc centrica certain derivative contracts including new transactions following the closing date the delayed transfer derivative contracts have not been transferred to direct energy as required customer or regulatory consents have not been obtained however the agreement entered into between hess and direct energy on the closing date transfers all economic risks and rewards of the energy marketing business including the ownership of the    39    table of contents  delayed transfer derivative contracts to direct energy as a result the assets and liabilities related to the delayed transfer derivative contracts remain on the corporations consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2013 but changes in their fair value are offset based on the terms of the agreement between hess and direct energy the corporation therefore has no market risk related to these delayed transfer derivative contracts and only retains credit risk exposure which has been guaranteed by centrica it is expected that the transfer of these contracts will be substantially complete in the first half of 2014  controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy which the corporations senior management has approved controls include volumetric term and value at risk limits the chief risk officer must approve the trading of new instruments or commodities risk limits are monitored and are reported on a daily basis to business units and senior management the corporations risk management department also performs independent price verifications ipvs of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models these controls apply to all of the corporations risk management and trading activities including the consolidated trading partnership the corporations treasury department is responsible for administering and monitoring foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs using similar controls and processes where applicable  the corporation uses value at risk to monitor and control commodity risk within its risk management and trading activities the value at risk model uses historical simulation and the results represent the potential loss in fair value over one day at a 95 confidence level the model captures both first and second order sensitivities for options results may vary from time to time as strategies change in trading activities or hedging levels change in risk management activities  instruments the corporation primarily uses forward commodity contracts foreign exchange forward contracts futures swaps options and energy commodity based securities in its risk management and trading activities these contracts are generally widely traded instruments with standardized terms the following describes these instruments and how the corporation uses them            forward commodity contracts the corporation enters into contracts for the forward purchase and sale of commodities at settlement date the notional value of the contract is exchanged for physical delivery of the commodity forward contracts that are deemed normal purchase and sale contracts are excluded from the quantitative market risk disclosures            forward foreign exchange contracts the corporation enters into forward contracts primarily for the british pound and the thai baht which commit the corporation to buy or sell a fixed amount of these currencies at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date            exchange traded contracts the corporation uses exchange traded contracts including futures on a number of different underlying energy commodities these contracts are settled daily with the relevant exchange and may be subject to exchange position limits            swaps the corporation uses financially settled swap contracts with third parties as part of its risk management and trading activities cash flows from swap contracts are determined based on underlying commodity prices or interest rates and are typically settled over the life of the contract            options options on various underlying energy commodities include exchange traded and third party contracts and have various exercise periods as a seller of options the corporation receives a premium at the outset and bears the risk of unfavorable changes in the price of the commodity underlying the option as a purchaser of options the corporation pays a premium at the outset and has the right to participate in the favorable price movements in the underlying commodities            energy securities energy securities include energyrelated equity or debt securities issued by a company or government or related derivatives on these securities  corporate risk management activities  corporate risk management activities include transactions designed to reduce risk in the selling prices of crude oil or natural gas produced by the corporation or to reduce exposure to foreign currency or interest rate movements generally futures swaps or option strategies may be used to reduce risk in the selling price of a portion of the corporations crude oil or natural gas production forward contracts may also be used to purchase certain currencies in which the corporation does    40    table of contents  business with the intent of reducing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations interest rate swaps may also be used generally to convert fixedrate interest payments to floating  the corporation has entered into brent crude oil fixed price swap contracts to hedge 25000 boepd for calendar year 2014 at an average price of 10912 per barrel the corporation has outstanding foreign exchange contracts used to reduce its exposure to fluctuating foreign exchange rates for various currencies the change in fair value of foreign exchange contracts from a 10 strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate is estimated to be a gain of approximately 4 million at december 31 2013  the corporations outstanding longterm debt of 5798 million including current maturities had a fair value of 6641 million at december 31 2013 a 15 decrease in the rate of interest would increase the fair value of debt by approximately 160 million at december 31 2013 a 15 increase in the rate of interest would decrease the fair value of debt by approximately 150 million at december 31 2013  following is the value at risk for the corporations risk management commodity derivatives activities associated with continuing

prior to 2013 the corporation also operated a marketing and refining mampr segment which it began to divest during the year the mampr businesses manufacture refined petroleum products and purchase market store and trade refined products natural gas and electricity as well as operate retail gas stations most of which have convenience stores see also note 21 segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporations reportable segments at december 31 2013  in the first quarter of 2013 the corporation announced several initiatives to continue its transformation into a more focused pure play eampp company the transformation plan included fully exiting the corporations mampr businesses including its terminal retail energy marketing and energy trading operations as well as the permanent shutdown of refining operations at its port reading facility thus completing its exit from all refining operations hovensa llc hovensa a 5050 joint venture between the corporations subsidiary hess oil virgin islands corp hovic and a subsidiary of petroleos de venezuela sa pdvsa had previously shut down its united states us virgin islands refinery in january 2012 and continued operating solely as an oil storage terminal hovic and its partner have also commenced a sales process for hovensa the transformation plan also committed to the

production ventures are proportionately consolidated investments in affiliated companies 20 to 50 owned and where the corporation has the ability to influence the operating or financial decisions of the affiliate are accounted for using the equity method  the 2012 and 2011 financial information has been recast so that the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the 2013 financial information which reflects the results of operations and cash flows of the corporations divested downstream businesses as discontinued operations for all periods presented see note 3 discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements certain other information in the financial statements and notes has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation in the preparation of these financial statements the corporation has evaluated subsequent events through the date of issuance  estimates and assumptions in preparing financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income actual results could differ from those estimates estimates made by management include oil and gas reserves asset and other valuations depreciable lives pension liabilities legal and environmental obligations asset retirement obligations and income taxes  revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenues from the sale of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and other merchandise when title passes to the customer sales are reported net of excise and similar taxes in the statement of consolidated income the corporation recognizes revenues from the production of natural gas properties based on sales to customers differences between eampp natural gas volumes sold and the corporations share of natural gas production are not material  in its eampp activities the corporation engages in crude oil purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another for the primary purpose of changing location or quality similarly in its marketing activities the corporation enters into refined petroleum product purchase and sale transactions with the same counterparty these arrangements are reported net in sales and other operating revenues in the statement of consolidated income  exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of    52    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued     drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred  the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of a project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors firm plans for additional drilling and other factors  depreciation depletion and amortization the corporation records depletion expense for acquisition costs of proved properties using the units of production method over proved oil and gas reserves depreciation and depletion expense for oil and gas production equipment and wells is calculated using the units of production method over proved developed oil and gas reserves provisions for impairment of undeveloped oil and gas leases are based on periodic evaluations and other factors depreciation of all other plant and equipment is determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives retail gas stations and equipment related to leased properties are depreciated over the estimated useful lives not to exceed the remaining lease period  capitalized interest interest from external borrowings is capitalized on material projects using the weighted average cost of outstanding borrowings until the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use which for oil and gas assets is at first production from the field capitalized interest is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets in the same manner as the depreciation of the underlying assets  impairment of longlived assets the corporation reviews longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered if the carrying amounts are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the net present value of future cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from the average prices used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  impairment of equity investees the corporation reviews equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary decline in value may have occurred the fair value measurement used in the impairment assessment is based on quoted market prices where available or other valuation techniques including discounted cash flows  impairment of goodwill the corporations goodwill is assigned to the eampp operating segment goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable this impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level which accounting standards define as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment following a reorganization of its management structure in 2013 the corporation determined its reporting units are its onshore and offshore businesses and tests for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its book value including goodwill if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the corporation calculates the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount an impairment would be recorded  cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired    53    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market for refined petroleum product inventories valued at cost the corporation uses principally the lastin firstout lifo inventory method for the remaining inventories cost is generally determined using average actual costs  income taxes deferred income taxes are determined using the liability method the corporation regularly assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets based on estimates of future taxable income the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets the available carryforward periods for net operating losses and other factors if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in addition the corporation recognizes the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination additionally the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations the corporation classifies interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as income tax expense  asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of legally required asset retirement obligations associated with longlived assets in the period in which the retirement obligations are incurred in addition the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated the corporation capitalizes the associated asset retirement costs as part of the carrying amount of the longlived assets  retirement plans the corporation recognizes the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation the corporation recognizes the net changes in the funded status of these plans in the year in which such changes occur prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees  derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities in risk management activities the corporation uses futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in prices of crude oil natural gas refined petroleum products and electricity as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates the corporation through a consolidated partnership trades energyrelated commodities and derivatives including futures forwards options and swaps based on expectations of future market conditions  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporations consolidated balance sheet the corporations policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss while the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value is recorded currently in earnings amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings  fair value measurements the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value including the market and income approaches the corporations fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and the corporations credit is considered for accrued liabilities  the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by gaap these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill    54    table of contents hess corporation and consolidated subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements  continued    the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy  details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows  fair value measurements based on level 1 inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity the fair value of certain of the corporations exchange traded futures and options are considered level 1  fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 measurements based on level 2 inputs include overthecounter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level 2 inputs for certain forwards swaps and options  fair value measurements based on level 3 inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations for example the corporation entered into contracts to sell natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations which are classified as level 3 there may be offsets to these positions that are priced based on more liquid markets which are therefore classified as level 1 or level 2 fair values determined using discounted cash flows and other unobservable data are also classified as level 3  sharebased compensation the fair value of all sharebased compensation is recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards the corporation estimates the fair value of employee stock options at the date of grant using a blackscholes valuation model performance share units using a monte carlo simulation model and restricted stock based on the market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant  foreign currency translation the us dollar is the functional currency primary currency in which business is conducted for most foreign operations adjustments resulting from translating monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a nonfunctional currency into the functional currency are recorded in other net in the statement of consolidated income for operations that do not use the us dollar as the functional currency adjustments resulting from translating foreign currency assets and liabilities into us dollars are recorded in a separate component of equity titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss  maintenance and repairs maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred capital improvements are recorded as additions in property plant and equipment  environmental expenditures the corporation accrues and expenses environmental costs on an undiscounted basis to remediate existing conditions related to past operations when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable the corporation capitalizes environmental expenditures that increase the life or efficiency of property or reduce or prevent future adverse impacts to the environment    55    table of contents hess

severance charges primarily resulted from the corporations divestiture program announced in march 2013 which was initiated to continue its transformation to a more focused pure play eampp company the severance charges were based on probable amounts incurred under ongoing severance arrangements or other statutory requirements plus amounts earned through december 31 2013 under enhanced benefit arrangements the expense associated with the enhanced benefits is recognized ratably over the estimated service period required for the employee to earn the benefit upon termination  the corporation expects to incur additional enhanced benefit charges of approximately 30 million beyond the amounts accrued at december 31 2013 of which 5 million relates to eampp 10 million to retail marketing and

bankruptcy filing of a counterparty commonly known as the safe harbor provisions if a master netting arrangement provides for termination and netting upon the counterpartys bankruptcy these rights are generally enforceable with respect to safe harbor transactions if these arrangements provide the right of offset and the corporations intent and practice is to offset amounts in the case of such a termination the corporations policy is to record the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis  in the normal course of business the corporation relies on legal and credit risk mitigation clauses providing for adequate credit assurance as well as closeout netting including twoparty netting and single counterparty multilateral netting as applied to the corporation twoparty netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions between a single defaulting counterparty entity and a single hess entity and single counterparty multilateral netting is the right to net amounts owing under safe harbor transactions among a single defaulting counterparty entity and multiple hess entities the corporation is reasonably assured that these netting rights would

which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2  when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market to value derivatives that are characterized as level 2 and 3 the corporation uses observable inputs for similar instruments that are available from exchanges pricing services or broker quotes these observable inputs may be supplemented with other methods including internal extrapolation or interpolation that result in the most representative prices for instruments with similar characteristics multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however

reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations the corporations estimation of net recoverable quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed by internal teams of geoscience professionals and reservoir engineers estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic petroleum engineering and evaluation principals and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the society of petroleum engineers entitled standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas reserves information revision as of february 19 2007 the method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir is based on the maturity of the reservoir the completeness of the subsurface data available at the time of the estimate the stage of reservoir development and the production history where applicable reliable technologies may be used in reserve estimation as defined in the sec regulations these technologies including computational methods must have been field tested and demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation in order for reserves to be classified as proved any required government approvals must be obtained and depending on the cost of the project either senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the development the corporations proved reserves are subject

undeveloped reserves overall volumes of proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 28 million boe compared with yearend 2012 additions and revisions in proved undeveloped reserves from existing fields amounted to 123 million boe primarily in the united states these increases resulted from ongoing technical assessments performance evaluations and additional planned development activities in 2013 88 million boe were converted from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves resulting from continuing development activity and new wells principally in north dakota and the gulf of mexico

gas reserves  future net cash flows are calculated by applying prescribed oil and gas selling prices used in determining yearend reserve estimates adjusted for price changes provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future development and production costs which are based on yearend costs and existing economic assumptions future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate yearend statutory tax rates to the pretax net cash flows relating to the corporations proved oil and gas reserves future net cash flows are discounted at the prescribed rate of 10 the discounted future net cash flow estimates do not include exploration expenses interest expense or corporate general and administrative expenses the selling prices of crude oil and natural gas are highly volatile the prices which are required to be used for the discounted future net cash flows do not include the effects of hedges and may not be representative of future selling prices the future net cash flow estimates could be materially different if other assumptions were used    92    table of contents                          at

the us virgin islands the original concession agreement was entered into on september 1 1965 on november 5 2013 hovensa entered into the fourth amendment to the concession agreement that provides for a process to sell the oil refinery and related facilities which has commenced the company has opened a data room and has retained an investment advisor the concession agreement can be extended with virgin islands government approval which has occurred on four previous occasions  shutdown of refinery in december 2011 the companys members agreed to shut down refining operations effective january 18 2012 as a result of this decision the company recorded noncash charges totaling 2072600 in december 2011 to fully impair its property plant and equipment and recognize certain other expenses related to the shutdown decision following the refinery shutdown the company redeemed its outstanding debt liquidated a majority of its inventory and settled a portion of its liabilities in 2012 additional shutdown related charges totaling 152759 were recorded primarily for the estimated legal obligations for hydrocarbon removal and tank cleaning costs  basis of presentation  the accompanying financial statements of hovensa have been prepared in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap as further explained in notes 2 and 3 below the company fully impaired its property plant and equipment and recorded certain refinery shutdown costs at december 31 2011 refinery shutdown activities occurred in 2012 and 2013 the company received financial support from the members in 2012 to fund a portion of the expenditures for the refinery shutdown and conversion to an oil storage terminal  the members primary objective is to sell the refinery and related facilities the company believes that it has cash reserves that are only sufficient to fund its operations through the first three quarters of 2014 and the members currently do not anticipate providing any additional funding to the company if an agreement to sell the refinery cannot be reached the company will likely not be able to continue operating the facility as an oil storage terminal  use of estimates  in preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of operations actual results could differ from those estimates among the estimates made by management are asset impairments refinery shutdown costs inventory and other asset valuations legal and environmental obligations and pension liabilities  revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of petroleum products when title passes to the customer which generally occurs when products are shipped or delivered in accordance with the terms of the respective sales agreements  in addition the company provides storage and other related services for thirdparty customers tank storage and related revenue is recognized in the period the service is provided product stored remains the property of these thirdparty customers    108    table

convertible into cash and have maturities of three months or less when acquired  inventories  inventories of crude oil and refined products used in refining operations were valued at the lower of lastin firstout lifo cost or market other inventories including refined products purchased for resale or used in operations as well as materials and supplies are valued at the lower of average cost or market  depreciation  depreciation of refinery facilities through december 31 2011 was determined principally on the unitsofproduction method based on estimated production volumes depreciation of all other equipment was determined on the straightline method based on estimated useful lives  maintenance and repairs  maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred  impairment of longlived assets  longlived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair market value of the assets  asset retirement obligations  asset retirement obligations must be recorded at fair value in the period in which it is determined that a legal obligation exists and a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the liability can be made  environmental expenditures  liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated other than for assessments the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action environmental liabilities are based on best estimates of probable undiscounted future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change  income taxes  the company is a limited liability company and as a result income taxes are the responsibility of the members accordingly no effect of income tax has been recognized in the accompanying financial statements  retirement plans  the company recognizes on its balance sheet the underfunded status of its defined benefit retirement plans measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligations the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation    109    table of contents hovensa llc  notes to financial statements  continued  dollars in thousands     in the case of the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and the projected postretirement benefit obligation for the postretirement medical plan the company recognizes the net changes in the plan assets and benefit obligations of its defined benefit retirement plans in the year in which such changes occur  prior service costs and gains and losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees  the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets and rate of future increases in compensation levels these assumptions represent estimates made by the company some of which can be affected by external factors      2 asset impairment and refinery shutdown related charges  on january 18 2012 hovensa announced the decision to shut down its refinery operations after experiencing substantial operating losses due to global economic conditions and competitive disadvantages versus other refiners such losses were incurred despite efforts to improve operating performance by reducing refining capacity to 350000 barrels per day from 500000 barrels per day in the first half of 2011 operating losses were also projected to continue the company prepared an impairment analysis as of december 31 2011 which indicated that undiscounted future cash flows would not recover the carrying value of its assets as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 1900349 representing the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair market value of property plant and equipment at december 31 2011 estimated fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows a level 3 fair value measure in addition the company recorded other charges totaling 172251 for obligations incurred in 2011 related to the decision to shut down the refinery including recognition of legally required employee and contractor severance costs of 66200 and reductions in
