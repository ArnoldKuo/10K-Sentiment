per operated well averaged 48 million in 2016 down 17 from 2015 in 2016 we also increased our standard well design to a 50stage completion from the previous 35stage completion the improved efficiency of our drilling operations can largely be attributed to application of our lean manufacturing capabilities during 2017 we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs for an average of 35 rigs to drill approximately 80 wells and to bring approximately 75 wells on production net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95000 boepd to 105000 boepd with the building

authorities responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl we continue to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes insurance coverage and indemnification we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 319 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault    13      variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several environmental compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 10 million in 2016 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations number of employees at december 31 2016 we had 2304 employees website access to our reports we make available free of charge through our website at wwwhesscom our

business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas average prices for 2016 were 4347 per barrel for wti 2015 4876 2014 9291 and 4513 per barrel for brent 2015 5360 2014 9945 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2017 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2016 it could have an adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our eampp operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest    15      moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2016 we had a significant net loss and if commodity prices remain low through 2017 we are forecasting a net loss for 2017 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in february 2016 standard and poors ratings services sampp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moodys investors service moodys lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade in december 2016 fitch ratings fitch lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook in february 2017 sampp reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb with stable outlook although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all in addition further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our    16      sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the eampp industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on    17      our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addition as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks item 1b unresolved staff comments none item 3 legal proceedings we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy courts confirmation of hovensas liquidation plan which is described below the remaining open matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site in april 2014 the epa issued a focused feasibility study ffs proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length  in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   18      on january 18 2017 we entered into a consent decree with the north dakota department of health resolving alleged noncompliance with north dakotas air pollution laws and provisions of the federal clean air act pursuant to the consent decree we are required to implement corrective actions including implementation of a leak detection and repair program at most of our existing facilities in north dakota we were assessed a base penalty of 922000 which is subject to adjustment based on the date we complete corrective actions required under the terms of the consent decree we made an initial penalty payment of 55000 during the first quarter of 2017  we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epas claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material we are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows item 4 mine

exploration development production transportation purchase and sale of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas with production operations located primarily in the united states us denmark equatorial guinea the malaysiathailand joint development area jda malaysia and norway the bakken midstream operating segment which was established in the second quarter of 2015 provides feebased services including gathering compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating natural gas liquids or ngls gathering terminaling loading and transporting crude oil and ngls and storing and terminaling propane primarily in the bakken and three forks shale plays in the williston basin area of north dakota response to low oil prices in 2016 our industry continued to face a challenging commodity price environment leading to further reductions in capital investment compared with 2015 our realized crude oil selling prices including hedging were 3920 per barrel in 2016 2015 4785 2014 9259 in response we improved operating efficiency across our portfolio and reduced our eampp capital and exploratory expenditures during 2016 to 19 billion a decrease of over 50 compared to the same period in 2015 which partially contributed to our lower 2016 oil and gas production levels  in addition to improving our operating efficiency and reducing our capital and exploratory expenditures we proactively took other steps in 2016 to preserve the strength of our balance sheet and improve liquidity including issuing equity securities and executing a debt refinancing transaction in february 2016 we issued 28750000 shares of common stock and depositary shares representing 575000 shares of 8 series a mandatory convertible preferred stock for total net proceeds of 16 billion in the third quarter of 2016 we initiated a debt refinancing transaction by issuing 1 billion of 430 notes due in 2027 and 500 million of 580 notes due in 2047 with proceeds used primarily to purchase highercoupon bonds and redeem nearterm maturities at december 31 2016 we had 27 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity including available committed credit facilities of approximately 73 billion we project our eampp capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately 225 billion in 2017 as we plan to increase from two rigs to six rigs in the bakken over the course of 2017 capital expenditures for our midstream operations are expected to be approximately 190 million oil and gas production in 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 300000 boepd to 310000 boepd excluding any contribution from libya as a result of reduced capital expenditures in 2016 and a high level of planned maintenance in the second quarter of 2017 we forecast our production to decline during the first half of 2017 and then increase in the third and fourth quarters of the year with the startup of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico expected in the third quarter and production increases as a result of the rig ramp up in the bakken in 2016 we realized a net operating cash flow deficit cash flow from operating activities less cash flows from investing activities of 1295 million forward strip crude oil prices for 2017 are higher than average prices for 2016 and as a result we forecast a smaller net operating cash flow deficit in 2017 we expect to fund our net operating cash flow deficit including capital expenditures for the full year of 2017 with cash on hand due to the low commodity price environment we may take any of the following steps or a combination thereof to improve our liquidity and financial position reduce our planned capital program and other cash outlays borrow from our committed credit facilities issue debt or equity securities and pursue asset sales consolidated results net loss attributable to hess corporation was 6132 million in 2016 and 3056 million in 2015 in 2014 net income attributable to hess corporation was 2317 million excluding items affecting comparability summarized on page 27 the adjusted net loss was 1489 million in 2016 and 1113 million in 2015 adjusted net income in 2014 was 1308 million annual production averaged 322000 boepd in 2016 375000 boepd in 2015 and 329000 boepd in 2014 total proved reserves were 1109 million boe 1086 million boe and 1431 million boe at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively lower crude oil prices in 2015 resulted in negative revisions of 234 million boe at december 31 2015 primarily related to proved undeveloped reserves    23    significant 2016 activities the following is an update of significant eampp activities during 2016 producing eampp assets          in north dakota net production from the bakken oil shale play averaged 105000 boepd 2015 112000 boepd with the decrease from the prioryear period primarily due to reduced drilling activity in response to low oil prices during 2016 we operated an average of 33 rigs drilled 71 wells completed 92 wells and brought on production 100 wells bringing the total operated production wells to 1272 at december 31 2016 drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged 48 million in 2016 down 17 from 2015 in 2016 we also increased our standard well design to a 50stage completion from the previous 35stage completion during 2017 we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs for an average of 35 rigs to drill approximately 80 wells and bring approximately 75 wells on production net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95000 boepd and 105000 boepd with the building rig count we expect our bakken production in the fourth quarter of 2017 to average between 105000 boepd and 110000 boepd which would represent a growth rate of approximately 15 from the first quarter to the fourth quarter          in the gulf of mexico net production averaged 61000 boepd 2015 77000 boepd the decrease in production was the result of unplanned well downtime at the tubular bells field hess 57 due to subsurface valve failures in three wells unplanned downtime at the conger field hess 38 due to a failed subsurface valve in one well and natural decline well workovers were conducted to replace the subsurface valves in the three wells at the tubular bells field and in the well at the conger field which caused an increase in workover expense for the year in addition we brought online a fifth production well and one water injection well at tubular bells during the year in 2017 gulf of mexico production is forecast to average approximately 65000 boepd          at the valhall field offshore norway net production averaged 28000 boepd 2015 33000 boepd with the decrease from the prior year primarily due to lower drilling activity natural field decline and a planned shutdown net production from the valhall field is forecast to average between 25000 boepd and 30000 boepd in 2017 in 2017 the operator plans to drill two production wells

the operator carigali hess operating company continued drilling production wells and completed commissioning of its booster compression project in the third quarter of 2016 production averaged 206 mmcfd 2015 255 mmcfd including contribution from unitized acreage in malaysia with the decrease from prioryear primarily due to lower entitlement and downtime associated with commissioning of the new booster compression project production from the jda is forecast to average approximately 210 mmcfd in 2017          in the north malay basin nmb net production from the early production system averaged 26 mmcfd 2015 40 mmcfd in 2016 we completed the installation of three remote wellhead platforms and the jacket of the central processing platform we also achieved mechanical completion of the central processing platform topsides and transport to the field via a heavy lift vessel is planned for the first quarter of 2017 the full field development project is planned for completion in the third quarter of 2017 after which net production is expected to increase to 165 mmcfd          at the south arne field offshore denmark we completed drilling of an eleven well multiyear program early in 2016 net production averaged 13000 boepd 2015 13000 boepd in the fourth quarter the danish government awarded a 20 year extension to the south arne field license extending expiry to 2047 net production is forecast to average approximately 12000 boepd in 2017          in the utica shale we drilled and completed 6 wells and brought 14 wells onto production before suspending drilling activities during the first quarter of 2016 in response to low commodity prices net production increased to 29000 boepd in 2016 2015 24000 boepd and is expected to average between 15000 boepd and 20000 boepd in 2017          in equatorial guinea net production was 33000 boepd in 2016 down from 43000 boepd in 2015 due to lower drilling activity and natural field decline net production in 2017 is expected to average approximately 25000 boepd          in libya civil and political unrest has largely interrupted production and crude oil export capability in 2016 at the waha fields hess 8 the operator recommenced production in october 2016 following the lifting of force majeure by the national oil company of libya net production from the waha fields averaged 1000 boepd for the year    24    other eampp assets          at the hess operated stampede development project hess 25 in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico the topsides deck was installed on the hull and fabrication and precommissioning of topsides continue as planned we also completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers in the field drilled one development well and commenced drilling on one water injector well in 2017 we plan to install the tension leg platform and topsides complete the subsea installation and continue our drilling operations with introduction of a second drilling rig first production from the field is targeted for 2018 and is expected to ramp up to a net rate of approximately 15000 boepd          in guyana at the offshore stabroek block hess 30 the operator esso exploration and production guyana limited completed a 3d seismic acquisition program covering approximately 17000 square kilometers on the block and drilled two successful appraisal wells at the liza discovery the liza2 well was drilled to a total depth of 17963 feet and encountered more than 190 feet of oilbearing sandstone reservoirs in the upper cretaceous formations and included an extended drill stem test the liza3 well was drilled to a total depth of 18098 feet and encountered 210 feet of the same oilbearing reservoirs encountered in other liza wells predevelopment planning and appraisal activities are underway and we expect to be in a position to sanction the first phase of the liza development in mid2017 with first production expected in 2020 in 2016 the operator also drilled the payara1 exploration well at the payara prospect located approximately 10 miles northwest of the liza discovery and encountered more than 95 feet of oilbearing sandstone reservoirs at the skipjack prospect 25 miles northwest of the liza discovery the operator completed the drilling of an exploration well which was unsuccessful and expensed in 2017 the operator plans to drill a well at the snoek exploration prospect a liza4 appraisal well and a payara2 appraisal well in addition the operator will evaluate additional exploration opportunities on the broader stabroek block          at the equus project on block wa390p in the offshore carnarvon basin of australia we were awarded a retention lease through 2021 covering certain areas within the wa390p license which include our equus discoveries in addition we also completed drilling of an exploration commitment well at the wa474p license which is adjacent to block wa390p in the fourth quarter of 2016 we terminated a joint frontend engineering study with a third party natural gas liquefaction joint venture and notified the government of australia of our intent to defer further development of the project as a result we recognized an aftertax charge of 693 million 938 million pretax to expense all previously capitalized exploratory well costs and other project related costs           in ghana we continued development planning and subsurface evaluation the government of côte divoire has challenged the maritime border between it and the country of ghana which includes a portion of our deepwater tanocape three points license we are unable to proceed with development of this license until there is a resolution of this matter which may also impact our ability to develop the license the international tribunal for law of the sea is expected to render a final ruling on the maritime border dispute in 2017 under terms of our license and subject to resolution of the border dispute we have declared commerciality for four discoveries including the pecan field in march 2016 which would be the primary development hub for the block we are continuing to work with the government on how best to progress work on the block given the maritime border dispute see capitalized exploratory well costs in note 4 property plant and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements           at the nonoperated sicily prospect in the keathley canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico where two exploration wells discovered hydrocarbons we decided in 2016 not to pursue the project due to the low oil price environment and the limited time remaining on the leases the costs of both wells were expensed in 2016          at the nonoperated melmar prospect in the alaminos canyon area of the deepwater gulf of mexico the operator completed drilling of an exploration well in 2016 where noncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons were encountered and well costs were expensed the following is an update of significant bakken midstream activities during 2016          we continued to progress the construction of facilities and the reconfiguration of pipelines in mckenzie and williams counties that are

to average between 300000 boepd and 310000 boepd in 2017 excluding any contribution from libya our production has been decreasing the last several quarters as a result of reducing our capital expenditures to manage in the lower price environment we expect our production will continue to decline in the first half of 2017 as a result of this reduced spend and a high level of planned maintenance at four of our offshore assets in the second quarter we forecast production to average between 290000 boepd and 300000 boepd in the first quarter and between 270000 boepd and 280000 boepd in the second quarter production is then forecast to increase in the third quarter with the startup of north malay basin and a new well at the penn state field in the gulf of mexico to between 305000 boepd and 315000 boepd we expect our production will continue to grow in the fourth quarter as bakken production increases as a result of the rig ramp up and the first new valhall well comes online fourth quarter production is forecast to average between 330000 boepd and 340000 boepd  production variances related to 2016 2015 and 2014 can be summarized as follows united states onshore crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to reduced drilling activity in the bakken shale play in response to low oil prices while the increase in natural gas liquids production was primarily due to greater processed volumes at the tioga gas plant onshore natural gas production was higher in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a higher number of wells being on production in the utica shale play relative to the prior year total offshore production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to subsurface valve failures in three wells at the tubular bells field a shutin well to replace a subsurface valve at the conger field extended planned shutdowns    30    on thirdparty hosted production facilities at the tubular bells and conger fields and natural field decline onshore crude oil and natural gas liquids production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to continued drilling in the bakken oil shale play while the increase in natural gas production was primarily attributable to the bakken and the utica shale offshore production increased in 2015 relative to 2014 as higher production from the tubular bells field which came online in november 2014 was offset primarily by lower production from the llano conger and shenzi fields  europe crude oil production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower drilling activity natural field decline and a planned shutdown at the valhall field offshore norway crude oil and natural gas production was higher in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to less facility downtime and new wells at the valhall field in 2015  africa crude oil production in africa was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 as a result of reduced drilling activity in equatorial guinea and the sale of our algeria asset in the fourth quarter of 2015 where net production for 2015 amounted to 7000 boepd crude oil production in africa was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 due to libyan production being shutin force majeure declared by the national oil company of libya was lifted in september 2016 and net production averaged 1000 boepd in 2016 asia natural gas production was lower in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to the planned shutdown of production facilities at the jda in 2016 to commission the booster compressor project and from lower production entitlement natural gas production was lower in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to asset sales partially offset by higher production at the jda as a result of higher facility uptime sales volumes the impact of lower sales volumes decreased

hess operated wells or other thirdparties as well as rail transportation fees from our bakken midstream operating segment the decrease in cost of products sold in 2016 compared to 2015 and in 2015 compared to 2014 principally reflects the decline in crude oil prices cash operating costs cash operating costs consisting of operating costs and expenses production and severance taxes and eampp general and administrative expenses decreased by 194 million in 2016 compared with the prior year 2015 188 million decrease versus 2014 the decrease in 2016 compared to 2015 is due to lower production and ongoing cost reduction efforts and lower production taxes in the bakken operating costs in 2016 include higher workover costs to replace failed subsurface valves in the gulf of mexico the decrease in 2015 compared to 2014 is due to cost reductions across the portfolio and lower production taxes in the bakken which were partially offset by higher operating costs at tubular bells where production commenced in the fourth quarter of 2014 bakken midstream tariffs expense tariffs expense in 2016 increased versus 2015 primarily due to increased oil gathering tariffs and minimum volume deficiency payments related to rail export services in 2016 partially offset by lower gas volumes processed through the tioga gas plant higher tariff expense in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily reflects higher volumes processed through the tioga gas plant which was shut down during the first quarter of 2014 to complete a plant expansion and refurbishment project for 2017 we estimate midstream tariffs

factors for further details    39    critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and revenues and expenses in the statement of consolidated income the accounting methods used can affect net income equity and various financial statement ratios however our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity accounting for exploration and development costs eampp activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage including lease bonuses brokers fees and other related costs are capitalized annual lease rentals exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred costs of drilling and equipping productive wells including development dry holes and related production facilities are capitalized in production operations costs of injected co2 for tertiary recovery are expensed as incurred the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if 1 the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and 2 sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project if either of those criteria is not met or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project the capitalized well costs are charged to expense indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel active negotiations for sales contracts with customers negotiations with governments operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors crude oil and natural gas reserves the determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations in addition government and project operator approvals must be obtained and depending on the amount of the project cost senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project we maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties our technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells performance reviews new technical data and other studies to provide consistency throughout the corporation standard reserve estimation guidelines definitions reporting reviews and approval practices are used the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review we also engage an independent thirdparty consulting firm to audit approximately 80 of our total proved reserves each year proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelvemonth period ending december 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year unless prices are defined by contractual agreements excluding escalations based on future conditions as discussed in item 1a risk factors crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves for example the average wti crude oil price used in the determination of proved reserves at december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 was 4268 5013 and 9442 per barrel respectively the lower prices for 2016 and 2015 relative to 2014 resulted in negative revisions to our proved reserves at december 31 2016 of 29 million boe 2015 234 million boe if crude oil prices in 2017 are at levels below that used in determining 2016 proved reserves we may recognize further negative revisions to our december 31 2016 proved undeveloped reserves in addition we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures conversely price increases in 2017 above those used in determining 2016 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2017 it is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves as of december 31 2017 due to a number of factors that are currently unknown including 2017 crude oil prices any revisions based on 2017 reservoir performance and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices a 10 change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at december 31 2016 would result in an approximate 300 million pretax change in depreciation depletion and amortization expense for 2017 see the supplementary oil and gas data on pages 84 through 94 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves bakken midstream joint venture  on july 1 2015 we sold a 50 interest in hip to gip for net cash consideration of approximately 26 billion we consolidate the activities of hip which qualifies as a variable interest entity vie under us generally accepted accounting principles we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie as defined in the accounting standards since we have the power through our 50 ownership to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of hip and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to hip this conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered hips    40    governance structure the commercial agreements between hip and us and the voting rights established between the members which provide us the ability to control the operations of hip impairment of longlived assets we review longlived assets including oil and gas fields for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered longlived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities if the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded the amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows an income valuation approach or by a marketbased valuation approach which are level 3 fair value measurements in the case of oil and gas fields the present value of future net cash flows is based on managements best estimate of future prices which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a riskadjusted rate the projected production volumes represent reserves including probable reserves expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures the production volumes prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelvemonth average prices  our impairment tests of longlived eampp producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors selling prices operating and capital costs the timing of future production and other factors which are updated each time an impairment test is performed we could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly as a result of the extended period of low crude oil prices we tested our oil and gas properties for impairment see note 6 impairment in the notes to consolidated financial statements impairment of goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually on october 1st or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable based on a twostep process the goodwill test is conducted at a reporting unit level which is defined in accounting standards as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment the reporting unit or units to be used in an evaluation and measurement of goodwill for impairment testing are determined from a number of factors including the manner in which the business is managed prior to the second quarter of 2015 we had one operating segment eampp consisting of two reporting units offshore and onshore which reflected the manner in which performance was assessed by the operating segment manager in the second quarter of 2015 we established a second operating segment bakken midstream which previously was part of the onshore reporting unit prior to the formation of the bakken midstream operating segment the offshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 1098 million while the onshore reporting unit had allocated goodwill of 760 million upon formation of the bakken midstream operating segment we allocated 375 million of goodwill from the onshore reporting unit to the bakken midstream operating segment based on the relative fair values of the bakken midstream business and the remainder of the onshore reporting unit there was no change to the composition of the offshore reporting unit in step one of the impairment test the fair value of a reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform step two to determine possible impairment by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by assuming the reporting unit is purchased at fair value with assets and liabilities of the reporting unit being reflected at fair value in the same manner as the accounting prescribed for a business combination the resulting excess of fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the reporting units assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss would be recorded our fair value estimate of each reporting unit is the sum of the anticipated discounted cash flows of producing assets and known development projects and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings access to new business opportunities enterprise control and increased market share the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves future prices timing of future net cash flows and market premiums we also consider the relative market valuation of similar peer companies and other market data if available in determining fair value of a reporting unit in addition a qualitative reconciliation of our market capitalization to the fair value of the reporting units used in the goodwill impairment test is performed as of the testing date to assess reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values  significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of a reporting unit that could result in failing step one and potentially result in an impairment of goodwill based on the outcome of step two if a reporting unit fails step one it is possible that the implied fair value of goodwill in step two exceeds its carrying value due to one or more assets of the reporting unit having a fair value below its carrying value   41    as there are significant differences in the way longlived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned at the reporting unit level or there could be an impairment of goodwill without a corresponding impairment of an underlying asset in the second quarter of 2015 we performed impairment tests on the offshore and onshore reporting units in accordance with accounting standards for goodwill immediately prior to creation of the bakken midstream operating segment no impairment resulted from this assessment in addition accounting standards require that following a reorganization allocated goodwill should be tested for impairment we also performed impairment tests on the allocated goodwill for the bakken midstream and the onshore reporting unit at june 30 2015 goodwill allocated to the bakken midstream operating segment passed the impairment test but the goodwill allocated to the onshore reporting unit did not pass the impairment test as a result we recorded a noncash pretax charge of 385 million 385 million after income taxes in the second quarter of 2015 to reflect the onshore reporting units goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards  as a result of the decline in crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015 we performed an impairment test at december 31 2015 on the offshore reporting unit and determined its goodwill was impaired we recorded a pretax impairment charge of 1098 million 1098 million after income taxes to reflect the offshore reporting units goodwill at its implied fair value of zero based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation as stipulated in the accounting standards  effective january 1 2017 as part of a reorganization of our eampp business the onshore and offshore reporting units were combined within the eampp operating segment which had no goodwill at december 31 2016 this reorganization had no impact on the composition of the bakken midstream operating segment we expect that the benefits of our remaining goodwill totaling 375 million assigned to the bakken midstream operating segment will be recovered based on market conditions at december 31 2016 income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not that based on the technical merits the position will be sustained upon examination we have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits additionally we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized if when tested under the relevant accounting standards it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized  the accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidences relative objectivity in evaluating potential sources of positive evidence we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods the availability of tax planning strategies the existence of appreciated assets estimates of future taxable income and other factors estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves selling prices and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts in evaluating potential sources of negative evidence we consider a cumulative loss in recent years any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused losses expected in early future years unsettled circumstances that if unfavorably resolved would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years and carryback or carryforward periods that are so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits if a significant deductible temporary difference is expected to reverse in a single year due to a sustained low commodity price environment we experienced a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss as of december 31 2016 a threeyear cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income  as of december 31 2016 the consolidated balance sheet reflects a 5450 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above with 3749 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016 related primarily to the us denmark hydrocarbon tax only and malaysia the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable however could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth we do not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations asset retirement obligations we have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle longlived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations in addition the fair value of any    42    legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated we capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred in subsequent periods the liability is accreted and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset in order to measure these obligations we estimate the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations in determining these estimates we are required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement timing of settlement interpretation of legal requirements inflationary factors and discount rate in addition there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology as a result our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values retirement plans we have funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plans an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan we recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the consolidated balance sheet the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations expected longterm rates of return on plan assets the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality assumptions these assumptions represent estimates made by us some of which can be affected by external factors for example the discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of highquality fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in our financial statements derivatives we utilize derivative instruments including futures forwards options and swaps individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings fair value measurements we use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments including the market and income approaches our fair value measurements also include nonperformance risk and time value of money considerations counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities we also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles these fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations qualifying nonmonetary exchanges the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of longlived assets equity method investments or goodwill we determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level 1 to estimates determined using related market data level 3 including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level 2 when level 1 inputs are available within a particular market those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value however the level of fair value for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy    43    environment health and safety our long term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of

complying with all greenhouse gas ghg emissions mandates and the responsible management of ghg emissions at our facilities we will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation sites where corrective action may be necessary include onshore exploration and production facilities sites from discontinued operations as to which we retained liability and although not currently significant superfund sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party we accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable at december 31 2016 our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately 80 million we expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites our remediation spending was approximately 10 million in 2016 2015 13 million 2014 12 million the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses
