 we along with many companies that have been or continue to be engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline have been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including us the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against us have been settled in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that we and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court in september 2016 the state of rhode island also filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that we and other major oil companies damaged the groundwater in rhode island by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico was settled in conjunction with the bankruptcy courts confirmation of hovensas liquidation plan which is described below the remaining open matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition in september 2003 we received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects us relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey we previously owned we and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination this work remains ongoing we and other parties settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed with epa to fund remediation of a portion of the site in april 2014 the epa issued a focused feasibility study ffs proposing to conduct banktobank dredging of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river at an estimated cost of 17 billion on march 4 2016 the epa issued a record of decision rod in respect of the lower eight miles of the lower passaic river selecting a remedy that includes banktobank dredging at an estimated cost of 138 billion the rod does not address the upper nine miles of the lower passaic river which may require additional remedial action in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given that the epa has not selected a remedy for the entirety of the lower passaic river total remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances we do not believe that this matter will result in a significant liability to us because there are numerous other parties who we expect will share in the cost of remediation and damages and our former terminal did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length  in march 2014 we received an administrative order from epa requiring us and 26 other parties to undertake the remedial design for the remedy selected by the epa for the gowanus canal superfund site in brooklyn new york the remedy includes dredging of surface sediments and the placement of a cap over the deeper sediments throughout the canal and insitu stabilization of certain contaminated sediments that will remain in place below the cap epa has estimated that this remedy will cost 506 million however the ultimate costs that will be incurred in connection with the design and implementation of the remedy remain uncertain our alleged liability derives from our former ownership and operation of a fuel oil terminal adjacent to the canal we indicated to epa that we would comply with the administrative order and are currently contributing funding for the remedial design based on an interim allocation of costs among the parties at the same time we are participating in an allocation process whereby neutral experts selected by the parties will determine the final shares of the remedial design costs to be paid by each of the participants the parties have not yet addressed the allocation of costs associated with implementing the remedy that is currently being designed this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition   18      on january 18 2017 we entered into a consent decree with the north dakota department of health resolving alleged noncompliance with north dakotas air pollution laws and provisions of the federal clean air act pursuant to the consent decree we are required to implement corrective actions including implementation of a leak detection and repair program at most of our existing facilities in north dakota we were assessed a base penalty of 922000 which is subject to adjustment based on the date we complete corrective actions required under the terms of the consent decree we made an initial penalty payment of 55000 during the first quarter of 2017  we periodically receive notices from the epa that we are a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties may be jointly and severally liable for certain sites such as those discussed above the epas claims or assertions of liability against us relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on our business or accounts cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material we are from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters we cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows
