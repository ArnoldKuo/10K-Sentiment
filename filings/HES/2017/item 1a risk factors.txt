 within this document       1  glossary throughout this report the following company or industry specific terms and abbreviations are used appraisal well  an exploration well drilled to confirm the results of a discovery well or a well used to determine the boundaries of a productive formation bbl  one stock tank barrel which is 42 united states gallons liquid volume barrel of oil equivalent or boe  this reflects natural gas reserves converted on the basis of relative energy content of six mcf equals one barrel of oil equivalent one mcf represents one thousand cubic feet barrel of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence as the equivalent price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis has been substantially lower than the corresponding price for crude oil over the recent past see the average selling prices in the table on page 9 boepd  barrels of oil equivalent per day bopd  barrels of oil per day carried interest  an interest in an oil and gas property where the carrying party agrees to pay for all or part of development and operating costs of another party the carrying party may then recover a specified amount of costs from the other partys share of any hydrocarbon revenues condensate  a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure but that when produced is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature development well  a well drilled within the proved area of an oil andor natural gas reservoir with the intent of producing oil andor natural gas from that area of the reservoir dry hole or dry well  exploratory or development well that does not produce oil or gas in commercial quantities exploratory well  a well drilled to find oil or natural gas in an unproved area or find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive by another reservoir field  an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature andor stratigraphic condition fractionation  fractionation is the process by which the mixture of ngls that results from natural gas processing is separated into the ngl components such as ethane propane butane isobutane and natural gasoline prior to their sale to various petrochemical and industrial end users fractionation is accomplished by controlling the temperature of the stream of mixed liquids in order to take advantage of the difference in boiling points of separate products gross acreage  acreage in which a working interest is held by the corporation gross well  a well in which a working interest is held by the corporation mcf  one thousand cubic feet of natural gas mmcfd  one thousand mcf of natural gas per day net acreage or net wells  the sum of the fractional working interests owned by us in gross acres or gross wells ngls or natural gas liquids  naturally occurring substances found in natural gas including ethane butane isobutane propane and natural gasoline that can be collectively removed from produced natural gas separated into these substances and sold natural gas liquids do not sell at prices equivalent

description of our significant eampp operations is as follows united states  our production in the us was from onshore properties principally in the bakken oil shale play in the williston basin of north dakota the utica basin of ohio and the permian basin of texas and from offshore properties in the gulf of mexico onshore bakken  at december 31 2016 we held 577000 net acres in the bakken with varying working interest percentages during 2016 we operated an average of 33 rigs drilled 71 wells completed 92 wells and brought on production 100 wells bringing the total operated production wells to 1272 drilling and completion costs per operated well averaged 48 million in 2016 down 17 from 2015 in 2016 we also increased our standard well design to a 50stage completion from the previous 35stage completion the improved efficiency of our drilling operations can largely be attributed to application of our lean manufacturing capabilities during 2017 we plan to increase our rig count to six rigs from two rigs for an average of 35 rigs to drill approximately 80 wells and to bring approximately 75 wells on production net production for full year 2017 is forecast to be in the range of 95000 boepd to 105000 boepd with the building rig count we expect our bakken production in the fourth quarter of 2017 to average between 105000 boepd and 110000 boepd which would represent an increase of approximately 15 from the first quarter to the fourth quarter utica  we own a 50 working interest in approximately 45000 net acres in the wet gas area of the utica basin of ohio during 2016 a total

continued during 2016 with the completion of a water injection well in 2017 the operator plans to defer further drilling activity tubular bells at this hess operated field we brought online a fifth production well and one water injector well completing the initial drilling campaign three wells were shutin for an extended period in 2016 due to subsurface valve failures these valves have since been replaced and we are pursuing our options to recover damages for these valve failures stampede at this hess operated project in the green canyon area of the gulf of mexico the coowners sanctioned the field development and committed to two deepwater drilling rigs in 2014 in 2016 the topsides deck was installed on the hull and fabrication and precommissioning of the topsides continues according to plan we also completed installation of subsea equipment at both drill centers in the field drilled one development well and commenced drilling on one water injector well first production from the

established an environmental response trust to administer to hovensas remaining environmental obligations and to conduct an orderly winddown of its remaining activities see note 10 hovensa llc in notes to consolidated financial statements competition and market conditions see item 1a risk factors for a discussion of competition and market conditions   12      other items emergency preparedness and response plans and procedures we have in place a series of business and assetspecific emergency preparedness response and business continuity plans that detail procedures for rapid and effective emergency response and environmental mitigation activities these plans are risk appropriate and are maintained reviewed and updated as necessary to confirm their accuracy and suitability where appropriate they are also reviewed and approved by the relevant host government authorities responder training and drills are routinely held worldwide to assess and continually improve the effectiveness of our plans our contractors service providers representatives from government agencies and where applicable joint venture partners participate in the drills to help ensure that emergency procedures are comprehensive and can be effectively implemented to complement internal capabilities and to help ensure coverage for our global operations we maintain membership contracts with a network of local regional and global oil spill response and emergency response organizations at the regional and global level these organizations include clean gulf associates cga marine spill response corporation msrc marine well containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally osrl is a global response organization and is available when needed to assist us anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right the organization maintains business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets include nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom 9 capping stacks and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support we have contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if we were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services we would fund such services and seek reimbursement under our insurance coverage as described below in certain circumstances we pursue and enter into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support we maintain close associations with emergency response organizations through our representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl we continue to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea environments and improve containment and recovery methods the task forces are working closely with the oil and gas industry and international government agencies to implement improvements and increase the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes insurance coverage and indemnification we maintain insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to our property thirdparty liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages the amount of insurance covering physical damage to our property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which we are selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 400 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 400 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 319 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally we carry insurance that provides thirdparty coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to our participating interest our insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable generally our drilling contracts and most of our other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault    13      variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis we are customarily responsible for and indemnify the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from our reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies us for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally we are generally liable for all of our own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severally liable for claims made by thirdparties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several environmental compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general we spent approximately 10 million in 2016 for environmental remediation the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see environment health and safety in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations number of employees at december 31 2016 we had 2304 employees

any violation of the nyses corporate governance standards    14      item 1a risk factors  our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risks including the risk factors described below these risk factors could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins liquidity financial condition and future earnings are highly dependent on the benchmark market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas and our associated realized price differentials which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of opec may exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters may have a significant impact on the oil markets other factors include but are not limited to worldwide and domestic supplies of and demand for crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas political conditions and events including instability changes in governments or armed conflict around the world and in particular in crude oil or natural gas producing regions the cost of exploring for developing and producing crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas the price and availability of alternative fuels or other forms of energy the effect of energy conservation and environmental protection efforts and overall economic conditions globally the sentiment of commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas average prices for 2016 were 4347 per barrel for wti 2015 4876 2014 9291 and 4513 per barrel for brent 2015 5360 2014 9945 in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements we maintain significant bank credit facilities an inability to access renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas and costs of drilling and development activities persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves while increasing drilling and development costs could negatively affect expected economic returns there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in 2015 and to a lesser extent in 2016 resulting in reductions to our reported proved reserves if crude oil prices in 2017 average below prices used to determine proved reserves at december 31 2016 it could have an adverse effect on our estimated proved reserves and the value of our business see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the parties under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our eampp operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest    15      moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all the exploration development and production of crude oil and natural gas involves substantial costs which may not be fully funded from operations for example in 2016 we had a significant net loss and if commodity prices remain low through 2017 we are forecasting a net loss for 2017 two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate our debt have assigned an investment grade rating in february 2016 standard and poors ratings services sampp lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook and moodys investors service moodys lowered our credit rating to ba1 with stable outlook which is below investment grade in december 2016 fitch ratings fitch lowered our investment grade credit rating one notch to bbb with stable outlook in february 2017 sampp reaffirmed our investment grade credit rating of bbb with stable outlook although currently we do not have any borrowings under our longterm credit facility further ratings downgrades continued weakness in the oil and gas industry or negative outcomes within commodity and financial markets could adversely impact our access to capital markets by increasing the costs of financing or by impacting our ability to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all in addition further ratings downgrades may require that we issue letters of credit or provide other forms of collateral under certain contractual requirements any inability to access capital markets could adversely impact our financial adaptability and our ability to execute our strategy and may also expose us to heightened exposure to credit risk political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency geographic territorial border disputes corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly we have material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons and have an adverse effect on our    16      sales volumes revenues and margins the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets could significantly increase the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the thirdparty accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences we are involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel construction delays unfavorable weather conditions and equipment failures this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact our future results of operations and cash flows departures of key members from our senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact our ability to deliver on our strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit us from executing our strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value we are dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the eampp industry as a result we may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact our ability to run our operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences we manage commodity price and other risks through our risk management function but such activities may impede our ability to benefit from commodity price increases and can expose us to similar potential counterparty credit risk as impacts amounts due from the sale of hydrocarbons we may enter into commodity price hedging arrangements to protect us from commodity price declines these arrangements may depending on the instruments used and the level of increases involved limit any potential upside from commodity price increases as with accounts receivable we may be exposed to potential economic loss should a counterparty be unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under the terms of a hedging agreement in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on    17      our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations in addition as technologies evolve and these attacks become more sophisticated we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks
