containment company mwcc wild well control wwc subsea well intervention service swis national response corporation nrc and oil spill response limited osrl cga and msrc are domestic spill response organizations and mwcc provides the equipment and personnel to contain underwater well control incidents in the gulf of mexico wwc provides firefighting well control and engineering services globally nrc and osrl are global response organizations and are available to assist the corporation when needed anywhere in the world in addition to owning response assets in their own right these organizations maintain business relationships that provide immediate access to additional critical response support services if required these owned response assets included nearly 300 recovery and storage vessels and barges more than 250 skimmers over 600000 feet of boom and significant quantities of dispersants and other ancillary equipment including aircraft in addition to external well control and oil spill response support the corporation has contracts with wildlife environmental meteorology incident management medical and security resources if the corporation were to engage these organizations to obtain additional critical response support services it would fund such services and seek reimbursement under its insurance coverage described below in certain circumstances the corporation pursues and enters into mutual aid agreements with other companies and government cooperatives to receive and provide oil spill response equipment and personnel support the corporation maintains close associations with emergency response organizations through its representation on the executive committees of cga and msrc as well as the board of directors of osrl   the corporation continues to participate in a number of industrywide task forces that are studying better ways to assess the risk of and prevent onshore and offshore incidents access and control blowouts in subsea

the effectiveness of oil spill prevention preparedness response and recovery processes   insurance coverage and indemnification   the corporation maintains insurance coverage that includes coverage for physical damage to its property third party liability workers compensation and employers liability general liability sudden and accidental pollution and other coverage this insurance coverage is subject to deductibles exclusions and limitations and there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages   the amount of insurance covering physical damage to the corporations property and liability related to negative environmental effects resulting from a sudden and accidental pollution event excluding atlantic named windstorm coverage for which it is selfinsured varies by asset based on the assets estimated replacement value or the estimated maximum loss in the case of a catastrophic event first party coverage consists of two tiers of insurance the first 300 million of coverage is provided through an industry mutual insurance group above this 300 million threshold insurance is carried which ranges in value up to 253 billion in total depending on the asset coverage level as described above additionally the corporation carries insurance that provides third party coverage for general liability and sudden and accidental pollution up to 108 billion which coverage under a standard joint operating arrangement would be reduced to the corporations participating interest     12    the corporations insurance policies renew at various dates each year future insurance coverage could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions or additional exclusions or limitations in addition some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are deemed economically acceptable   generally the corporations drilling contracts and most of its other offshore services contracts provide for a mutual hold harmless indemnity structure whereby each party to the contract the corporation and contractor indemnifies the other party for injuries or damages to their personnel and property and often those of its contractorssubcontractors regardless of fault variations may include indemnity exclusions to the extent a claim is attributable to the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of a party thirdparty claims on the other hand are generally allocated on a fault basis   the corporation is customarily responsible for and indemnifies the contractor against all claims including those from thirdparties to the extent attributable to pollution or contamination by substances originating from its reservoirs or other property regardless of cause including gross negligence and willful misconduct and the contractor is responsible for and indemnifies the corporation for all claims attributable to pollution emanating from the contractors property additionally the corporation is generally liable for all of its own losses and most thirdparty claims associated with catastrophic losses such as damage to reservoirs blowouts cratering and loss of hole regardless of cause although exceptions for losses attributable to gross negligence andor willful misconduct do exist lastly some offshore services contracts include overall limitations of the contractors liability equal to the value of the contract or a fixed amount   under a standard joint operating agreement joa each party is liable for all claims arising under the joa to the extent of its participating interest operator or nonoperator variations include indemnity exclusions when the claim is based upon the gross negligence andor willful misconduct of the operator in which case the operator is solely liable the parties to the joa may continue to be jointly and severably liable for claims made by third parties in some jurisdictions further under some production sharing contracts between a governmental entity and commercial parties liability of the commercial parties to the government entity is joint and several   environmental   compliance with various existing environmental and pollution control regulations imposed by federal state local and foreign governments is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the corporations financial condition or results of operations but increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general the corporation spent approximately 12 million in 2014 for environmental remediation principally relating to the downstream businesses the level of other expenditures to comply with federal state local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of the corporations capital expenditures and operating expenses for further discussion of environmental matters see the environment health and safety section of item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   number of employees   the number of persons employed by the corporation was approximately 3045 at december 31 2014 and

operations   our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors including those described below the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations financial condition liquidity and results of operations and as a result holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments it is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future   our business and operating results are highly dependent on the market prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which can be very volatile our estimated proved reserves revenue operating cash flows operating margins and future earnings are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas which are volatile and influenced by numerous factors beyond our control the major foreign oil producing countries including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets in the fourth quarter of 2014 prices for brent crude oil and west texas intermediate crude oil declined by approximately 40 to end the year at 57 per barrel and 53 per barrel respectively if crude oil prices remain at these levels for the remainder of 2015 there will be a significant decrease in 2015 revenues and earnings from 2014 levels we cannot predict how long these lower price levels will continue to prevail the commodities trading markets as well as other supply and demand factors may also influence the selling prices of crude oil natural gas liquids and natural gas to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts in order to manage the potential volatility of cash flows and credit requirements the corporation maintains significant bank credit facilities an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities or access other sources of funding as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity in addition we are exposed to risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values and may engage in hedging activities to mitigate related volatility   if we fail to successfully increase our reserves our future crude oil and natural gas production will be adversely impacted we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time replacement of oil and gas production and reserves including proved undeveloped reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling development activities and enhanced recovery programs therefore future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions irregularities in pressure or formations equipment failure blowouts and weather interruptions future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition similar risks however may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others in addition to the technical risks to reserve replacement replacing reserves and developing future production is also influenced by the price of crude oil and natural gas persistent lower crude oil and natural gas prices such as those currently prevailing may have the effect of reducing capital available for exploration and development activity and may render certain development projects uneconomic or delay their completion and may result in negative revisions to existing reserves   there are inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and discounted future net cash flows and actual quantities may be lower than estimated numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves actual future production oil and gas prices revenues taxes capital expenditures operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities of our proved reserves and the related future net revenues in addition reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward changes based on production performance purchases or sales of properties results of future development prevailing oil and gas prices production sharing contracts which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase and other factors crude oil prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2014 see crude oil and natural gas reserves in critical accounting policies and estimates in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations   we do not always control decisions made under joint operating agreements and the partners under such agreements may fail to meet their obligations we conduct many of our exploration and production operations through joint operating agreements with other parties under which we may not control decisions either because we do not have a controlling interest or are not operator under the agreement there is risk that these parties may at any time have economic    14    business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours and therefore decisions may be made which are not what we believe is in our best interest moreover parties to these agreements may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone in either case the value of our investment may be adversely affected   we are subject to changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions that can significantly and adversely affect our business federal state local territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims disallowance of tax credits and deductions expropriation or nationalization of property mandatory government participation cancellation or amendment of contract rights imposition of capital controls or blocking of funds changes in import and export regulations limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities antibribery or anticorruption laws as well as other political developments may affect our operations we transport some of our crude oil production particularly from the bakken shale oil play by rail recent rail accidents have raised public awareness of rail safety and resulted in heightened regulatory scrutiny we own our own fleet of tank cars that exceed the current federal standards for construction and safety we expect that in 2015 the department of transportation will issue new standards for tank car design which may require us to retrofit our existing tank cars depending on the requirements of the regulation changes in tank car design and limitations on the availability of shop capacity to undertake retrofits as well as other possible regulations aimed at increasing rail safety may lead to a significant increase in the costs of transporting crude oil and other hydrocarbons by rail and otherwise adversely affect our operations    political instability in areas where we operate can adversely affect our business some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate are politically less stable than other areas and partners and may be subject to civil unrest conflict insurgency corruption security risks and labor unrest political and civil unrest in north africa and the middle east has affected and may affect our operations in these areas as well as oil and gas markets generally the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry   our oil and gas operations are subject to environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities our oil and gas operations like those of the industry are subject to environmental risks such as oil spills produced water spills gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage our operations are also subject to numerous us federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative civil or criminal penalties remedial cleanups and natural resource damages or other liabilities in addition increasingly stringent environmental regulations have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general similarly the corporation has material legal obligations to dismantle remove and abandon production facilities and wells that will occur many years in the future in most cases these estimates may be impacted by future changes in regulations and other uncertainties   concerns have been raised in certain jurisdictions where we have operations concerning the safety and environmental impact of the drilling and development of shale oil and gas resources particularly hydraulic fracturing water usage flaring of associated natural gas and air emissions while we believe that these operations can be conducted safely and with minimal impact on the environment regulatory bodies are responding to these concerns and may impose moratoriums and new regulations on such drilling operations that would likely have the effect of prohibiting or delaying such operations and increasing their cost   climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures reduced demand for our products and adversely affect our business we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications operational changes taxes or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs in addition our production is used to produce petroleum fuels which through normal customer use may result in the emission of greenhouse gases regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of crude oil and other hydrocarbons the imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and significantly reduce the value of our business    our industry is highly competitive and many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas many competitors    15    including national oil companies are larger and have substantially greater resources we are also in competition with producers of other forms of energy increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquiring oil and gas assets in addition competition for drilling services technical expertise and equipment may affect the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs resulting in increased capital and operating costs   catastrophic events whether naturally occurring or manmade may materially affect our operations and financial conditions our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which have affected us from time to time and which may damage or destroy assets interrupt operations and have other significant adverse effects examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes fires explosions blowouts such as the third party accident at the macondo prospect pipeline interruptions and ruptures severe weather geological events labor disputes or cyberattacks although we maintain insurance coverage against property and casualty losses there can be no assurance that such insurance will adequately protect the corporation against liability from all potential consequences and damages moreover some forms of insurance may be unavailable in the future or be available only on terms that are deemed economically unacceptable   significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with development projects may result in material negative economic consequences the corporation is involved in several large development projects and the completion of those projects may be delayed beyond what was originally anticipated such examples include but are not limited to delays in receiving necessary approvals from project members or regulatory agencies timely access to necessary equipment availability of necessary personnel and unfavorable weather conditions this may lead to delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events these delays could impact information detailed in forwardlooking statements and may have material negative economic consequences   departures of key members from the corporations senior management team andor difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel could negatively impact the corporations ability to deliver its strategic goals the derivation and monitoring of successful strategies and related policies may be negatively impacted by the departure of key members of senior management moreover an inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of experienced technical and professional personnel in the necessary locations may prohibit the corporation from executing its strategy in full or in part with a commensurate impact on shareholder value   the corporation is dependent on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor an inability or significant delay in securing these services or a high cost thereof may result in material negative economic consequences the availability and cost of drilling rigs equipment supplies and skilled labor will fluctuate over time given the cyclical nature of the exploration and production industry as a result the corporation may encounter difficulties in obtaining required services or could face an increase in cost these consequences may impact the ability of the corporation to run its operations and to deliver projects on time with the potential for material negative economic consequences   cyberattacks targeting computer telecommunications systems and infrastructure used by the oil and gas industry may materially impact our business and operations computers and telecommunication systems are used to conduct our exploration development and production activities and have become an integral part of our business we use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners cyberattacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information in addition computers control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market a cyberattack against these operating systems or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely could damage critical production distribution andor storage assets delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions as a result a cyberattack could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations we routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches disruptions or loss of business critical information our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations   16    item 3 legal proceedings   the corporation along with many companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline a series of similar lawsuits many involving water utilities or governmental entities were filed in jurisdictions across the us against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe including the corporation the principal allegation in all cases was that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe the majority of the cases asserted against the corporation have been settled in 2014 the corporation settled and paid claims against it arising out of an action brought by the state of new jersey for approximately 35 million the settlement was approved by the trial judge and the corporation paid the settlement amount in december 2014 in june 2014 the commonwealth of pennsylvania and the state of vermont each filed independent lawsuits alleging that the corporation and all major oil companies with operations in each respective state have damaged the groundwater in those states by introducing thereto gasoline with mtbe the pennsylvania suit has been removed to federal court and has been forwarded to the existing mtbe multidistrict litigation pending in the southern district of new york the suit filed in vermont is proceeding there in a state court an action brought by the commonwealth of puerto rico also remained unresolved at december 31 2014 the corporation has recorded reserves for its estimated liabilities for its unresolved mtbe lawsuits   the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and the njdep is also seeking natural resource damages the directive insofar as it affects the corporation relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark new jersey previously owned by the corporation the corporation and over 70 companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the environmental protection agency epa to study the same contamination the corporation and other parties recently settled a cost recovery claim by the state of new jersey and also agreed to fund remediation of a portion of the site the epa is continuing to study contamination and remedial designs for other portions of the river in addition the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river given the ongoing studies remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time based on currently known facts and circumstances the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in a material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the rivers length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages   on july 25 2011 the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources commenced an enforcement action against hovensa by issuance of documents titled notice of violation order for corrective action notice of assessment of civil penalty notice of opportunity for hearing the novs the novs assert violations of virgin islands air pollution control laws and regulations arising out of odor incidents on st croix in may 2011 and proposed total penalties of 210000 hovensa believes that it has good defenses against the asserted violations   in july 2004 hovic and hovensa each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees advising of the trustees intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa refinery which had been operated by hovic until october 1998 an action was filed on may 5 2005 in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources in 2014 hovic hovensa and the government of the us virgin islands entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which hovensa paid 35 million and agreed to pay the government of the us virgin islands an additional 40 million no later than december 31 2014 hovensa was unable to make this additional payment because the usvirgin islands legislature did not approve a proposed operating agreement required to complete a proposed sale of hovensa which would have provided funds to make the settlement payment under the terms of the settlement agreement the us virgin islands government was granted a first lien on hovensas assets to secure the settlement payment and in january 2015 the government commenced a foreclosure action to enforce this lien hovensa intends to defend this action and may take other steps in response to the action including the sale of assets andor the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition   in february 2015 the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc issued a notice of determination to terminate the hovensa pension plan hovensa had been in negotiations with the pbgc to make additional contributions to the plan    17    with proceeds from a proposed sale of hovensa which was not completed for the reasons described above the registrant does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition   the corporation periodically receives notices from the epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites under this legislation all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable for certain sites the epas claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed with respect to the remaining sites the epas claims have been settled or a proposed settlement is under consideration in all cases for amounts that are not material the ultimate impact of these proceedings and of any related proceedings by private parties on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of cleanup cost estimates but is not expected to be material   the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings including proceedings relating to other environmental matters the corporation cannot predict with certainty if how or when such proceedings will be resolved or what the eventual relief if any may be particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages numerous issues may need to be resolved including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding subject to the foregoing in managements opinion based upon currently known facts and circumstances the outcome of such proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of the corporation
