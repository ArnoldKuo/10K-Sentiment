statutory and 10indexregulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions a change in applicable statutes regulations or regulatory or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our businessrules and regulations resulting from the doddfrank actin july 2010 the us government enacted sweeping changes to the supervision and regulation of the financial industry through the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act the doddfrank act requires us federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings studies and reports these regulatory agencies include the commodity futures trading commission the securities and exchange commission the sec the fed the occ the fdic the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately however the details of some provisions are subject to implementing regulations furthermore some provisions of the doddfrank act are still subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years as a result of the doddfrank act and other regulatory reforms we are experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and supervision these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux as a result we cannot specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations see item 1a risk factors within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations below we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the doddfrank actfdic assessment ratessince rj bank provides deposits covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is subject to the federal deposit insurance act in february 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment base for banks with greater than 10 billion in

fdics exposure should the bank fail this new rule became effective for rj bank beginning with the december 2013 assessment period cfpb oversightin july 2011 the cfpb began operations and was given

reporting act v fair debt collection act vi consumer financial privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices under section 1031 of the doddfrank act beginning with fiscal year 2014 the cfpb assumed supervisory authority over rj bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has authority to promulgate regulations issue orders draft policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions the creation of the cfpb has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws to the extent that as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight we become the subject of any enforcement activity we may be required to pay fines incur penalties or engage in certain remediation effortsstress testsin october 2012 the fed fdic and occ jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies state member banks and savings and loan companies with total assets between

companies and their affiliates together banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund covered funds banking entities engaged in proprietary trading andor investments in covered funds must establish a volcker rulespecific compliance program we have adopted a program which is designed to be effective in ensuring compliance with the volcker rule however in connection with their examinations regulators will assess the sufficiency and adequacy of our program the volcker rule also limits investments in and relationships with covered funds the conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds has been extended and banking entities may still apply for an additional fiveyear extension with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds we maintain a number of private equity investments some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the volcker rule the extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and implement any additional actions necessary for conformance with the rule to the extent that any of our covered funds satisfy the feds criteria for further extension for certain illiquid funds we may apply for such extensions although there is no assurance that any such extension would be grantedbasel iii and us capital rulesboth rjf as a bank holding company and rj bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to recent regulatory actions in july 2013 the occ the fed and the fdic released final us rules implementing the basel iii capital framework developed by the basel committee on banking supervision and certain

the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information regarding rjf and rj bank regulatory capital levels and ratios including information regarding the capital conservation buffer the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this report for more informationfailure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary and in certain cases mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of rjf and rj bank under capital adequacy guidelines rjf and rj bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classification for rjf and rj bank are also subject to the qualitative judgments of us regulators based on components of capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by federal banking regulations to ensure capital adequacy require that rjf as a financial holding company and rj bank maintain minimum amounts and ratios of i common equity tier 1 or cet1 tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets ii tier 1 capital to average assets and iii capital conservation buffers see item 7 regulatory in this report and note 25 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further informationmoney market fundsin july 2014 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds the amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds while preserving the benefits of the funds we do not sponsor any money market funds we utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes as well as to offer our clients with money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternativesmunicipal advisor regulationin september 2013 the sec issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors as required under the doddfrank act these final rules for municipal advisors which became effective in july 2014 i impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities ii may result in the need for new written representations by issuers and iii may limit the manner in which we in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles interact with municipal issuers our municipal finance business became subject to additional regulation and oversight by the sec by virtue of our registration with the sec as a municipal advisor in 2014 in august 2014 the sec also announced that it will undertake a twoyear review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative 12indexmoreover in december 2015 the municipal securities rulemaking board the msrb received approval from the sec on new msrb rule g42 regarding duties of nonsolicitor municipal advisors and related amendments to msrb rule g8 regarding books and records to be made by municipal advisors among others all of which became effective in june 2016 additional rulemaking by the msrb may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local governments are able to interact with outside finance professionals these new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients as well as potentially have a negative shortterm impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape however we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations which are included in our capital markets segment fiduciary duty standardpursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors the sec has not yet proposed rules relating to a new standard of conduct applicable to brokerdealers however in april 2016 the us department of labor the dol issued its final regulation the dol rule expanding the definition of who is deemed an investment advice fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa as a result of giving investment advice to a plan plan participant or beneficiary as well as under the internal revenue code for individual retirement arrangements iras and nonerisa plans collectively qualified plans as a result of adopting a new definition of fiduciary under erisa the final rule extends fiduciary status to many investment professionals that have not been considered fiduciaries under current law a fiduciary is subject to strict duties to act solely in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is personally liable to the erisa plan for breaches in its discharge of its duties the dol rule also contains exemptions including the best interest contract exemption the bic exemption and principal transactions in certain assets exemption the principal transactions exemption designed to enable investment professionals that will become fiduciaries to continue to operate under existing business models that would otherwise be prohibited subject to compliance with new conditions in order to rely on these exemptions we will be required to i act under defined impartial conduct standards that are in the best interest of our client ii adopt certain anticonflict policies and procedures iii provide disclosure of certain information relating to fees compensation and defined material conflicts of interest iv provide a written acknowledgment of fiduciary status and v for iras and nonerisa plans enter into an enforceable contract with our client that contains extensive warranties and does not allow exculpatory provisions waiving the clients rights and remedies including the right to participate in a class action in court the dol rule became effective as of june 7 2016 with phasein of the fiduciary definition not applicable until april 10 2017 and further transition periods until january 1 2018 applying to both the bic exemption and principal transactions exemptionwe are evaluating the impact of the dol rule on our business however because qualified accounts particularly ira accounts comprise a significant portion of our business we expect that compliance with the dol rule and reliance on the bic exemption and the principal transactions exemption will require us to incur increased legal compliance and information technology costs in addition as discussed above we may face enhanced legal risksincentivebased compensation arrangementspursuant to the doddfrank act six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions the agencies have released a proposed rule that would prohibit certain forms of incentivebased compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than 1 billion in total assets the incentivebased compensation proposal much of the incentivebased compensation proposal would apply to financial institutions categorized as either level 1 institutions assets of 250 billion or more or level 2 institutions assets of 50 billion to 250 billion while level 3 institutions assets of 1 billion to 50 billion would be subject to less extensive obligations all covered financial institutions would be required to among other requirements i annually document the structure of their incentivebased compensation arrangements ii retain records of such annual documentation for at least seven years and iii comply with general prohibitions on incentivebased compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risktaking should the incentivebased compensation proposal be adopted we would be subject to the rules requirements as a level 3 financial institution which would require us to incur additional legal and compliance costs as well as subject us to increased legal risks13indexother regulations applicable to our

prospectsrisks related to our business and industrydamage to our reputation could damage our businessesmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients customers investors and associates if we fail to address or appear to fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues money laundering cybersecurity and privacy recordkeeping and sales and trading practices the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in our products failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and reputational harm further negative publicity about us whether or not true may also harm our future business prospects we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities including oil and gas consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy for example fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits 16indexat times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low economic output levels artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high unemployment rates and significant uncertainty with respect to domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy these conditions led to changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while global financial markets have shown signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of shortterm interest rates a return to increased credit market dislocations reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from lower trading volumes a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from capital markets and advisory transactions due to reduced activity increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited  us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the middle east and in eastern europe and russia concerns about the european union eu including britains june 23 2016 referendum to exit the eu brexit and the stability of the eus sovereign debt has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the eus financial support programs it is possible that other eu member states may experience financial troubles in the future or may choose to follow britains lead and leave the eu any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity us state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america market conditions in the united states and canada can be assessed through the following metrics the level and volatility of interest rates the unemployment and underemployment rates real estate prices consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earningslack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionwe must maintain appropriate liquidity levels our inability to maintain adequate liquidity and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors sell assets at unfavorable prices and cut or eliminate dividend payments our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings regulatory changes to the liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for rjf and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parentthe availability of financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on various factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties as well as the stability of markets generally see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk17indexa downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations earnings and financial conditionif our credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our client relationships such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information a credit rating downgrade would also result in rjf incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its 300 million revolving credit facility executed on august 6 2015 in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information on this revolving credit facilitywe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilitymarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and private equity investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuerin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidityour venture capital and private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market riskwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes including bankruptcy lack of liquidity or operational failure among others we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers market making and underwriting businesses which exposes us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold 18indexcertain securities loans and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase andor resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit and margin and other loans collateralized by securities we incur credit risk through our investments our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries or geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics acts of terrorism severe weather events or other adverse economic events could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit riskthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us 19indexcannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and advisory feesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management aum aum balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting marketmaking trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition despite risk mitigation policies we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activitiesfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments we may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we cannot sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashwe continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilitywe continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginswe face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels and location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the 20indexfinancial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms and hedge funds among others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services the inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology including improvements made to internet connectivity networking and telecommunications systemsour ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals particularly our managing directors and the members of our executive committees as well as employees and financial advisors to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidityturnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenuesmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may work for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining usbusiness growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risksintegrating acquired businesses including for example the september 6 2016 acquisition of the us private client services unit of deutsche bank wealth management alex brown and the august 31 2016 acquisition of macdougall macdougall amp mactier inc 3macs as well as providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses recruiting financial advisors or making strategic acquisitions or investments our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growthexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction 21indexmoreover to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms we may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise capital or borrow in order to finance an acquisition which could result in dilution or increased leverage we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all a continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize could be materially adverse to our businessour businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standardsour continued success depends in part upon our ability to i successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ii address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and iii retain skilled information technology employees failure of our technology systems which could result from events beyond our control or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational riskssecurity breaches of our technology systems or those of our clients or other thirdparty vendors we rely on could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputationthe expectations of sound operational and informational security practices have risen among our clients and vendors the public at large and regulators our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions cyberattacks and breakdowns our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations notwithstanding the precautions we take if one or more of these events were to occur this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain including that of our clients and counterparties which is processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients and counterparties we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications we may also be subject to litigation and financial losses that are neither insured nor covered under any of our current insurance policies a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulatorsin providing services to clients we may manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or

regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risksassociate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harmthere have been a number of highlypublicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients if our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditionscertain of our principal operations are located in st petersburg florida while we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data

pertaining thereto rjf is relying on regions to continue to fulfill its indemnification obligations under the spa with respect to such matters our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions in the future or our failure to recover future losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified could result in our incurring significant costs for defense settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and our regulatory capital levelssee note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding the indemnification from regionswe are exposed to litigation risks which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospectsmany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability our private client group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related 23indexto the suitability of our investment recommendations the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operationssee item 3 legal proceedings in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal riskthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective and consequently based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the financial accounting standards board the fasb and the sec have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 in this report and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10kin june 2016 the fasb issued a new standard on accounting for credit losses the new standard will replace multiple existing impairment models including the replacement of the incurred loss model for loans with an expected loss model we are evaluating the potential impact its adoption which will occur no later than the quarter ended december 31 2020 will have on our financial position and results of operations our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and 24indexthe judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to manage our growth adequately or to manage our risk effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest which are under growing scrutiny by us federal and state regulators our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities a perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this reportwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability less established regulatory regimes changes in governmental or central bank policies downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative economic and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations and our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from trading nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the abovementioned factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly those in emerging markets are generally smaller and less developed less liquid and more volatile than us trading marketswe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion of employeerelated health care benefits plans we fund while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our businessrisks related to our regulatory environmentfinancial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actionsfinancial services firms have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment which will become even more stringent in light of recent wellpublicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from various regulators including the sec the fed the occ and the cfpb in addition to stock exchanges finra and state attorneys general penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws rules and regulations each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services including but not limited to the authority to fine us and to grant cancel restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses or engage in certain activities substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could harm our business prospects through adverse financial effects and reputational harm25indexchanges in regulations resulting from the doddfrank act the dol rules including the new fiduciary standard or any new regulations or laws may adversely affect our businessesmarket and economic conditions over the past several years have directly led to a demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the united states and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry see item 1 regulation in this report for a discussion of such changes the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act and implementing regulations will have on us the financial industry and the economy at large cannot be quantified until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented nevertheless it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of our assets require us to alter at least some of our business practices impose additional compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our businessesthe doddfrank act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our businesses include the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies restrictions on proprietary trading and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the doddfrank act which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has had an active enforcement agenda and any action taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make such products and services less attractive impose additional compliance measures or result in fines penalties or required remediation to the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us we were required to comply with the volcker rules provisions beginning on july 21 2015 although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading due to our underwriting and market making activities the volcker rule will likely adversely affect our results of operations through increased operational and compliance costs possible reductions in our trading revenues and changes to our private equity investmentswe are evaluating the impact of the dol rule on our business however because qualified accounts particularly ira accounts comprise a significant portion of our business we expect that implementation of the dol rule will negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance legal and information technology in addition we expect that our legal risks will increase in part as a result of the new contractual rights required to be given to ira and nonerisa plan clients under the bic exemption and principal transactions exemptionthe basel iii regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitabilityin july 2013 the fed the occ and the fdic released final us basel iii rules which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the us basel iii rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets we became subject to the requirements under the final us basel iii rules as of january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for several of its provisions including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions the increased capital requirements stipulated under the us basel iii rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected we continue to evaluate the impact of the us basel iii rules on both rj bank and rjffailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the united states and accordingly must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classification for both rjf and rj bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by u s federal regulators based on components of our capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by 26indexregulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity tier 1 tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers as defined in the regulations failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and potentially additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and financial condition as more fully discussed in item 1 regulation in this report rjf is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the fed while we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capitalwe are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and finras net capital rule which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds in addition our canadabased brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by iiroc regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that rjf

safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts recordkeeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees any violation of these

which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operationsas a financial holding company we are regulated by the fed rj bank is regulated by the occ the fed the cfpb and the fdic this oversight includes but is not limited to scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has resulted in increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by us regulators that oversee the financial services industry could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes to federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 27indexregulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by rjf and its subsidiaries in addition from time to time rjf and its affiliates may become subject to additional findings with respect to compliance or other regulatory deficiencies which could subject us to additional liability including penalties see item 1 regulation in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to the asset management business may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our businessthe sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the 1940 act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares the staff of the secs office of compliance inspections and examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to subtransfer agents and subadministrators for services that may be deemed to be distributionrelated any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry their impact cannot be fully ascertained at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds investment advisors and brokerdealers as some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the sec increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities it is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business for example pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for brokerdealers however any such standard if mandated would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliancein addition us and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry and may continue to take further actions including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries for example several states and municipalities in the united states have adopted paytoplay rules which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees such paytoplay rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business additionally the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research including external research paid for with soft dollars this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as thirdparty provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars is limited we may have to bear some of these additional costs furthermore new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs for example many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund business or other businesses and changes to the laws rules and regulations in the united states related to the overthecounter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration recordkeeping and reporting obligationsrj bank is subject to the community reinvestment act and fair

turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2016 compared with the year ended september 30 2015  we achieved net revenues of 54 billion a 203 million or 4 increase over the prior year our net income of 529 million reflects an increase of 27 million or 5 and our diluted earnings per share for the current year amount to 365 a 6 increase the current year diluted earnings per share benefited from our repurchase of common stock in open market transactions total client assets under administration increased to 6044 billion at september 30 2016 a 26 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to our acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs strong financial advisor recruiting results high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors and an increase in u s equity markets over the yearafter excluding the acquisitionrelated expenses we incurred during the current year our nongaap adjusted net income amounts to 556 million1 an increase of 11 over the prior year nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts to 3841 an increase of 12 over the 343 diluted earnings per share in the prior yearnet revenues increased in each of our four operating segments our nonoperating other segment reflects a decline in net revenues as the prior year experienced higher valuation gains from our private equity investments than the current year as well as realized gains on sales of ars noninterest expenses have increased 202 million or 5 the increase primarily results from increases in compensation commissions and benefits due to annual raises growth in related commission and fee revenues and increases in benefits expenses increases in communications and information processing expenses resulting from our continued investment in our pcg platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems an increase in the bank loan loss provision resulting from loan growth and an increase associated with the credit deterioration of certain loans in the energy sector and increases in other expenses predominately due to increases in certain legal and regulatory expensesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 362 billion a 3 increase while pretax income decreased by 2 million to 341 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in account and service fee income most notably an increase in fees associated with our multibank client cash sweep program resulting from both an increase in shortterm interest rates and an increase in client cash balances resulting from clients reaction to market volatility and uncertainty securities commissions and fee revenues increased 1 overall fees arising from feebased accounts as well as commissions on fixed income products increased substantially more than offsetting declines in commissions on mutual funds equity securities and new issue sales credits noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior year level most significantly due to higher administrative expenses to support our continued growth higher communications and information technology expenses resulting from our continued investments in our platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems and an increase in other expense predominately due to certain legal and regulatory expenses the segments margin on net revenues decreased to 94 from 98 1adjusted net

nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures35indexthe capital markets segment generated net revenues of 1 billion a 4 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 30 to 139 million the increase in revenues is driven by an increase in trading profits sales commissions on fixed income products and to a lesser extent an increase in tax credit fund syndication fee revenues offset by declines in equity underwriting fee and merger and acquisition and advisory fee revenues noninterest expenses increased a modest 1 over the prior year level our asset management segment generated net revenues of 404 million a 3 increase while pretax income decreased 3 million or 2 to 132 million nondiscretionary assetbased administration fee revenues increased driven by an increase in assets held in these programs over the prior year level advisory fee revenues from managed programs approximate the prior year despite the increase in balances of financial assets under management in managed programs as of fiscal year end due to the volatility of markets during the year and the timing of our fee computations expenses have increased 6 over the prior year level due in large part to a prior year reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year which did not recur in the current yearrj bank generated net revenues of 494 million a 19 increase while pretax income increased 59 million or 21 to 337 million the loan loss provision increased nearly 5 million or 20 over the prior year level due to higher corporate loan growth charges during the current year resulting from loans outstanding within the energy sector and additional provision for corporate loan downgrades noninterest expenses excluding provision for loan losses increased 16 million or 15 primarily due to an increase in the affiliate deposit account servicing fees paid to the private client group resulting from an increase in balances and an increase in fdic insurance premiumsactivities in our other segment reflect a pretax loss that is 84 million or 129 more than the prior year total revenues in the segment decreased 21 million or 31 primarily resulting from a decrease in private equity valuation gains and a decrease of 11 million in gains on the sale of certain ars securities resulting from prior year sales that did not recur in the current year offset by increased interest revenue and foreign exchange gains acquisitionrelated expenses of 41 million are reflected in this segment which did not occur in the prior year these expenses result from our incremental acquisitionrelated expenses for our acquisitions of alex brown 3macs and mummertour effective tax rate was 339 in fiscal year 2016 down from the 371 in the prior year the reduction in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year was due to the following factors 1 as a result of the fiscal year 2016 increase in equity market values compared to fiscal year 2015 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses arising from the value of our companyowned life insurance portfolio had the effect of decreasing our effective tax rate by 15 compared to the prior year 2 adjustments associated with planned divestitures of our remaining businesses in south america accounted for an effective rate decrease of 11 3 we settled significant state tax audits during the year which reduced our effective rate by 04 and 4 we were able to generate and utilize additional lowincome housing tax credits to apply against our tax liability which had a favorable 05 impact on our effective tax ratewe repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year for a total purchase price of approximately 1445 million reflecting an average per share repurchase price of 4569 see part ii item 5 in this report for additional information on these share repurchases the current year diluted earnings per share benefited by 005 as a result of these repurchases consistent with our growth strategies we completed three acquisitions during the year  alex brown 3macs and mummert we continue to evaluate future opportunities but remain committed to our strategy that acquisitions must meet our strategic growth objectives involve entities that share our culture of conservatism and clientfirst values and be executed at purchase prices that provide us opportunities to increase our shareholders valuethe number and significance of possible regulatory changes that impact the businesses in which we operate continues to grow and evolve in april 2016 the dol issued its final regulation expanding the definition of who is deemed an investment advice

compared with the year ended september 30 2014we achieved net revenues of 52 billion in fiscal year 2015 a 339 million or 7 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved net revenue increases total client assets under administration increased to 480 billion at september 30 2015 a 1 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to strong 36indexfinancial advisor recruiting results and high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors which more than offset the decline in the us equity markets for the year primarily occurring in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2015we achieved net income in fiscal year 2015 of 502 million an increase of 22 million or 5 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved increased profitability in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level fully diluted earnings per share of 343 increased 011 or 3 over the prior year amount noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 278 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increased revenues in addition as a result of various growth strategies across our businesses in fiscal year 2015 we experienced an increase in our business development expenses our strategic efforts during fiscal year 2015 to continually improve the technology available to our financial advisors as well as the additional costs of compliance with various new rules and regulations impacting our industry are factors impacting an increase in our communications and information processing expenses the provision for loan losses increased significantly in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year as fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the combination of the above noted factors even after consideration of the incremental expenses resulting from activities associated with the strategic growth initiatives that should favorably impact future revenues resulted in a pretax margin on net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 153 a level that is nearly equivalent to the 154 pretax margin on net revenues in the prior yeara summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal 2015 as compared to the fiscal year 2014 are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 35 billion a 228 million or 7 increase over the prior year pretax income amounted to 342 million a 12 million or 4 increase over the prior year the increase in revenues in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues client assets under administration of the private client group increased 1 over the prior year level to 4533 billion at september 30 2015 the increase in fiscal year 2015 commission revenues and client assets have resulted primarily from successful recruiting of financial advisors and high levels of financial advisor retention financial advisor recruiting in fiscal year 2015 was strong with a net increase of 331 financial advisors over the year to 6596 affiliated financial advisors as of september 30 2015 there was an overall net increase in client assets despite the impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions commission expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased in proportion to the increase in commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased 5 as we incurred increases in certain costs associated with the successful recruiting efforts and continued information system improvements on july 31 2015 we completed our acquisition of the producers choice llc tpc a private insurance and annuity marketing organization based in troy michigan our acquisition of tpc brings more life insurance and annuity experts to the firm to support financial advisors and their clientsthe capital markets segment generated fiscal year 2015 net revenues of 960 million a 7 million or 1 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 107 million a decrease of 24 million or 18 compared to the prior year fiscal year 2015 reflected increases over the prior year in merger and acquisition fees and tax credit fund syndication fees commission revenues from fixed income institutional sales increased in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level resulting in part from growth in our public finance activities however equity underwriting revenues declined compared to the prior year as a result of weakness in both the energy and real estate sectors which also led to a decline in commission revenues on equity products in fiscal year 2015 the net profit generated by this segment in fiscal year 2015 was negatively impacted by increased costs some of which result from our efforts during the year to broadly build out certain sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in certain sectors which we believe present solid longterm opportunities for future revenue growth the continued difficult market environment in canada in fiscal year 2015 negatively impacted this segments revenues and profitabilityour asset management segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 392 million a 23 million or 6 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 135 million a 7 million or 5 increase over the prior year financial assets under management increased 1 from the prior year to 652 billion as of september 30 2015 the increase resulted from net inflows of client assets which more than offset the unfavorable impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions on april 30 2015 we completed our acquisition of cougar global investments limited cougar an asset 37indexmanagement firm based in toronto canada that markets its investment services to high net worth individuals families foundations trusts and institutions in canada and the united statesrj bank generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 414 million a 63 million or 18 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 279 million a 36 million or 15 increase over the prior year net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding coupled with a modest increase in net interest margin in fiscal year 2015 our provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 increased 10 million or 74 compared to the prior year we incurred substantial provision for loan losses associated with loan growth in both years however the majority of the yearoveryear increase resulted from the prior year benefiting to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the credit characteristics of the loan portfolio generally improved over the year reflecting the positive impact of improved economic conditions activities in our other segment in fiscal year 2015 resulted in a pretax loss that was 19 million less than the prior year net revenues in this segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 25 million resulting from increases in revenues associated with our private equity portfolio investments and an increase in gains resulting from our auction rate securities portfolio sales and redemption activities as a result of the fiscal year 2015 increase in private equity investment revenues the portion of this segments pretax income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests also increasedour fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate was 371 up from the 358 in the prior year as a result of the fiscal year 2015 decline in equity market values compared to positive markets in fiscal year 2014 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses

operating results we believe that these nongaap measures will allow for better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the

shortterm interest rates are likely to have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance as we have certain assets and liabilities primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments which are subject to changes in interest rates based on the current level of shortterm interest rates gradual increases in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this report which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a twelve month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankthe closing of the alex brown acquisition occurred late in fiscal year 2016 therefore we expect that our average interestearning assets will increase substantially in fiscal year 2017 over the average fiscal year 2016 levels the substantial client cash and margin balances associated with the alex brown division client accounts should have a favorable impact on our net interest earningsin december 2015 the federal reserve bank announced an increase in its benchmark shortterm interest rate by 25 basis points we estimate that this increase had a favorable impact on our pretax income of an amount approximating 60 million in fiscal year 2016 reflecting approximately 80 million of additional pretax income on an annualized basis our latest projection of the impact of additional increases by the federal reserve bank in its benchmark shortterm interest rate which is based upon september 30 2016 balances projects that an additional 25 basis point rise would result in an additional increase in our annual pretax income in a range of approximately 48 million to 60 million over a twelve month period the realization of such amounts is dependent upon the realization of certain key assumptions in our analysis such assumptions include our estimates of the timing and amounts of earningsdeposit rates paid on our clients cash balances client cash balance levels the level of earning assets and rj banks net interest margin in our analysis we assume that between 40 and 50 of such rate increase would also be reflected as a rate increase on earningdeposits paid on our clients cash balances we anticipate that a majority of any future increases would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fund fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments if the federal reserve bank was to reverse its december 2015 action and decrease the benchmark shortterm interest rate the impact on our net interest income would be an unfavorable reversal of the positive impact described above

on client cash balances the client interest program we also utilize a multibank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue the cash sweep program known as the raymond james bank deposit program rjbdp is a multibank rj bank and many nonaffiliated banks program under which clients cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are redeposited into interestbearing deposit accounts up to 250000 per bank for individual accounts and up to 500000 per bank for joint accounts at various third party banks this program enables clients to obtain up to 25

compared to september 30 2015 increased client assets under administration typically result in higher feebased account revenues and mutual fund and annuity service fees in periods where equity markets improve assets under administration increase and client activity generally increases thereby having a favorable impact on financial advisor productivity generally assets under administration client

advisors as of september 30 2016 reflects a net increase of 550 individuals or an 8 net increase over the number of financial advisors as of september 30 2015 the net increase results from strong financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention throughout fiscal year 2016 as well as the addition of 265 financial advisors as a result of our acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs importantly the client asset levels and productivity measures associated with those financial advisors recruited during the fiscal year exceed our historical benchmark averages notwithstanding the future impact of changes in the overall economy and more specifically their impact on future equity markets and fixed income markets factors over which we have no control we believe that this increase in productive financial advisors is a positive indication of potential future revenue growth in this segmentyear ended september 30 2016 compared with the year ended september 30 2015  private client

and service fees increased 62 million or 14 client account and service fees increased 54 million or 31 primarily due to an increase in rjbdp fees resulting from increased average balances in the program as well as the december 2015 increase in interest rates mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 6 million or 2 primarily as a result of an increase in money market processing fees and omnibus fees arising from increased client assets and positions which are paid to us by companies whose products we distribute omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our

annuity service fees fees earned on funds in our multibank sweep program and interest assets in feebased accounts in fiscal year 2016 increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increases

from annual increases in salaries increases in employee benefit plan costs and additional staffing levels primarily in pcg operations and information technology functions to support our continuing growth clearance and other expense increased 35 million or 49 primarily resulting from increases in other expense related to certain legal and regulatory expenses which are approximately 40 million higher than the prior year level sales commission expense increased 23 million or 1 which is consistent with the 1 increase in securities commissions and fees revenues communications and information

increase in client assets in fiscal year 2015 was driven by positive net inflows generated by financial advisor retention and recruiting results as the equity markets in the us were down compared to the prior year the most significant increase in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 212 million or 17 and was partially offset by a 27 million or 9 decrease in commissions on equity products a 13 million or 15 decrease in new issue sales credits due to a decrease in equity underwritings and a 4 million or 5 decrease in commissions on fixed income products fiscal year 2015 includes a 7 million decrease in mutual fund commission revenues due to the resolution of a mutual fund share class issue that resulted in refunds of commissions being paid during the year to certain of our clients despite this unusual item mutual fund commission revenues still increased 2 million compared to fiscal year 2014 commission revenues on equity products have decreased in our canadian brokerdealer subsidiary as a result of the weaker canadian currency compared to the us dollar as well as the overall challenging canadian market conditions that existed throughout fiscal year 2015 commission earnings on fixed income products in fiscal year 2015 decreased primarily due to the continuation of historically low interest rates which continue to result in challenging fixed income market conditions total account and service fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 52 million or 13 mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 37 million or 17 primarily as a result of an increase in education and marketing support ems fees which include notransactionfee ntf program revenues and mutual fund omnibus fees all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios increases in such revenues are a result of increases in the number of positions for existing fund families on the omnibus platform as well as new fund families joining the omnibus program during fiscal year 2015 client account and service fees in fiscal year 2015 increased 14 million or 9 as a result of the changes made in many of our fee schedules implemented since december 2013 in addition transaction handling fees in feebased accounts increased due to the increased number of transactions fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks increased due to higher average balances in the program and sbl affiliate servicing fees increased refer to the rj bank results of operations in this report for additional information on sbl activities as sbl balances have continued to grow in

2015 decreased slightly compared to the fiscal year 2014 level a slight decline in margin interest rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average margin loan balances outstanding the rate of growth in margin loan balances in fiscal year 2015 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our sbl product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest rate environment that existed during fiscal year 2015 and the related low net interest spreads earned there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash

sales commission expense increased 167 million or 8 largely consistent with the 6 increase in commission and fee revenues coupled with increased hiring bonuses resulting from the high level of

federal reserve bank announcement and their related commentary on interest rates combined to result in an unfavorable market environment for equity activities during much of the fiscal year as a result we experienced lower volumes in both our merger and acquisition advisory and underwriting activities throughout most of fiscal year 2016 while merger and acquisition and advisory fees are a volatile revenue source in general the number of merger and acquisition transactions in fiscal year 2016 and especially in the first three months of the fiscal year was particularly low most of the decrease in our equity underwriting revenues results from our domestic operations revenues from our canadian activities were relatively unchanged from the low amount generated in the prior year the number of both leadmanaged and comanaged underwritings in both our domestic and canadian operations decreased during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 we experienced solid performance in our public finance underwritings in the current year which positively impacted both our securities commissions and fee revenues and our investment banking revenues the combined revenues resulting from these public finance business activities increased 1 over the prior year leveltax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased 15 million or 33 due to an increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year as a market leader amongst syndicators of lowincome housing tax credit fund lihtc investments we achieved a new milestone in fiscal year 2016 by selling over 1 billion of such investments to institutional investors additionally we were able to recognize nearly 7 million in revenues that were associated with partnership interests sold in prior years which had been deferred in those years current year recognition of these previously deferred revenues results from the favorable resolution of certain conditions associated with the partnership interests as of september 30 2016 approximately 11 million of previously deferred revenues remain to be recognized in future revenues whenever such conditions for revenue recognition are fully satisfied our net trading profit increased 33 million or 60 trading profits generated in our fixed income operations increased approximately 27 million reflecting solid results in most product categories within our equity capital markets operations the prior year included 5 million of realized trading losses attributable to an equity underwriting position held in our canadian subsidiary that did not recur in the current yearother revenues increased 11 million or 68 these revenues include 5 million arising from revenues associated with our annual analyst best picks foreign exchange gains associated with certain of our international operations increased 4 millionnoninterest expenses increased 10 million or 1 sales commissions expense increased 6 million or 3 consistent with the 2 increase in institutional sales commission revenues administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 5 million or 1 consistent with annual increases in salaries and increases in employee benefit plan costs our business development expenses decreased 4 million or 9 reflecting the outcome of heightened expense managementnoncontrolling interests is primarily comprised of the net pretax impact which are net losses from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds with noncontrolling interests reflecting the portion of such losses that we do not own total segment expenses attributable to others approximate the prior year level year ended september 30 2015 compared with the year ended september 30 2014  capital marketsnet revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 7 million or 1 while pretax income decreased 24 million or 18 institutional fixed income sales commissions in fiscal year 2015 increased 38 million or 15 benefiting from increased interest rate volatility and public finance activities during fiscal year 2015 offsetting this increase institutional equity sales 49indexcommissions decreased 14 million or 5 resulting primarily from decreased equity underwriting activities throughout fiscal year 2015 particularly in the energy and real estate sectors merger and acquisitions and advisory fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 11 million or 7 reaching 162 million we experienced significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arising from our us operations led by our technology services sector and reflecting the benefit of prior years investments in other business sectors the portion of these revenues arising from our canadian operations decreased significantly due to the difficult canadian equity market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 especially in the natural resources sector our net trading profits in fiscal year 2015 decreased 5 million or 8 typically our trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities however in fiscal year 2015 the primary reason for the decrease is 5 million of realized trading losses arising in our canadian operations primarily attributable to a loss on an equity underwriting position despite the continuation of the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 fixed income trading results were solid and steady throughout the year assisted by the trading profits generated on gnma and fnma mbs underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 decreased 26 million or 26 equity underwriting activities related to both initial public offerings and followon offerings declined significantly in the fiscal year the market sectors that historically represent our areas of strength had relatively lower activity levels during fiscal year 2015 we experienced growth in our public finance underwritings in fiscal year 2015 with a 63 increase in the par value of lead managed new issues compared to the prior year this increase favorably impacts both our securities commissions and fees revenues and our investment banking revenues the combined revenues resulting from our public finance business activities in fiscal year 2015 increased 11 million or 17tax credit fund syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased by 10 million or 29 due to a 17 increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the year our continued growth in this business over the past several years has resulted in our ascension to a market leading position amongst syndicators of lihtc investments noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 26 million or 3 sales commissions expense increased 6 million or 3 which is correlated with the 5 increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues business development expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 4 million or 9 predominately in our equity capital markets operations representing recruiting and other costs as they pursue opportunities for future growth and revenues clearance and other expense increased 13 million or 19 primarily due to a higher volume of trades as reflected by the increase in institutional sales commission revenues and 3 million of expense related to historical european trading activities during fiscal year 2015 we made investments in our domestic equity capital markets business through successful recruiting of experienced professionals to broadly build out our life sciences sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in the financial services energy and government services sectors while the immediate impact of these hires results in an increase in compensation expense we believe the longterm result of these efforts will have a favorable impact on both revenues and net profits of the segmentlosses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds and in fiscal year 2015 decreased 3 million or 6 compared to fiscal year 2014 since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds nearly all of these losses are attributable to others

from managed programs decreased by approximately 1 million although financial assets under management increased 118 billion or nearly 18 net of assets managed for affiliated entities compared to the prior year level such balances have been lower on fee billing dates during the current year also a portion of the increase in assets arose from our acquisition of alex brown which occurred late in the fiscal year other income increased 6 million or 12 resulting in part from rj trust which generated an increase in trust fee income arising from their 30 increase in trust assets from the prior year level in addition eagle received increased shareholder servicing fees and money market fee sharing related to the increase in interest ratesexpenses increased by approximately 16 million or 6 primarily resulting from an 11 million or 11 increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses a 2 million or 3 increase in investment subadvisory fee expense a 2 million or 7 increase in communications and information processing expense and a 2 million or 3 increase in other expense the increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses results primarily from annual salary increases increases in personnel to support the growth of the business and increases in certain employee benefit plan costs in addition the prior year incentive compensation expense included a reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year such a reversal did not recur in the current year the increase in subadvisory fee expense results from increased assets under management in applicable programs the increase in communication and information processing expense results from increased costs in support of growth in the business the increase in other expense is in part the result of an increase in revenue sharing with pcg certain regulatory compliance and legal expenses and certain incremental costs associated with cougar including amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitionnoncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other

fiscal year 2015 increased 7 million or 5 investment advisory fee revenue in fiscal year 2015 increased by 21 million or 6 generated by an increase in assets under management that resulted from net inflows of client assets market values depreciated primarily as a result of the equity market decline that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 performance fees which are earned by managed funds for exceeding certain performance targets amounted to 5 million in fiscal year 2015 a decrease of 5 million from the amount earned in the prior year other revenue in fiscal year 2015

september 30 2015expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by approximately 18 million or 8 primarily resulting from an 8 million or 18 increase in investment subadvisory fees a 3 million or 16 increase in communications and information support processing expense and a 7 million or 14 increase in other expenses the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased fees paid to external managers for raymond james consulting services and uma programs which both experienced increases in asset levels compared to the prior year the fiscal year 2015 increase in communications and information processing expense result from additional costs associated with supporting the steadily increasing levels of assets under management as well as the

revenues increased 80 million or 19 to 494 million pretax income increased 59 million or 21 to 337 million the increase in pretax income was primarily attributable to a 75 million or 19 increase in net interest income and a 5 million or 43 increase in other income offset by an increase of 5 million or 20 in the provision for loan losses and a 16 million or 15 increase in noninterest expenses excluding provision for loan losses  the 75 million increase in net interest income was the result of a 26 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets partially offset by a small decline in net interest margin the increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 22 billion increase in average loans and a 443 million increase in average cash and investments the increase in average loans was comprised of a 14 billion or 16 increase in average corporate loans a 444 million or 35 increase in average sbl balances and a 291 million or 15 increase in average residential mortgage loans the net interest margin decreased to 304 from 307 due to an increase in average loweryielding cash balances in addition to an increase in total cost of funds to 016 from 010 the average interestearning banking assets yield increased slightly to 318 from 315 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio yield to 342 from 334 this resulted primarily from the federal reserve banks december 2015 increase in shortterm interest rates the increase in total cost of funds primarily resulted from an increase in deposit and borrowing costs which includes additional expense from our interest rate hedging activities borrowing costs increased to 181 from 061 in the prior yearcorresponding to the increase in average interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 24 billion to 143 billion the increase in the provision for loan losses as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher corporate loan growth the charges during the current year related to loans outstanding within the energy sector as well as additional provision for corporate loan downgrades resulting in higher criticized loans as compared to the prior year the provision for loan losses also reflects the offsetting impact of improved credit characteristics from the continued decline in residential mortgage loan delinquencies and nonperforming loansother income increased 5 million as compared to prior year primarily due to increases in affiliate income related to the current year growth in securitiesbased lending gains realized from the sale of available for sale securities trading gains as a result of higher sales of small business administration sba loan securitizations and lower foreign exchange lossesnoninterest

increased sbl balances a 2 million increase in communications and information processing expense a 2 million increase in compensation and benefits resulting from salary increases and staff additions and a 1 million increase in equity losses related to rj banks investment in low income housing tax credit projects these losses are by design of the investment structure income tax credits not reflected in the pretax operating results of the segment are received by rjf which net an overall positive return on such investments these increases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by a

segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 36 million or 15 compared to fiscal year 2014 the increase in pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a 63 million or 18 increase in net revenues offset by an increase of 10 million or 74 in the provision for loan losses and a 17 million or 17 increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses the increase in net revenues in fiscal year 2015 was attributable to a 57 million increase in net interest income and a 6 million increase in other income  the 57 million increase in net interest income in fiscal year 2015 was the result of a 16 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets and an increase in the net interest margin compared to fiscal year 2014 the increase in average interestearning

2015 increased 14 billion to 119 billionthe increase in other income in fiscal year 2015 was due to a decrease of 4 million in foreign currency losses a 1 million increase resulting from held for sale loan activities and a 1 million increase in gains from the sale of foreclosed propertiesa significant portion of the provision for loan losses in both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 resulted from loan portfolio growth in each year the primary factors impacting the year over year increase in provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 results from the varying impact of credit characteristics which were particular to fiscal year 2015 and 2014 the fiscal year 2015 provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in corporate criticized loans which was partially offset by the impact of improved credit characteristics of the residential mortgage loan portfolio fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from the improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio including a decrease in corporate criticized loans the 17 million increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a

arising from certain canadian denominated liabilities did not recur in the current year and interest income increased 5 million resulting from the increase in interest rates and higher corporate cash balances throughout most of the current yearinterest expense increased 1 million or 1 the most significant component of the increase was the interest expense incurred on our senior notes which increased by 2 million or 3 as the average outstanding balance increased due to our july 2016 issuance of 800 million of senior notes payable the new issuances more than offset the impact of the april

increase in revenues arising from our principal capital and private equity portfolio investments we also realized an increase in fiscal year 2015 revenues arising from the sale or redemption activities in our ars portfolio of 4 million which were offset by certain foreign currency translation losses that primarily result from the weakened canadian dollar and decreases in the valuation of

jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal year 2015 increased 8 million as the increase in revenues

generated a 650 million increase in cash increases in cash from operations includean increase in brokerage client payables had a 182 billion favorable impact on cash the increase largely results from two factors first many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts second our brokerage client account balances increased as a result of our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs cumulatively these two factors result in the increase in brokerage client payables and a corresponding increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations which is discussed belowstock loaned net of stock borrowed increased 153 millionaccrued compensation commissions and benefits increased 46 million as a result of the increased financial results we achieved in fiscal year 2016 offsetting these decreases in cash used in operations resulted from a 195 billion increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets primarily resulting from the increase in client cash balances described above64indexan increase in our brokerage client receivables and other receivables of 621 millionloans provided

shortterm borrowings of 115 million payment of dividends to our shareholders of 113 million the effect of currency exchange rates on our cash balances has resulted in a 29 million decrease in our us dollar denominated cash balance during the year ended september 30 2016 this effect is primarily attributable to cash balances we have that are denominated in canadian currency while the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate increased 17 since september 30 2015 which has a favorable impact on this measure the amount of our cash balance denominated in canadian currency has also increased the effect of which more than offsets the favorable impact of the change in exchange rateswe believe our existing assets most of which are liquid in nature together with funds generated from

financing our business total assets of 316 billion at september 30 2016 are approximately 513 billion or 19 greater than our total assets as of september 30 2015 net bank loans receivable increased 222 billion primarily due to the growth of rj banks corporate loan portfolio during the year additionally assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations for the benefit of our clients increased 198 billion most significantly due to the increase in our brokerage client payable balances discussed in the following paragraph in addition to a number of other less significant factors brokerage client receivables increased 529 million primarily resulting from an increase in margin loan balances arising from our acquisition of alex brown loans to financial advisors increased 350 million resulting from both retention incentives provided to financial advisors joining us as a result of our alex brown and 3macs acquisitions as well as loans provided to recruited financial advisors resulting from organic growth available for sale securities increased 346 million primarily resulting from an increase in such investments held by rj bank our intangible assets and goodwill increased 127 million

our liabilities as of september 30 2015 the increase is primarily due to a 234 billion increase in bank deposit liabilities as rj bank retained a higher portion of rjbdp balances to in part fund a portion of their net loan growth brokerage client payable balances increased 177 billion reflecting increases in client cash balances in brokerage accounts due to clients reacting to uncertain equity

requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs certain other derivative instruments brokered certificate 72indexof deposits corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentsinvestments in private equity measured at net asset value per shareeffective september 30 2016 we adopted new accounting guidance related to the classification and disclosure of certain investments using the net asset value nav as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of the investment among its provisions this new guidance eliminates for all investments in which fair value is measured using nav as a practical expedient the requirement to categorize such investments within the fair value hierarchy we have retroactively applied this new guidance to investments held in the prior fiscal year as a practical expedient we utilize nav or its equivalent to determine the recorded value of a portion of our private equity portfolio we utilize nav when the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and the nav of the fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting including measurement of the investments at fair value see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our private equity investments measured at nav level 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2016 8 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilities are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis in comparison as of september 30 2015 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 7 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilitiesfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 215 million as of september 30 2016 and represent 9 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2016 our ars positions comprise 125 million or 58 and our private equity investments not measured at nav comprise 83 million or 39 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 9 million or 4 as compared to the september 30 2015 level our ars portfolio decreased approximately 14 million compared to september 30 2015 primarily resulting from decreases in the valuation of the portfolio and to a lesser extent sales and redemption activities see notes 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information offsetting this decrease our private equity investments not measured at nav increased 6 million as valuation increases more than offset the net impact of capital contributeddistributions received level 3 assets represent 4 of total equity as of september 30 2016 reflecting a decrease from the 5 of total equity measure as of september 30 2015financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount are insignificant as of both september 30 2016 and 2015valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that 73indexare thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2016 and 2015 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe level within the fair value hierarchy specific valuation techniques and other significant accounting policies pertaining to certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2016 are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2016 4 of our gross trading security assets and 62 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen trading securities are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs brokered certificates of deposit and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2016 96 of our gross trading security assets and 38 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2016 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position 74indexthere is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bank the rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelsavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 85 of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 15 is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchydebt and equity securities classified as available

component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most nonagency securities at september 30 2016 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple 75indexinputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments are carried at either nav as a practical expedient or fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy our total private equity investments as of september 30 2016 amount to 195 million prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own of this 57 are valued using the nav as a practical expedient and 43 are valued at fair value the valuation of these investments at fair value requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument in comparison our total private equity investments gross value prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own as of september 30 2015 amounted to 209 million of this total 63 were valued using nav as a practical expedient and 37 were valued at fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3 see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our private equity investments including the amounts associated with noncontrolling interestsvaluation of identifiable intangible assetsduring fiscal year 2016 we acquired alex brown 3macs and mummert in each case we accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting with the assets and liabilities recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values in our consolidated financial statements the assets to be measured at fair value include any acquired identifiable intangible assets including but not limited to assets such as trade names customer relationships noncompete agreements and contracts which include favorable termsthe process of identifying potential identifiable assets to value in any acquisition transaction is subjective and involves management judgment estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates 76indexin some instances depending on the nature of the intangible asset the determination of the useful life of the asset can also be subjective and involve significant management judgmentthe outcome of the identifiable intangible asset valuation process has a direct inverse impact on the determination of the amount of goodwill arising from the application of the acquisition method of accounting for the transaction the greater the identifiable intangible asset valuation the lower the goodwill additionally the greater the identifiable intangible asset the greater amortization expense associated with such asset will be in future periods and therefore the lower future net income will begoodwill impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2016 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for certain of our reporting units and a quantitative impairment assessment for our two rj ltd reporting units operating in canada for each reporting unit that we performed qualitative assessments we determined whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessments we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any of the reporting units we elected to qualitatively analyze for impairment as of december 31 2015 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of those reporting units as of december 31 2015 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testingin the rj ltd reporting unit testing we elected to perform quantitative assessments for the two reporting units within rj ltd that include an allocation of goodwill although gaap provides the option to perform a qualitative analysis which may result in a conclusion that no quantitative analysis of the reporting unit equity value is required for this years annual goodwill testing of our two rj ltd reporting units we elected to perform a quantitative analysis in these analyses we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and discount rates as well as utilize data from peer group companies to assess the equity value of each rj ltd reporting unit based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd pcg reporting unit was substantially in excess of its book carrying value which includes goodwill however primarily as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the prolonged commodity recession in canada on our business most specifically impacting the natural resources sector of that economy the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd ecm reporting unit is not substantially in excess of its book carrying value which includes goodwill the rj ltd ecm reporting unit goodwill balance was 169 million as of december 31 2015 and we estimate that the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value including goodwill approximates 10 should the equity market conditions in canada fail to improve or we otherwise fail to perform as we have projected an impairment charge of some portion or perhaps all of such goodwill could occur refer to note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of the valuation methodologies and a summary of the key assumptions we applied in determining the fair value of our two rj ltd reporting units  no events have occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testingdeterioration in economic market conditions especially those impacting revenues reported in our pcg and capital markets segments as well as increased costs arising from the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in reporting unit performance beyond managements current expectations declines in reporting unit performance increases in equity capital requirements or increases in the estimated cost of equity could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill77indexloss

evaluating its probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring a substantial amount of judgment due to the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate and the allowance for loan losses could then be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank the provision for loan losses in the current year includes a provision resulting from an increase in the qualitative reserve related to loans in the energy sectorincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each

federal income taxes have been provided because the time or manner of repatriation is uncertain we cannot determine the impact of local taxes withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with

statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence levelwe apply the feds market risk rule mrr for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios the mrr also known as the riskbased capital guidelines market risk rule released by the fed occ and fdic requires us to calculate var numbers for all of our trading portfolios including fixed income equity foreign exchange and derivative instrumentsto calculate var we use historical simulation this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions such as in interest rates and equity prices are representative of future changes the simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months var is reported at a 99 confidence level for a oneday time horizon assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our oneday var estimates about once every 100 trading days or about three times per year on average for regulatory capital calculation purposes we also report var numbers for a tenday time horizonthe feds mrr requires us to perform daily back testing procedures of our var model whereby we compare each days projected var to its regulatorydefined daily trading losses which excludes fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading based on these daily ex ante versus ex post comparisons we verify that the number of times that regulatorydefined daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99 confidence level during the twelve months ended september 30 2016 our regulatorydefined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our

commercial and residential real estate loans as well as mbs and cmos both of which are held in the available for sale securities portfolio sba loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans those earning assets are primarily funded by rj banks obligations to customers ie customer deposits based on its current earning asset portfolio rj bank is subject to interest rate risk the current economic environment has led to an extended period of low market interest rates as a result the majority of rj banks adjustable rate assets and liabilities have experienced a reduction in interest rate yields and costs that reflect these very low market interest rates during the year rj bank has focused its interest rate risk analysis on the risk of market interest rates rising rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both in a range of interest rate scenariosone of the objectives of rj banks asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right but not the obligation to repay before the scheduled maturity to ensure that rj bank is within its limits established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios rj bank utilizes an internally developed assetliability model using standard industry software to analyze the available data the model estimates changes in net interest income by calculating interest income and interest expense from existing assets and liabilities using current repricing prepayment and volume assumptions various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income in february 2015 we implemented a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of rj banks asset and liability management process described above for further information regarding this risk management objective see the discussion of the rj bank

comprehensive incomecredit riskcredit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activitieswe are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performanceour client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin accounts which are monitored daily and are collateralized we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will renege on the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss however most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed we offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss in the event that such borrower declares bankruptcy or is no longer affiliated with us historically such losses have not been significant due to our strong advisor retention and successful collection effortswe are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the us government or its agencies receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made including underwritings may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses we seek to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty the size of the position or commitment the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstandingthe valuation of the nonagency cmos held as available for sale securities by rj bank is impacted by the credit risk

credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate loans and individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with corporate and residential mortgage credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information rj bank seeks to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for probable incurred loan losses rj bank utilizes a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate loans and related unfunded lending commitments including the probability of default andor loss given default of each corporate loan and commitment outstanding for its sbl and residential mortgage loans rj bank utilizes the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loansrj banks allowance for loan losses methodology is described in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as rj banks loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for loan losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as followscampi loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre construction loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as described above in addition project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segmenttaxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentresidential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower loantovalue ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or other types of nontraditional loan products loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentsbl loans in this segment are secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of securities which will bring the loan current and may bring the loan within the prescribed ltv guidelines in evaluating credit risk rj bank considers trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors during fiscal year 2016 corporate profit levels declined slightly and have remained weak as compared to historic levels unemployment rates have remained relatively flat retail sales continue to be sluggish and credit quality trends while improved in some sectors remain somewhat tenuous the volatility in residential home values in certain geographies has continued to have an impact on 89indexresidential mortgage loan performance all of these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs however during fiscal year 2016 corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september 30 2016 including the risk profile of the portfolios net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio finally rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio rj bank determined the allowance that was required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis rj bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate there was no material change in rj banks methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses during the twelve months

syndicated borrowing relationships in which rj bank is involved repurchase agreements and other collateralized financingswe purchase securities under shortterm agreements to resell reverse repurchase agreements additionally we sell securities under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements both reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financings and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest our policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under the reverse repurchase agreements to ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient the securities are valued daily and collateral is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when contractually required these reverse repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations financial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased and fair valuefinancial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement datein determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurementslevel 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securitieslevel 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mortgagebacked securities mbs certain other derivative instruments brokered certificates of deposit corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include auction rate securities ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loans110indexgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrumentwe offset our long and short positions for a particular security recorded at fair value as part of our trading instruments long positions and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased short positions when the long and short positions have identical committee on uniform security identification procedures numbers cusipsvaluation techniques the fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2016 and 2015 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe level within the fair value hierarchy specific valuation techniques and other significant accounting policies pertaining to financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described as followslevel 1 measurestrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased trading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries these instruments are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period net incomewhen available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of our trading securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieslevel 2 measureswhen trading securities are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs brokered certificates of deposit and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsa portion of our financial instruments classified on our consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of our available for sale securities are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the valuation methodologies of such financial instruments are discussed in the available for sale securities section that followswe are a party to various derivative contracts that are classified as level 2 within the fair value hierarchy the valuation methodologies of such financial instruments are discussed in the derivatives contract section that follows111indexrj bank maintains a trading portfolio of certain corporate loans that it originates through the syndication market these trading instruments are included in trading securities are recognized as of the trade date and are carried at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses reflected in net trading profit these trading instruments are valued using quotes from a third party pricing service these third party pricing service quotes are based on current market data provided by multiple dealers the instruments are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the market inputs utilized by the third party pricing service are based upon observable inputs we validate the third party pricing service quotes by comparing such prices to those provided by another external sourcerj bank maintains certain loans held for sale which are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the valuation methodologies of such financial instruments are discussed in the loans held for sale and allowances for losses section that followslevel 3 measurespositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchya portion of our financial instruments classified on our consolidated statements of financial condition as a component of our available for sale securities are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy the valuation methodologies of such financial instruments are discussed in the available for sale securities section that followswe hold private equity investments that are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy the valuation methodologies of such financial instruments are discussed in the private equity investments section that followsio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyincluded within trading securities are to be announced tba security contracts with investors for generic mbs securities at specific rates and prices to be delivered on settlement dates in the future these tbas are entered into by rjampa as a component of a hedging strategy to hedge interest rate risk that it would otherwise be exposed to as part of a program its fixed income public finance operations offers to certain state and local housing finance agencies hfa under this program rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase government national mortgage association gnma or federal national home mortgage association fnma mbs the mbs securities are issued on behalf of various hfa clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs rjampas forward gnma or fnma mbs purchase commitments arise at the time of the loan reservation for a borrower in the hfa lending program these loan reservations fix the terms of the mortgage including the interest rate and maximum principal amount the underlying terms of the gnma or fnma mbs purchase including the price for the mbs security which is dependent upon the interest rates associated with the underlying mortgages are also fixed at loan reservation upon acquisition of the mbs security rjampa typically sells such security in open market transactions as part of its fixed income operations given that the actual principal amount of the mbs security is not fixed and determinable at the date of rjampas commitment to purchase these forward mbs purchase commitments do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument these tba securities are accounted for at fair value and are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy the tba securities may aggregate to either a net asset or net liability at any reporting date depending upon market conditions the offsetting purchase commitment is accounted for at fair value and is included in either other assets or other liabilities depending upon whether the tba securities aggregate to a net asset or net liability the fair value of the purchase commitment is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy 112indexavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities these securities are generally classified at the date of purchase as available for sale securities the rj bank afs securities are used as part of rj banks interest rate risk and liquidity management strategies and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates changes in prepayment risks or other factorsinterest on the rjf afs securities is recognized in interest income on an accrual basis for the rj bank afs securities discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated average life of the security realized gains and losses on sales of any rjf afs securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period soldunrealized gains or losses on any rjf afs securities except for those that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are recorded through other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on our consolidated statements of financial conditionfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at a reporting period end we make an assessment whether such securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered in order to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the securitywe intend and have the ability to hold the rjf afs securities to maturity we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these available for sale securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis those securities whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired and are written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in shareholders equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security for any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidity expected principal and interest cash flows on the impaired debt security are discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the time of acquisition the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment otti recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securitythe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy113indexfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were at one time able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyderivative contractstradingwe enter into interest rate swaps or futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate client transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account these derivatives are accounted for as trading account assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition any realized or unrealized gains or losses including interest are recorded in net trading profit within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted bycounterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of these interest rate derivative contracts is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelsmatched bookwe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through raymond james financial products llc rjfp a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary rjfp enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with clients for every derivative transaction rjfp enters into with a client it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the client transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution any collateral required to be exchanged under these derivative contracts is administered directly by the client and the third party financial institution rjfp does not hold any collateral or administer any collateral transactions related to these instruments we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rjfp recognizes revenue on derivative transactions on the transaction date computed as the present value of the expected cash flows rjfp expects to receive from the third party financial institution over the life of the derivative contract the difference between the present value of these cash flows at the date of inception and the gross amount potentially received is accreted to revenue over the term of the contract the revenue from these transactions is included within other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedgesrj bank enters into threemonth forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of aoci with such balance impacting earnings in the event the net investment is sold or substantially liquidated gains and losses on the undesignated derivative instruments as well as amounts representing hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at each reporting period using a method that is based on changes in 114indexforward rates the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the beginning balance of the foreign net investment at the inception of the hedging relationship and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the terms of the hedging instrument and hypothetical derivative match at inception there is no expected ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the forward exchange contracts is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the cash flows associated with certain assets held by rj bank provide interest income at fixed interest rates therefore the value of these assets absent any risk mitigation is subject to fluctuation based upon changes in market rates of interest over time beginning in february 2015 we entered into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bankthe rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cash flow hedge component of aoci and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings specifically upon the incurrence of interest expense on certain borrowings the ineffective portions of the related gain and loss are immediately recognized into earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and each reporting period utilizing regression analysis and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the key terms of the hedging instrument and hedged transaction match at inception management expects there to be no ineffectiveness impacting earnings from this hedge while it is outstanding as a result of these derivative transactions being executed through a clearing exchange we are required to provide the exchange with either a cash deposit or qualified securities such deposit balances are included as a component of deposits with clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we

or its equivalent as a practical expedient to determine the fair value of our private equity investments when the fund does not have a readily determinable fair value the nav of the fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investmentcompany accounting including measurement of the underlying investments at fair value 115indexand it is not probable that we will sell the investment at an amount other than nav the nav is calculated based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the fund as provided by the fund manager the portion of our private equity

advisors and allowance for doubtful accountsbrokerage client receivables include receivables from the clients of our brokerdealer and asset management subsidiaries the receivables from brokerdealer clients are principally for amounts due on cash and margin transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by the clients the receivables from asset management clients are primarily for accrued investment advisory fees both the receivables from the asset management and brokerdealer clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts when a receivable held by one of our brokerdealer subsidiaries is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or brokerdealer price quotations securities beneficially owned by customers including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions are not reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition see note 19 for additional information regarding this collateralwe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes these loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned there is no fee income associated with these loans we assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts related to former employees or independent contractors management primarily considers our historical collection experience as well as other factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship and the former financial advisors overall financial position when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balance of such loan is writtenoff and the corresponding allowance is reduced based upon the nature of these financing receivables we do not analyze this asset on a portfolio segment or class basis further the aging of this receivable balance is not a determinative factor in computing our allowance for doubtful accounts as concerns regarding the recoverability of these loans primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us we present the outstanding 116indexbalance of loans to financial advisors on our consolidated statements of financial condition net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of the gross balance outstanding the portion associated with financial advisors who are no

rj bank segregates its loan portfolio into six portfolio segments campi commercial real estate cre cre construction taxexempt residential mortgage and securities based loans sbl these portfolio segments also serve as the portfolio loan classes for purposes of credit analysis except for residential mortgage loans which are further disaggregated into residential first mortgage and residential home equity classesloans held for salecertain residential mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market due to their fixed interest rate terms as well as sba loans purchased and intended for sale in the secondary market but not yet aggregated for securitization into pools are each carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value the fair value of the residential mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using observable prices obtained from counterparties for similar loans these nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy rj bank purchases the guaranteed portions of sba section 7a loans and accounts for these loans in accordance with the policy for loans held for sale rj bank then aggregates sba loans with similar characteristics into pools for securitization and sells these pools in the secondary market individual loans may be sold prior to securitization the determination of the fair value of the sba loans depends upon their intended disposition the fair value of the sba loans to be individually sold are determined based upon their committed sales price the fair value of the loans to be aggregated into pools for securitization which are committed to be sold are determined based upon third party price quotes the fair value of all other sba loans are determined using a third party pricing service the prices for the sba loans other than those committed to be individually sold are validated by comparing the third party price quote or the third party pricing service prices as applicable for a sample of loans to observable market trades obtained from external sourcesonce the sba loans are securitized into a pool the respective securities are classified as trading instruments and are carried at fair value based on rj banks intention to sell the securitizations within the near term any changes in the fair value of the securitized pools as well as any realized gains or losses earned thereon are reflected in net trading profit sales of the securitizations are accounted for as of settlement date which is the date rj bank has surrendered control over the transferred assets rj bank does not retain any interest in the securitizations once they are sold the fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price 117indexevaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchycorporate loans which include campi cre cre construction and taxexempt are designated as held for investment upon inception and

offbalance sheet loan commitmentsrj bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases rj banks policy is generally to require customers to provide collateral at the time of closing the amount of collateral obtained if it is deemed necessary by rj

bank recognizes the revenue associated with corporate syndicated standby letters of credit which is generally received quarterly on a cash basis the effect of which does not differ materially from recognizing in the period the fee is earned unused corporate line fees are accounted for on an accrual basisnonperforming assetsnonperforming assets are comprised of both nonperforming loans and oreo nonperforming loans represent those loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans which have been restructured in a manner that grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loans with such restructurings are discussed further below additionally any accruing loans which are 90 days or more past due and in the process of collection are considered nonperforming loansloans of all classes are placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that full payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt or the loan is past due 90 days or more as to contractual interest or principal unless the loan in our opinion is wellsecured and in the process of collection when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is written off against interest income and accretion of the net deferred loan origination fees cease interest is recognized using the cash method for sbl and residential first mortgage and home equity loans and the cost recovery method for corporate loans thereafter until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status loans are returned to an accrual status when the loans have been brought contractually current with the original or amended terms and have been maintained on a current basis for a reasonable period generally six monthsother real estate acquired in the settlement of loans including through or in lieu of loan foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs through a charge to the allowance for loan losses thus establishing a new cost basis subsequent to foreclosure valuations are periodically performed by rj bank and the assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value as determined by a current appraisal or valuation less estimated costs to sell and are classified as other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition these nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy costs relating to development and improvement of the property are capitalized whereas those relating to holding the property are charged to operations sales of oreo are recorded as of the settlement date and any associated gains or losses are included in other revenue on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive incometroubled debt restructuringsa loan restructuring is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring tdr if we for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties grant a concession we would not otherwise consider in tdrs for all classes of loans the 118indexconcessions granted such as interest rate reductions generally do not reflect current market conditions for a new loan of similar risk made to another borrower in similar financial circumstances for those restructurings of first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage loans which may reflect current market conditions the concessions granted by rj bank are generally interest capitalization principal forbearance release of liability ordered under chapter 7 bankruptcy not reaffirmed by the borrower or an extension of the interestonly or maturity period the concessions granted in restructurings of corporate loans are similar to those for residential mortgage loans and may also include the reduction of the guarantors liability first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage tdrs may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of six months of satisfactory performance corporate tdrs have generally been partially chargedoff and therefore remain on nonaccrual status until the loan is fully resolvedimpaired loansloans in all classes are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that rj bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest on a loan when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired rj bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration reasons for the delay the borrowers prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed for individual loans identified as impaired impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate and taking into consideration the factors described below in relation to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses except that as a practical expedient rj bank measures impairment based on the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent impaired loans include all corporate nonaccrual loans all residential mortgage nonaccrual loans for which a chargeoff had previously been recorded and all loans which have been modified in tdrs interest income on impaired loans is recognized consistently with the recognition policy of nonaccrual loansallowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitmentsrj bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio based on ongoing evaluations of the portfolio the related risk characteristics and the overall economic and environmental conditions affecting the loan portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when rj bank believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance rj bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of risk considering all available information in developing this assessment rj bank relies on estimates and exercises judgment in evaluating credit risk the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available depending on changes in circumstances future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses estimates that are particularly susceptible to change that may have an impact on the amount of the allowance includethe selection of proxy data used to calculate loss factorsthe evaluation of loss emergence and historical loss experience periodsour evaluation of the risk profile of loan portfolio segments including internal risk ratingsthe value of underlying collateral which impacts loss severity and certain cash flow assumptionsour selection and evaluation of qualitative factors which reflect the imprecision that is inherent in the estimation of probable loan lossesthe allowance for loan loss is comprised of three components allowances calculated based on formulas for homogeneous classes of loans collectively evaluated for impairment specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment and allowances resulting from our analysis of certain qualitative factors the homogeneous classes are a result of managements disaggregation of the loan portfolio and are comprised of the previously mentioned classes campi cre cre construction taxexempt residential first mortgage residential home equity and sblan annual analysis of the loss emergence period estimate which is the average length of time between the event that triggers a loss and the confirmation andor chargeoff of that loss is performed for all loan classes this analysis is utilized in establishing the allowance for each of the classes of loans through the application of an adjustment to the calculated allowance percentage for the respective loan grade the loans within the corporate loan classes are assigned to an internal loan grade based upon the respective loans credit characteristics the loans within the residential first mortgage residential home equity and sbl classes are assigned loan grades 119indexequivalent to the loan classifications utilized by bank regulators dependent on their respective likelihood of loss we assign each loan grade for all loan classes an allowance percentage based on the estimated incurred loss associated with that grade the allowance for loan losses for all nonimpaired loans is then calculated based on the allowance percentage assigned to the respective loans class and grade factoring in the respective loss emergence period the allowance for loan losses for all impaired loans and those nonaccrual residential mortgage loans that have been evaluated for a chargeoff are based on an individual evaluation of impairment as previously described in the impaired loans sectionthe quantitative factors taken into consideration when assigning the loan grades and allowance percentages to the loans within the corporate loan classes include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral type past loss history shared national credit snc reviews and examination results from bank regulators loan grades for individual campi and taxexempt loans are derived from analyzing two aspects of the risk profile in a particular loan the obligor rating and the facility collateral rating the obligor rating relates to a borrowers probability of default and the facility rating is utilized to estimate the anticipated loss given default these two ratings which are based on historical longterm industry loss rates proxy data as rj bank has limited loss history are considered in combination with certain adjustments for the loss emergence period to derive the final campi and taxexempt loan grades and allowance percentages the allowance for loans within the cre and cre construction loan portfolios is based on either a probability of default and loss given default methodology or analyses of peer group and industry loss history in combination with certain adjustments for loss emergence period the quantitative loss rates for corporate loans are supplemented by considering qualitative factors that may cause estimated losses to differ from quantitatively calculated amounts these qualitative factors are intended to address developing external and environmental trends and include but are not limited to trends in delinquencies loan growth loan terms changes in geographic distribution changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateraldependent loans lending policies loan review process experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff local regional national and international economic conditions competition legal and regulatory requirements and concentrations of credit riskhistorical loan loss rates a quantitative factor are utilized when assigning the allowance percentages for residential first mortgage loans and residential home equity loans these estimated loss rates are based on rj banks historical loss data over a period of time rj bank currently utilizes a look back period for residential first mortgage and home equity loans reflecting the current housing cycle that includes the last downturnthe sbl portfolio is not yet seasoned enough to exhibit a loss trend therefore the allowance is based primarily on peer group allowance information and the qualitative factors noted below for residential first mortgage loan residential home equity loan and sbl classes the qualitative factors considered to supplement the quantitative analysis include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores at origination occupancy ie owner occupied second home or investment property documentation level loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size loan policy exceptions updated loantovalue ltv ratios and the factors noted above that are utilized for corporate loans as tdrs regardless of the loan portfolio segment or accrual status are impaired loans rj bank evaluates its credit risk on an individual loan basis the amount of impairment recorded on these loans is primarily measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if collateral dependent based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell in addition all redefaults 60 or more days delinquent subsequent to the loans modification date on tdrs are factored into each portfolio segments allowance for loan losses qualitative information such as geographic area and industry for tdrs and redefaulted tdrs is considered and reviewed in the determination of expected loss rates previously discussedrj bank reserves for losses inherent in its unfunded lending commitments using a methodology similar to that used for loans in the respective portfolio segment based upon loan grade and expected funding probabilities for fully binding commitments this will result in some reserve variability over different periods depending upon the mix of the loan portfolio at the time and future funding expectations all classes of impaired loans which have unfunded lending commitments are analyzed in conjunction with the impaired reserve process previously described loan chargeoff policiescorporate loans are monitored on an individual basis and loan grades are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure they reflect the loans current credit risk when rj bank determines that it is likely a corporate loan will not be collected in full the loan is evaluated for potential impairment after consideration of the borrowers ability to restructure the loan alternative sources of repayment and other factors affecting the borrowers ability to repay the debt the portion of the loan deemed to be a confirmed 120indexloss if any is chargedoff for collateraldependent loans secured by real estate the amount of the loan considered a confirmed loss and chargedoff is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the collaterals appraised value less estimated costs to sell in instances where the individual loan under evaluation is agented by another bank and where the agent bank has not ordered a timely update of an outdated appraisal rj bank may make adjustments to previous appraised values for purposes of calculating specific reserves or taking partial chargeoffs these impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we evaluate on an ongoing basis all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation certain factors such as guarantor recourse additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals in its ongoing evaluation of each individual loan rj bank may consider more frequent appraisals in locations where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility for campi and taxexempt loans rj bank evaluates all sources of repayment including the estimated liquidation value of collateral to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and chargedoff corporate banking and credit risk managers also hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans loans that are rated special mention or worse as defined by bank regulators see note 9 for further discussion additional chargeoffs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flowsthe majority of rj banks corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in either sncs or other large syndicated loans in the us or canada the sncs are us loan syndications totaling over 20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions most snc loans are reviewed semiannually by the agent banks regulator a process in which the other participating banks have no involvement once the snc regulatory review process is complete rj bank receives a summary of the review of these snc credits from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ this summary includes a synopsis of each loans regulatory classification loans that are designated for nonaccrual status and directed chargeoffs rj bank must be at least as critical with nonaccrual designations directed chargeoffs and classifications as the occ this ensures that each bank participating in a snc loan rates the loan at least as critical any classification changes may impact rj banks reserves and chargeoffs during the quarter that the snc information is received from the occ however these differences in classifications are generally minimal given the size of the snc loan portfolio the amount of such adjustments depend upon the classification and whether rj bank had the loan classified differently either more or less critically than the snc review findings and therefore could result in higher lower or no change in loan loss provisions than previously recorded rj bank incorporates into its ratings process any observed regulatory trends in the semiannual snc exam process but there will inherently be differences of opinion on individual credits due to the high degree of judgment involved with respect to its ongoing credit evaluation process of the snc portfolio rj bank conforms to what it believes will be the regulators view of individual credits corporate loans are subject to rj banks internal review procedures and regulatory review by the occ as part of rj banks regulatory examinationevery residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due is reviewed by rj bank personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status current valuation estimate and other data points rj bank senior management meets monthly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoffwritedown recommendations on every residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due with chargeoffs considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and then generally taken before the loan is 120 days past due a chargeoff is taken against the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that rj bank estimates will ultimately be collected based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell rj bank predominantly uses broker price opinions bpo for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the collection and foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed bpos contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace and therefore we have found these bpos to be reasonable determinants of market value in lieu of appraisals and more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values a full appraisal is obtained postforeclosure rj bank takes further chargeoffs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original bpo but does not reverse previously chargedoff amounts if the appraisal is higher than the original bpo if a loan remains in preforeclosure status for more than nine months an updated valuation is obtained and further chargeoffs are taken against the allowance for loan losses if necessary other assets rj bank carries investments in stock of the federal home loan bank of

to service mortgage loans known as mortgage servicing rights msrs are an intangible asset our msrs arise when rj bank sells residential mortgage loans and retains the associated mortgage servicing rights rj bank records the estimated fair value of msrs and amortizes msrs in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue msrs are assessed for impairment quarterly based on their fair value with any impairment recognized in other expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive incomegoodwill goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the related net assets acquired gaap does not provide for the amortization of indefinitelife intangible assets such as goodwill rather these assets are subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired however if the estimated fair value is below carrying value further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment this further analysis involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount in the course of our evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill we may perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment 122indexanalysis is not necessary under this elective process we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative analysis is not required however if we conclude otherwise then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis if we either choose not to perform a qualitative assessment or we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred then we perform a quantitative evaluation in the case of a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit which the goodwill that is subject to the quantitative analysis is associated generally defined as the businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compare it to the carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the excess we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date see note 13 for additional information regarding the outcome of our goodwill impairment assessmentscontingent liabilitieswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated whether a loss is probable and if so the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount within that range if the most likely amount of possible loss within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible we record liabilities related to legal and regulatory proceedings in trade and other payables on our consolidated statements of financial condition the determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management management considers many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding or significant regulatory matter is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability balance is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the actual costs of resolving legal matters or regulatory proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for such matters we expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurredsharebased compensationwe account for sharebased awards through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values the compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards and is calculated as the market value of the awards on the date of the grant see note 24 for additional information in addition we account for sharebased awards to our independent contractor financial advisors in accordance with guidance applicable to accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services and guidance applicable to accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock sharebased awards granted to our independent contractor financial advisors are measured at their vesting date fair value and their fair value estimated at reporting dates prior to that time the compensation expense recognized each period is based on the most recent estimated value further we classify certain of these nonemployee awards as liabilities at fair value upon vesting with changes in fair value reported in earnings until these awards are exercised or forfeited see note 24 for additional information compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased compensation with future service requirements over the requisite service period using the straightline method and in certain instances the graded attribution methodas

subsidiaries attaining certain financial results and will ultimately be settled in db common shares as traded on the nyse provided the performance metrics are achieved the portion of these awards that relate to past services performed by the award recipients before the acquisition of alex brown represents consideration transferred in the business combination the portion of these awards which relate to compensation for 123indexfuture services are a prepaid compensation asset which has a corresponding derivative liability the prepaid compensation asset is amortized over the remaining requisite

term commences on the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date on which we take possession of the property for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays we record a deferred rent liability in other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition and amortize the deferred rent over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in instances where the office space or equipment under an operating lease will be abandoned prior to the expiration of the lease term these instances primarily result from the effects of acquisitions we accrue an estimate of any projected loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income at the time

subsidiary are tax affected to the extent the canadian subsidiarys earnings will be repatriated to the us income taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries

are subject to assessment when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie other than for the managed funds whose process is discussed separately the process for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie is to conclude whether we are a party to the vie holding a variable interest that meets both of the following criteria 1 has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and 2 has the obligations to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the vieeif funds the eif funds are limited partnerships for which we are the general partner the eif funds invest in certain of our private equity activities as well as other unaffiliated venture capital limited

accordingly consolidate this trust fundlihtc fundsrjtcf is the managing member or general partner in a number of lihtc funds having one or more investor members or limited partners these lowincome housing tax credit funds are organized as llcs or limited partnerships for the purpose of investing in a number of project partnerships which are limited partnerships or llcs that in turn purchase and develop lowincome housing properties qualifying for tax credits our determination of the primary beneficiary of each tax credit fund in which rjtcf has a variable interest requires judgment and is based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances including 1 an assessment of the characteristics of rjtcfs variable interest and other involvement it has with the tax credit fund including involvement of related parties and any de facto agents as well as the involvement of other variable interest holders namely limited partners or investor members and 2 the tax credit funds purpose and design including the risks that the tax credit fund was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders in the design of tax credit fund vies the overriding premise is that the investor members invest solely for tax 125indexattributes associated with the portfolio of lowincome housing properties held by the fund while rjtcf as the managing member or general partner of the fund is responsible for overseeing the funds operations nonguaranteed lowincome housing tax credit fundsas the managing member or general partner of the fund except for one guaranteed fund discussed below rjtcf does not provide guarantees related to the delivery or funding of tax credits or other tax attributes to the investor members or limited partners of tax credit funds the investor

level residuals rjtcf earns fees from the fund for its services in organizing the fund identifying and acquiring the project partnership investments ongoing asset management fees and a share of any residuals arising from sale of project partnerships upon the termination of the fundthe determination of whether rjtcf is the primary beneficiary of any of the nonguaranteed lihtc funds in which it holds a variable interest is primarily dependent upon 1 the analysis of whether the other variable interest holders in the tax credit fund hold significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the tax credit funds economic performance andor 2 whether rjtcf has an obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the tax credit fund vie which could potentially be significant to the fundrjtcf sponsors two general types of nonguaranteed tax credit funds either nonguaranteed single investor funds or nonguaranteed multiinvestor funds in single investor funds rjtcf has concluded that the one single investor member or limited partner in such funds has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund resulting in a conclusion of shared power with the limited partner therefore rjtcf as managing member or general partner of such funds is not the one party with power over such activities and resultantly is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such single investor funds and these funds are not consolidatedin multiinvestor funds rjtcf has concluded that since the participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund are not held by one single investor member or limited partner rjtcf is deemed to have the power over such activities rjtcf then assesses whether its projected benefits to be received from the multiinvestor funds primarily from ongoing asset management fees or its share of any residuals upon the termination of the fund are potentially significant to the fund rjtcf is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates any multiinvestor fund for which it concludes that such benefits are potentially significant to the fund among the lihtc fund entities evaluated rjtcf determined that some of the lihtc funds it sponsors are not vies these funds are either 1 funds which rjtcf holds a significant interest one of which typically holds interests in certain tax credit limited partnerships for less than 90 days or until beneficial interest in the limited partnership or fund is sold to third parties or 2 are single investor lihtc funds in which rjtcf holds an interest but the lihtc fund does not meet the vie determination criteriadirect investments in lihtc project partnershipsrj bank is the investor member of a lihtc fund in which a subsidiary of rjtcf is the managing member this lihtc fund is an investor member in certain lihtc project partnerships we evaluate the appropriate accounting for these investments after aggregating rj bank and rjtcfs interests and roles in the lihtc fund since unrelated third parties are the managing member of the investee project partnerships we have determined that consolidation of these project partnerships is not required we account for these investments under the equity method the carrying value of these project partnerships is included in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition see note 10 for additional informationguaranteed lihtc fundin conjunction with one of the multiinvestor tax credit funds in which rjtcf is the managing member rjtcf has provided the investor members with a guaranteed return on their investment in the fund the guaranteed lihtc fund as a result of this

and discounted cash flows for impaired loans that are not collateral dependentqualitative disclosure about unobservable inputsfor our recurring fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in significant unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those unobservable inputs are described belowauction rate securitiesone of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of auction rate securities presented within our available for sale securities portfolio relates to judgments regarding whether the level of observable trading activity is sufficient to conclude markets are active where insufficient levels of trading activity are determined to exist as of the reporting date then managements assessment of how much weight to apply to trading prices in inactive markets versus managements own valuation models could significantly impact the valuation conclusion the valuation of the securities impacted by changes in managements assessment of market activity levels could be either higher or lower depending upon the relationship of the inactive trading prices compared to the outcome of managements internal valuation modelsthe future interest rate and maturity assumptions impacting the valuation of the auction rate securities are directly related as shortterm interest rates rise due to the variable nature of the penalty interest rate provisions embedded in most of these securities in the event auctions fail to set the securitys interest rate then a penalty rate that is specified in the security increases these penalty rates are based upon a stated interest rate spread over what is typically a shortterm base interest rate index management estimates that at some level of increase in shortterm interest rates issuers of the securities will have the economic incentive to refinance and thus prepay the securities therefore the shortterm interest rate assumption directly impacts the input related to the timing of any projected prepayment the faster and steeper shortterm interest rates rise the earlier prepayments will likely occur and the higher the fair value of the securityprivate equity investmentsthe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of private equity investments relate to the financial performance of the investment entity and the markets required return on investments from entities in industries in which we hold investments significant increases or decreases in our investment entities future economic performance will have a directly proportional impact on the valuation results the value of our investment moves inversely with the markets expectation of returns from such investments should the market require higher returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will decrease in value should the market accept lower returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will increase in valueinvestments in private equity measured at net asset value per shareas a practical

federal regulations and other segregated assets securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair

market rates under the fair value hierarchy cash and cash equivalents and assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets are classified as level 1 securities either purchased or sold under 140indexagreements to resell and other collateralized financings are classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy because they are generally variable rate instruments collateralized by us government or agency securitiesbank loans net  these financial instruments are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased by rj bank and include campi loans commercial

held for sale are included in the nonrecurring fair value measurements in addition to any impaired loans held for investmentfair values for both variable and fixedrate loans held for investment are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality this methodology for estimating the fair value of loans does not consider other market variables and therefore is not based on an exit price concept the majority of fair value determinations for these loans are classified as level 3

to recover all unrealized losses not already recorded in earnings on our nonagency cmos however it is possible that the underlying loan collateral of these securities will perform worse than current

as followspass  loans which are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or guarantors if any or by the fair value less costs to acquire and sell of any underlying collateral in a timely mannerspecial mention  loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention these loans are not adversely classified and do not expose rj bank to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classificationsubstandard  loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged if any loans with this classification are characterized by the distinct possibility that rj bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not correcteddoubtful  loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currentlyknown facts conditions and valuesloss  loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance on rj banks books as an asset without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or chargeoff is not warranted rj bank does not have any loan balances within this classification because in accordance with its accounting policy loans or a portion

described in note 2 goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended march 31 2016 evaluating the balances as of december 31 2015 we assign goodwill to reporting units our reporting units include a private client group reporting unit comprised of our rjampa domestic retail brokerage operations and tpc included in our private client group segment rjampa fixed income included in our capital markets segment and rjampa equity capital markets included in our capital markets segment in addition we have two rj ltd reporting units rj ltd private client group included in our private client group segment and rj ltd capital markets included in our capital markets segment each associated with our canadian operations and we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for each of the canadian reporting unitsqualitative assessmentsfor each reporting unit that we performed qualitative assessments on we determined whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessments we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any of the reporting units we elected to qualitatively analyze as of december 31 2015 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of those reporting units as of december 31 2015 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testing161indexquantitative assessmentsfor our two rj ltd reporting units we elected not to perform a qualitative assessment but instead to perform quantitative assessments of the equity value of each rj ltd reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill in our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit under the market approach we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges and the book value of comparable transactions the estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows in estimating future cash flows a balance sheet as of the december 31 2015 impairment test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit were compiled future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections the cash flows were discounted at the reporting units

million at september 30 2016 which represents the undiscounted future payments due the investorlegal and regulatory matter contingenciesin addition to the matters specifically described below in the normal course of our business we have been named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions including arbitrations class actions and other litigation arising in connection with our activities as a diversified financial services institutionwe are also subject from time to time to other reviews investigations and proceedings both formal and informal by governmental and selfregulatory agencies regarding our business such proceedings may involve among other things our sales and trading activities financial products or offerings we sponsored underwrote or sold and operational matters some of these proceedings have resulted and may in the future result in adverse judgments settlements fines penalties injunctions or other relief andor require us to undertake remedial actionswe cannot predict if how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement fine penalty or other relief if any may be a large number of factors may contribute to this inherent unpredictability the proceeding is in its early stages the damages sought are unspecified unsupported or uncertain it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis the other party is seeking relief other than or in addition to compensatory damages including in the case of regulatory and governmental proceedings potential fines and penalties the matters present significant legal uncertainties we have not engaged in settlement discussions discovery is not complete there are significant facts in dispute and numerous parties are named as defendants including where it is uncertain how liability might be shared among defendantswe contest liability andor the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter over the last several years the level of litigation and investigatory activity both formal and informal by government and selfregulatory agencies has increased significantly in the financial services industry while we have identified below certain proceedings that we believe could be material individually or collectively there can be no assurance that material losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been asserted or are not yet determined to be materialwe include in some of the descriptions of individual matters below certain quantitative information about the plaintiffs claim against us as alleged in the plaintiffs pleadings or other public filings although this information may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter it does not represent our estimate of reasonably possible loss or our judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual related theretosubject to the foregoing we believe after consultation with counsel and consideration of the accrued liability amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements that the outcome of such litigation and regulatory proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition however the outcome of such litigation and proceedings could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period depending on among other things our revenues or income for such periodexcluding contingent liabilities arising out of the matters specifically described below as well as any amounts subject to the belowdescribed indemnification from regions as of september 30 2016 we currently estimate that the aggregate range of possible loss is from 0 to 10 million in excess of the accrued liability if any related to litigation or regulatory matters refer to note 2 for a discussion of our criteria for recognizing liabilities for contingencies related to such matters we and one of our financial advisors are named defendants in various lawsuits related to an alleged fraudulent scheme conducted by ariel quiros quiros and william stenger stenger involving the misuse of eb5 investor funds in connection with the jay peak ski resort in vermont jay peak and associated limited partnerships plaintiffs in the lawsuits allege that quiros misused 200 million of the amounts raised by the limited partnerships and misappropriated 50 million for his personal benefit there are six civil court actions pending in which we or one of our subsidiaries are named the plaintiffs variously demand among other things compensatory damages treble damages under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and punitive damagesgiven the early stage of the cases the complexity of the forensic accounting necessary to determine the amount of actual investor losses the identification and availability of any assets for recovery by the plaintiffs and the potential for insurance coverage a range of possible loss in excess of the amount accrued cannot be estimated while there can be no assurance that we will be successful we intend to vigorously defend the claims against us182indexmorgan keegan

securities as either principal or agent on behalf of our clients if either the client or counterparty fails to perform we may be required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party in such circumstances we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is different from the contract value of the transactionin a number of instances in the discussions that follow reference is made to collateral note 19 provides additional information regarding the recorded balances in the consolidated statements of financial condition and the collateral balances related thereto we also act as an intermediary between brokerdealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one brokerdealer and then lend them to another securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions we measure the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis the market value of securities borrowed was 915 million and securities loaned was 696 million at september 30 2016 and the market value of securities borrowed was 834 million and securities loaned was 397 million at september 30 2015 the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 934 million and 758 million respectively at september 30 2016 and the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 863 million and 444 million respectively at september 30 2015 additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized if another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed for example failure to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transactionwe have also loaned to brokerdealers and other financial institutions securities owned by clients and others for which we have received cash or other collateral the market value of securities loaned was 5953 million and 4326 million at september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively the contract value of securities loaned was 602 million and 4342 million at september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively if a borrowing institution or brokerdealer does not return a security we may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return it to the owner in such circumstances we may incur a loss equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial institution or the brokerdealer we have sold securities that we do not currently own and will therefore be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date we have recorded 329 million and 288 million at september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively which represents the market value of such securities see notes 5 and 6 for further information we are subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal yearend we utilize short positions on government obligations and equity securities to economically hedge long inventory positionswe enter into security transactions on behalf of our clients and other brokers involving forward settlement forward contracts provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument the contractual amounts related to these financial instruments reflect the volume and activity and do not reflect the amounts at risk the gain or loss on these transactions is recognized on a trade date basis transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument our exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors including the duration size composition and diversification of positions held the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and market volatility the credit risk for these transactions is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains recorded in the consolidated statements of financial conditionthe majority of our transactions and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure is with clients brokerdealers and other financial institutions in the us these activities primarily involve collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk can be directly 194indeximpacted by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations we seek to control our credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties financial condition and credit ratings we monitor collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and request changes in collateral levels as appropriate as a part of our fixed income public finance operations rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase gnma or fnma mbs see note 2 and note 21 for information on these commitments we utilize tba security contracts to hedge our interest rate risk associated with these commitments we are subject to loss if the timing of or the actual amount of the mbs securities differs significantly from the term and notional amount of the tba security contracts we enter into rj ltd is subject to foreign exchange risk primarily due to financial instruments denominated in us dollars that may be impacted by fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in order to mitigate this risk rj ltd enters into forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of these contracts is not significant as of september 30 2016 forward contracts outstanding to buy and sell us dollars totaled cdn 242 million and cdn 236 million respectively rj bank is also subject to foreign exchange risk related to its net investment in a canadian subsidiary see note 18 for information regarding how rj bank utilizes net investment hedges to mitigate a significant portion of this riskrj bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases which then extend over varying periods of time these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments and each customers credit worthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis fixedrate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and rj banks exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments rj banks commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments outstanding are as follows as of september 30 2016 2015 in thousandsstandby letters of credit29686 60925open end consumer lines of credit primarily sbl3616933 2531690commercial lines of credit1430630 1419746unfunded loan commitments354556 322419in the normal course of business rj bank issues or participates in the issuance of standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary these standby letters of credit generally expire in one year or less as of september 30 2016 297 million of such letters of credit were outstanding in the event that a letter of credit is drawn down rj bank would pursue repayment from the party under the existing borrowing relationship or would liquidate collateral or both the proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to clients and accordingly rj bank uses a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitmentsopen end consumer lines of credit primarily represent the unfunded amounts of rj bank loans to customers that are secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of creditbecause many of rj banks lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or part the contract amounts are not estimates of rj banks actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements rj bank maintains a reserve to provide for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments see note 9 for further discussion of this reserve for unfunded lending commitments credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that the collateral or other security is of no value rj bank uses the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments and other creditrelated offbalance sheet instruments as it does in making loans195indexnote 27  earnings per sharethe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share year ended september 30 2016 2015 2014 in thousands
