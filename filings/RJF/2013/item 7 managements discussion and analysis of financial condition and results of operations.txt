the following managements discussion and analysis mdampa is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition the mdampa is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2013 compared with the year ended september 30 2012 we achieved record net revenues of 45 billion a 679 million or 18 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record net revenues and pretax earnings this fiscal year revenues were higher in fiscal year 2013 in part because the results include twelve months of morgan keegan operations as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012 in addition fiscal year 2013 net revenues include a 65 million gain on a proprietary capital investment a 227 million impact to rjf net revenues after noncontrolling interests which further elevated our revenues our pretax income increased 93 million or 20 compared to the prior year to 564 million excluding the acquisition related expenses primarily resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition we generated adjusted pretax income of 644 million a nongaap measure1 a 21 increase over the prior year earnings per share increased 17 over the prior year to 258 per share excluding the acquisition related expenses mentioned above adjusted earnings per share a nongaap measure1  increased 18 to 295 per share all of our operating segments performed well during the year as each achieved record levels of pretax income total client assets under administration were a record 4254 billion at september 30 2013 a 10 increase over the prior year level noninterest expenses increased 553 million or 17 primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of expenses from legacy morgan keegan businesses increases in compensation related expenses information technology expenses and acquisition related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the bank loan loss provisionsignificant milestones achieved in fiscal year 2013 include the midfebruary 2013 transfer of all of the morgan keegan financial advisors and client accounts from the morgan keegan platform to the rjampa platform following that conversion and allowing time for the former morgan keegan financial advisors to become proficient in the use of the rjampa platform in the june 2013 quarter we implemented staff reductions these reductions occurred mainly within our information technology groups where there was significant overlap in historic morgan keegan and rjampa support staffing that we had elected to maintain through the platform conversion date in order to ensure the continued high levels of service to financial advisors and clients while we operated on two different platforms retention levels remain very high for the legacy morgan keegan financial advisors the morgan keegan capital markets businesses were also integrated primarily fixed income and public finance investment banking during the year and further staff reductions were made given these accomplishments as of september 30 2013 our various morgan keegan integration initiatives have been substantially and successfully completed1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the nongaap reconciliation section of this mdampa34indexa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year in addition to the impact of twelve months of morgan keegan operations in the current year compared to six months in the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 29 billion an 18 increase while pretax income increased 7 to 230 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts pretax income was negatively impacted by an increase in commission expenses driven primarily by the increase in corresponding commission revenues as well as an increase in communication and information processing expense client assets under administration of the private client group increased 9 over the prior year to 4026 billion at september 30 2013 the capital markets segment generated net revenues of 927 million a 15 increase while pretax income increased 35 to 102 million we experienced significant increases in institutional fixed income commission revenues merger and acquisition fees and fixed income investment banking revenues equity capital markets commission levels increased as a result of improved equity market conditions results from our equity capital markets investment banking business have been uneven throughout the year characterized by intermittent periods of significant activity and ending the year with strong results our fixed income operations improved overall but were negatively impacted during times of adverse fixed income market conditions these adverse conditions resulted from medium and longer term interest rate volatility which negatively impacted our trading results our asset management segment generated revenues of 293 million a 23 increase while pretax income increased 43 to 96 million assets under management in managed programs increased 31 to a record 56 billion as of september 30 2013 strong net inflows of client assets in managed programs including from legacy mk amp co branches market appreciation and our acquisition of an interest in clarivest contributed to the increase rj bank generated 268 million in pretax income an 11 increase the increase resulted primarily from the significant decrease in the loan loss provision expense and an increase in net interest income the decrease in the loan loss provision expense resulted from an improved credit environment the favorable resolution of certain problem loans and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in average loans outstanding in our nonoperating other segment our results reflect a 6 million increase in our pretax loss this segment includes certain corporate expenses our principal capital and our private equity activities our results were favorably impacted by the sale of our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion in april 2013 the albion investment generated an increase of 18 million in pretax income net of noncontrolling interests we also experienced other less significant increases on other investments in our private equity portfolio those increases were more than offset by additional acquisition and integration related costs incurred from the morgan keegan acquisition and a full years interest expense associated with debt financings executed in march 2012 to finance a portion of the acquisitionour earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 decreased to 349 from 373 in fiscal year 2012 the tax rate decrease primarily resulted from a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings as well as a significant increase in nontaxable income associated with the change in market value of companyowned life insurancewith regard to regulatory changes that could impact our businesses in the future our view of the potential impact to us of future regulations is substantially unchanged by the regulatory activities that occurred during the year based on our review of the doddfrank act and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole however because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain 35indexyear ended september 30 2012 compared with the year ended september 30 2011on april 2 2012 we completed our acquisition of morgan keegan from regions this acquisition expands both our private client and our capital markets businesses morgan keegan brings to us a strong private client business one of the industrys top fixed income and public finance groups and a significant equity capital markets division headquartered in memphis with 57 fullservice offices in 20 states morgan keegan had approximately 3100 employees and over 900 financial advisors as of the date of our purchase 892 of whom have been retained as of september 30 2012 while an addition of this size is a departure from our focus on organic growth supplemented by individual hires and small acquisitions it is not a departure from our overall strategy we have used strategic mergers to grow throughout our history when the timing and pricing were right and most importantly when there was a strong cultural fit and clear path for integration with the addition of morgan keegan we are one of the countrys largest wealth management and investment banking firms affording us even greater ability to support our financial advisors and retail and institutional clientsour fiscal year 2012 results include six months of morgan keegan results and therefore comparisons to prior years are not necessarily meaningful for many of our key financial and operating metrics furthermore integration of both equity and fixed income capital markets began immediately following the closing date which precludes the determination of legacy morgan keegan results in those areas regarding our integration plans our plan is to migrate all the private client financial advisors and client accounts off of the morgan keegan platforms and fully integrate those operations onto our rjampa platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013despite the somewhat challenging market conditions during the fiscal year most of our businesses performed relatively well as we accomplished record annual net revenue and net income levels our net revenues of 38 billion represent a 14 increase compared to the prior year excluding net revenues estimated to be attributable to the addition of morgan keegan net revenues increased 2 compared to the prior year all of our segments realized increased revenues over the prior year total client assets under administration increased to 386 billion a 51 increase as compared to the prior year approximately 85 billion of the client assets under administration total are associated with legacy morgan keegan branches our private client group and capital markets segments benefited significantly from the acquisition of morgan keegan noninterest expenses increased 455 million or 16 from the prior year primarily due to the addition of morgan keegan the fiscal year 2012 noninterest expenses include 59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred specifically associated with the morgan keegan acquisition while the prior year includes 41 million pertaining to a nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased the bank loan loss provision decreased 8 million from the prior year reflecting the overall improvement in the credit markets over that periodinclusive of the impact of the acquisition of morgan keegan our pretax income increased 10 million or 2 while our net income increased 18 million or 6 as compared to the prior year after consideration of the acquisition related expenses we incurred and the 2 million of incremental interest expense we incurred as part of the preclosing date execution of our morgan keegan purchase financing strategies we generated adjusted pretax income of 533 million a nongaap measure 1 in fiscal year 2012 after adjusting fiscal year 2011 for the effect of the nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased we generated adjusted pretax income of 503 million a nongaap measure 1 reflecting an increase in adjusted pretax income a nongaap measure 1 of 30 million or 6 in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior yearour financial results during fiscal year 2012 were most significantly impacted byour private client group segment generated net revenues of 25 billion in fiscal year 2012 a 13 increase over the prior year pretax income of 215 million represents a 2 decrease compared to the prior year the increase in revenues is in large part due to our acquisition of morgan keegan and the high levels of retention of the morgan keegan financial advisors since the acquisition closing date client assets under administration of the private client group increased 44 at september 30 2012 as compared to the prior year to 368 billion which is a result of both the assets brought on by morgan keegan branches and 19 growth in legacy rjf private client assets fiscal year 2012s pretax income was negatively impacted by a significant increase in our technology costs resulting from system enhancements to existing platforms and projects which address numerous regulatory requirements 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the nongaap reconciliation section of this mdampa36indexthe capital markets segment realized a 7 million or 8 decrease in pretax income after adjusting for the adverse impact of the emerging markets businesses the segment generated an increase in pretax income of 5 million or 6 as compared to the prior year this despite very challenging equity capital markets conditions throughout the year as a result of our morgan keegan acquisition we realized substantially increased fixed income institutional sales commissions as well an increase in trading profits compared to the prior year our acquisition of morgan keegan provides us with significantly increased scale in the capital markets industry primarily as it pertains to fixed income operations and public finance weakness in the equity capital markets throughout the year significantly impacted both our institutional equity sales commission levels as well as our equity underwriting fee revenues a decrease in fiscal year 2012 equity capital markets activity in canada which had a particularly strong prior year also had a significant negative impact on our fiscal year 2012 segment resultsour asset management segment generated 67 million of pretax income in fiscal year 2012 a 2 increase compared to the prior year assets under management increased to record levels as of september 30 2012 net inflows of client assets including assets of morgan keegan clients and appreciation in the market values of assets drove the increase rj bank generated a 67 million or 39 increase in pretax income over the prior year to a record 240 million the increase primarily resulted from an increase in net interest revenues resulting from higher average loan balances while maintaining the net interest spread at a level consistent with the prior year and a lower loan loss provision resulting primarily from improved credit characteristics both in our loan portfolio and in the markets as a wholein our nonoperating other segment our results reflect a 127 million pretax loss this segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities which produced pretax income of 15 million after consideration of the attribution to noncontrolling interests generated by income received and positive valuation adjustments arising from certain of our investments in that portfolio the segment also includes 59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred in fiscal year 2012 that were associated with the morgan keegan acquisition as well as 62 million of interest expense the interest expense includes additional interest expense resulting from march 2012 financings to fund a portion of the morgan keegan acquisitionour effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 decreased to 373 from the prior year rate of 397 primarily resulting from gains realized in fiscal year 2012 as compared to losses in the prior year on our companyowned life insurance investments which are not subject to tax during january 2012 rjfs application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the fed and rj banks conversion to a national bank was approved by the occ these changes became effective february 1 2012 this status better represents the way rj bank has been conducting its business37indexsegmentseffective september 30 2013 we implemented changes in our reportable segments the changes are a result of managements assessment of the usefulness and materiality of certain of our historic reportable segments the effect of the change is that we now report the following five business segments private client group capital markets asset management rj bank and the other segment prior period amounts related to the change in reportable segments have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation the

only held in our rj bank segment but also held in our pcg and capital markets segments which are subject to changes in interest rates these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments an increase in shortterm interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in shortterm interest rates a gradual increase in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this form 10k which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using rj banks own internal assetliability modelbased upon our analysis we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates could result in an increase in our pretax income in the range of approximately 140 million to 170 million over a twelve month period approximately half of such an increase would be attributable to account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase attributable to net interest income reported in both our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2013 and conservative assumptions related to interest rates earned by clients on their cash balances in various interest rate environments the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the vast majority of any incremental benefit to pretax income from a rise in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume that a significant portion of any further incremental increase in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense 40indexthe following table presents our consolidated average interestearning asset and liability balances interest income and expense

nominal favorable impact on our net interest revenues despite increases in client balances outstandingrj banks net interest income increased 17 million or 5 primarily as a result of an increase in average loans outstanding partially offset by a decrease in net interest margin refer to the discussion of the specific components of rj banks net interest income in the rj bank section of this mdampainterest income earned on our available for sale securities portfolio decreased from the prior year due to significantly lower yields on the portfolio which more than offset the increase

client accounts from the mk amp co platform were transferred to and integrated with the rjampa platformsecurities commissions and fees increased 399 million or 19 a significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of morgan keegan on april 2 2012 which brought over 900 financial advisors into pcg 863 of whom were retained through the february 2013 integration of the morgan keegan operations into those of rjampa securities commissions and fee revenues generated by our canadian operations increased 6 over the prior year despite a small decrease in the total number of pcg

of 4026 billion in the pcg segment increased 349 billion or 9 as compared to september 30 2012 primarily resulting from equity market appreciation in the usclient account and service fee revenues increased 13 million or 9 over the prior year the increase primarily results from an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program balances in this program increased primarily as a result of the transfer of mk amp co client accounts to the raymond james program additional mk amp co client accounts also resulted in an increase in service fee income which increased as a result of the additional client account volume in addition we realized an increase in fees resulting from assets invested in alternative investment funds44indexmutual fund

all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute in addition to an increase in the mutual fund assets on which these fees are generally paid during the past year we implemented changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements the offsetting increased costs we have incurred to third parties to provide the additional information is included in communications and information processing expenses discussed below effective with our midfebruary 2013 platform integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs further increasing this revenuepartially offsetting the increases in revenues described in the preceding two paragraphs client transaction fees decreased 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting over the past year to a ntf program and an april 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain nonmanaged feebased accounts under the mutual fund ntf program we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs other revenues increased by 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of spreads earned on crosscurrency transactions within our canadian operations total segment revenues increased 18 the portion of total

september 30 2012the amount of net interest in the pcg segment was nearly unchanged from the prior year level increases in client margin balances and client cash balances outstanding over the year were nearly completely offset by further decreases in interest rates as a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2013 there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from the client cash balance increase as the interest spread earned on client balances were at historically low levels refer to the discussion of how the pretax income of this segment could be favorably impacted by a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates in the net interest section of this mdampa noninterest expenses increased 430 million or 19 over the prior year sales commission expense increased 275 million or 18 consistent with the 19 increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 61 million or 14 this increase resulted primarily from the impact of a full year of salaries and benefits expense associated with the increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of the morgan keegan associates communications and information processing expense increased 49 million or 43 computer software development costs and other information technology related costs which include consulting expenses increased over 42 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms costs associated with operating two platforms for a portion of the year additional reporting requirements including regulatory requirements and expenses associated with omnibus arrangements refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above occupancy and equipment expense increased 18 million or 19 primarily due to a full years rent and other facility related expenses associated with the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition clearance and other expenses increased 27 million or 38 these expense increases can generally be attributed to clearing and floor brokerage expenses resulting from the additional volume of client accounts and transactions arising from the morgan keegan acquisition growth in our legacy operations and the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between segments than within the historic mk amp co operations which impacts prior year comparisons 45indexyear ended september 30 2012 compared with the year ended september 30 2011  private client groupnet revenues in fiscal year

239 million in fiscal year 2012 or 13 over the prior year amount a significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of morgan keegan on april 2 2012 which brought over 900 financial

increased 25 million in fiscal year 2012 or 20 over the prior year the portion of these revenues generated from morgan keegan clients is 10 million of the remaining increase the primary component is the result of an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program the fees increased as a result of higher balances in the program mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 26 million in fiscal year 2012 or 24 over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees ems fees and ntf program revenues all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during the past year we have been implementing a change in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements the largest portion of this conversion occurred midway through fiscal year 2011 excluding the impact of the revenues generated from morgan keegan clients these revenues increased 23 million or 21 as compared to the prior year the morgan keegan client mutual fund positions will be eligible for our omnibus program following conversion to the rjampa platformpartially offsetting the increases in revenues described above client transaction fees decreased 13 million in fiscal year 2012 or 37 compared to the prior

increase in assets in feebased accounts over the preceding year balances resulted from the addition of the assets in the feebased accounts of morgan keegan pcg net interest revenues increased 13 million in fiscal year 2012 or 18 over the prior year primarily resulting from an increase in client margin balances there was a decrease in net interest earned on client cash balances as more of these funds are being swept into our multibank sweep program where a fee is earned by pcg instead of interest a portion of the increase in client margin balances resulted from the addition of the balances associated with morgan keegan clients46indexnoninterest expenses increased 297 million in fiscal year 2012 or 15 over the prior year sales commission expense increased 159 million or 12 generally consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 76 million or 22 the increase primarily results from increases in

comparisons of our legacy capital markets results especially fixed income operations to our current results48indexour fixed income revenues were significantly higher for the current year as compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of a full years morgan keegan results the combination of our former fixed income operations with morgan keegans fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business net revenues increased by 123 million or 15 total institutional sales commissions increased 15 over the prior year equity institutional sales commissions increased 17 million or 7 primarily due to improved equity market conditions the 60 million or 22 increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions over the prior year is primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations after the morgan keegan acquisition and the inclusion of twelve months of the combined entities operations in the current year as compared to only six months in the prior year our significantly larger public finance fixed income operations as a result of the morgan keegan acquisition favorably impacted both our investment banking revenues and our securities commissions and fees the number of lead and comanaged equity underwritings as well as merger amp acquisition transactions during the current year increased significantly in our us operations as compared to the prior year in the latter part of the first quarter of our fiscal 2013 concerns related to the then pending fiscal cliff crisis had at least in part a favorable impact on our equity capital markets business as underwriting and merger and acquisition activity improved significantly as issuers sought to complete certain equity transactions in advance of any anticipated tax law changes the activity levels experienced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 slowed considerably thereafter until a very active fourth quarter for the year the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of merger and acquisition fees were technology services energy technology financial services healthcare and general industrials capital markets activities in our canadian operations have remained sluggish throughout the year continuing to reflect the adverse market conditions which existed throughout the prior fiscal year particularly in the businesses in which we focus such as natural resourcesthe primary contributor to our fixed income investment banking revenues is our public finance investment banking operations the volume of our lead and comanaged public finance underwritings increased significantly over the prior year this favorable comparison is in part due to the positive impact of the inclusion of the public finance operations we acquired from morgan keegan in our results for an entire yearthe decrease in tax credit syndication fee revenues results from an increase in the amount of fee revenues that have been deferred to be recognized at later dates upon completion of certain revenue recognition criteria the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year is slightly higher than in the prior yeardespite our increase in fixed income trading capacity resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition our trading profit results for the year while positive overall have been unfavorably impacted by adverse conditions in the municipal fixed income market this market has been impacted during the current year by a number of factors municipal fixed income markets were negatively impacted during first quarter by discussions and rumors regarding potential changes in the tax laws pertaining to limits or caps on the taxexempt advantages of municipal fixed income instruments the fiscal cliff in response to these uncertainties interest rates on municipal securities increased during december 2012 which negatively impacted our trading results during the third quarter the 10year benchmark interest rate increased over 60 basis points in a very short period of time may through june 30 2013 resulting in very little demand for municipal fixed income securities in the market and valuation losses on municipal securities held in inventory which negatively impacted our third quarter trading results during the fourth quarter interest rates retreated somewhat back to their early may 2013 levels and our trading results were strong especially in municipal products during that period all of these factors considered in conjunction with what were strong municipal fixed income trading results in the prior year resulted in unfavorable trading profits in yearoveryear comparisons49indexnoninterest expenses increased 98 million or 13 over the prior year primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 41 million or 22 which is correlated with the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 15 and includes the impact of the shift to a higher proportion of commissions being fixed income sales which are paid higher commissions including certain retentionrelated expenses implemented as part of the morgan keegan acquisition administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 39 million or 10 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel from the morgan keegan acquisition communications and information processing expense increased 7 million or 13 as a result of new technology initiatives and a full year of morgan keegan expenses goodwill impairment expense associated with rjes of 7 million see discussion below and a 6 million increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities discussed below contributed to the increase in other expense these increases are partially offset by a decrease in clearance and other expense of 8 million or 18 the decrease results primarily from the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between the capital markets and the pcg segments within rjampa as compared to the historic mk amp co operations which favorably impact prior year comparisons refer to the pcg results of operations herein for a discussion of an offsetting unfavorable prior year comparison within that segmentduring the second quarter we incurred impairment expense associated with the rjes operations of 69 million however since we did not own 100 of rjes as of march 31 2013 23 million of this expense is attributable to others and is included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests amount attributable to others therefore the net impact of this goodwill impairment on the pretax results after consideration of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests is 46 million refer to the goodwill section of this item 7 and note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on this goodwill impairment expenselosses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds nearly all of these losses are attributable to others and are therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on the consolidation of vies  noncontrolling interests include the consolidation of rjes for periods prior to april 2013 the period in which we acquired the interests previously held by others as well as the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which impacts other revenue interest expense and losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies as described in the previous paragraph by including the portion of these consolidated entities

marketspretax income in fiscal year 2012 in the capital markets segment decreased 7 million or 8 as compared to the prior year this segment includes the activities of our emerging markets businesses whose operations generated a 7 million pretax loss in fiscal year 2012 which is 12 million worse than the pretax income generated by those operations in fiscal year 2011 certain of the capital markets businesses of the morgan keegan brokerdealer we acquired on april 2 2012 were immediately integrated into rjampas operations on the date of acquisition other morgan keegan capital markets businesses are being integrated into rjampa over time morgan keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the fiscal year 2012 results therefore comparisons of our legacy capital markets operations especially fixed income operations to our current operations are not meaningful our plan is to fully integrate all of the historic morgan keegan capital markets businesses into rjampa by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2013the weakness in the equity capital markets negatively impacted our results our fixed income results reflect significant improvement

million or 109 increase in institutional fixed income sales commissions a 26 million or 108 increase in trading profits a 21 million or 130 increase in fixed income investment banking revenues and a 9 million increase in private placement fees these revenue increases were partially offset by a 40 million or 35 decrease in equity underwriting fees a 31 million or 12 decrease in institutional equity sales commissions a 13 million or 16 decrease in merger and acquisitions fees and a 4 million or 12 decrease in tax credit fund syndication fees lingering concerns over the eu debt crisis and the us economy had a negative impact on the capital markets for most of fiscal year 2012 fixed income sales commissions increased over the prior year primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations the increase in fixed income investment banking revenues was primarily the result of the increase in underwriting fees of 23 million which arose from the morgan keegan fixed income public finance operations we acquired although equity market levels at the end of fiscal year 2012 finished at higher levels than the prior year the market for public offerings during fiscal year 2012 has been erratic the number of lead and comanaged underwritings during the year increased in our us operations and decreased significantly in our canadian operations fiscal year 2011 was a particularly strong year for our canadian equity capital markets operations but market conditions in the industries in which they are concentrated energy and mining have slowed significantly since the prior year equity underwriting fees arising from our operations in emerging markets decreased 15 million in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior year fiscal year 2011 revenues include fees arising from our argentine joint venture which acted as an advisor to institutional clients in several significant transactions during that prior year resulting in the unfavorable comparison to fiscal year 2012 our tax credit fund syndication subsidiary sold approximately 596 million in tax credit fund partnership interests to investors during fiscal year 2012 a decrease compared to the record volume of 616 million sold in fiscal year 2011 trading profits for fiscal year 2012 increased 26 million or 108 as compared to the prior year the yearoveryear increase results in part from the acquisition of morgan keegan as trading profits arise primarily from fixed income products after our acquisition of morgan keegan we have more fixed income trading professionals then we had prior to the acquisition providing us a greater platform from which to generate trading profits to support the increased number of trading professionals our inventories of fixed income products has also increasednoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased 132 million or 21 over the prior year primarily driven by the addition of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 47 million or 34 which is directly correlated to the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 28 and includes the shift to a higher percentage of fixed income sales administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 50 million or 15 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition a full year of consolidation of rjes which became effective when we acquired a controlling interest in that subsidiary in april 2011 and to a lesser extent the annual increase in salary and benefits costs the increase in clearance and other expense primarily resulted from an increase of approximately 15 million in clearance expenses arising from the larger combined fixed income operations morgan keegans allocation methodology and 2 million of expense in fiscal year 2012 arising from the amortization of various intangible assets which arose as a result of the morgan keegan acquisitionnoncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which also impacts other revenue interest expense and other expenses within this segment see note 11 of the

benefits costs a 7 million or 25 increase in investment subadvisory fees a 4 million or 12 increase in other expenses and a 3 million or 16 increase in communications and information processing expense the increase in administrative and incentive compensation expense is a result of the combination of increases in salary expenses resulting from the addition of clarivest annual increases and additions to staff associated with our legacy operations as well as an increase in performance compensation which is directly related to the increase in investment advisory fee revenues the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense is directly related to the increase in advisory fees paid to the external managers associated with certain assets included within the uma and raymond james consulting services programs the increase in other expense is primarily due to increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other brokerdealers and increases in the expenses of rjt result from the increase in client assets the increase in communication and information processing expense is primarily a result of the addition of clarivest operations and costs associated with the implementation of a new backoffice system supporting this segment year ended september 30 2012 compared to the year ended

while asset values have increased by 55 billion despite the decrease in assets under management in nonmanaged programs experienced during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 resulting in lower revenue during our first quarter of fiscal year 2012 assets in nonmanaged programs steadily increased during fiscal year 2012 as a result of the manner in which our fee revenues are computed the

approximately 10 million or 6 in fiscal year 2012 resulting from a 5 million or 6 increase in administrative and performance based incentive compensation and a 5 million or 17 increase in other

increase of 11 million or 3 in net revenues and a 23 million or 90 decrease in the provision for loan losses offset by a 7 million or 9 increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses the 11 million increase in net revenues was attributable to a 17 million increase in net interest income partially offset by a 6 million decrease in other income  net interest income increased 17 million or 5 primarily as a result of a 13 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets this increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 11 billion increase in average loans as well as increases in both average investments and cash the significant increase in average loans resulted from a strong corporate lending market including our canadian lending operation which began in late february 2012 and growth in the recently introduced securities based lending product the yield on interestearning banking assets decreased to 334 from 361 due to declines in both the loan and investment yields the loan portfolio yield decreased to 386 from 420 due to a reduction in the corporate loan portfolio yield resulting from tightened credit spreads and the repricing of existing loans at lower rates in addition the yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined as a result of adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates as well as lower rates on new production primarily as a result of the decrease in the yield of the average interestearning assets the net interest margin decreased to 325 from 350corresponding to the increase in interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 12 billion to 93 billion  the decrease in other income was primarily due to a 7 million decrease in foreign currency gainslosses from prior year levels a 2 million loss in the valuation of rj banks bankowned life insurance and a prior year gain of 2 million resulting from a settlement with a residential mortgage loan servicer these were partially offset by a 3 million reduction in otherthantemporary impairment otti losses on our available for sale securities portfolio and a 2 million increase in

criticized loans the favorable resolution of corporate problem loans lower loantovalue ltv ratios in the residential mortgage loan portfolio and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans these credit characteristics reflected the positive impact from improved economic conditions net loan chargeoffs decreased 11 million or 45 to 13 million 58indexthe 7 million increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to a 3 million or 18 increase in compensation and benefits expenses related to staff additions to support

our securities based lending businessyear ended september 30 2012 compared to the year ended september 30 2011  rj bankpretax income generated by the rj bank segment increased 67 million or 39 as compared to the prior year the improvement in pretax income was primarily attributable to an increase of 67 million or 25 in net revenues and an 8 million or 23 decrease in the provision for loan losses offset by an 8 million or 13 increase in other noninterest expenses net revenue was positively impacted by a 51 million increase in net interest income 6 million less in otti losses on our available for sale securities portfolio and an improvement of 8 million in foreign currency transaction gains on canadian dollar denominated loans in the corporate loan portfolio  net interest income increased 57 million over the prior year excluding the impact of a 6 million correction recorded in the prior year primarily as a result of a 12 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets this increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 12 billion increase in average corporate loans while there were increases in the small business administration sba and consumer loan portfolios as well as cash and investments these were largely offset by a decrease in residential mortgage loans the yield on interestearning banking assets of 361 was consistent with 360 in the prior year the average loan portfolio yield was 420 as compared to 425 in the prior year the loan portfolio yield decreased due to a decline in the yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio resulting from adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates which offset an increase in the corporate loan portfolio yield average corporate loans outstanding include the impact of the purchase of 400 million of canadian loans on february 29 2012 the net interest margin increased 007 from the prior year to 350 due to a small increase in the yield on earning assets and a small decrease in the average cost of funds corresponding to the increase in interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 11 billion to 81 billion  the provision for loan losses during the year was positively impacted by a reduction in both campi and cre nonperforming loans improved credit characteristics of certain problem loans and the reduction of the balance

information on regulatory and capital requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap for a description of our accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our significant accounting estimates those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosures71indexfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain cmos certain mbs and our derivative instruments and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital activities certain nonagency cmos certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2013 and 2012 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described below72indextrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securitiestrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieswhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsthe fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities which include ars we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyderivative contractswe enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our legacy operations are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument73indexwe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through rjss rjss enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with customers of rjampa for every derivative transaction rjss enters into with a customer it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the customer transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges available for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most senior nonagency securities at september 30 2013 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy74indexfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with third parties andor discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the partnership as provided by the fund manager investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyother investmentsother investments consist primarily of marketable securities we hold that are associated with a deferred compensation program which was formerly sponsored by mk ampco term deposits with canadian financial institutions or investments in other securities arising from the operations of rj ltd and certain investments in limited partnerships or funds for which in a number of instances one of our affiliates serves as the managing member or general partner see note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information regarding such funds certain employees who were at onetime associated with mk amp co participate in deferred compensation plans the balances associated with these plans are invested in certain marketable securities that are held by rjf until the vesting date typically five years from the date of the deferral we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these investments such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchythe canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost which approximates market value these investments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy certain other investments in financial instruments held by rj ltd include nonagency abs that have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation and are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy75indexlevel 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2013 9 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilities are instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basisfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 470 million as of september 30 2013 and represent 24 of our assets measured at fair value our ars positions comprise 242 million or 51 and our private equity investments comprise 216 million or 46 of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2013 level 3 assets represent 117 of total equity as of september 30 2013financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount to 60 thousand as of september 30 2013 and represent less than 1 of liabilities measured at fair valuesee notes 5 6 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentsgoodwillgoodwill involves the application of significant management judgment of our total goodwill of 295 million 230 million arose from our fiscal year 2012 acquisition of morgan keegan see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding the morgan keegan acquisition and as of september 30 2013 is part of rjampa 33 million arose from our acquisition of goepel mcdermid inc now rj ltd which occurred during fiscal year 2001 30 million arose from our acquisition of roney amp co now part of rjampa which occurred during fiscal year 1999 and 2 million arose from our acquisition of howe barnes which occurred in april 2011 and is now a part of rjampa this goodwill was allocated to reporting units 174 million is included in the pcg segment and 121 million is included in the capital markets segment goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2012 we elected to not exercise the option to perform a qualitative assessment but instead to perform a quantitative assessment of the equity value of each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill in our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit under the market approach we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges and the book value of comparable transactions the estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows in estimating future cash flows a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit or for the nine month period since the closing date for morgan keegan reporting units were compiled future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections the cash flows were discounted at the reporting units estimated cost of equity which was derived through application of the capital asset pricing model the valuation result from the market approach was dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings finally significant management judgment was applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach which resulted in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments as of december 31 2012 we concluded that with the exception of our rjes reporting unit there was no other impairment of goodwill and the fair values of the equity of the reporting units to be substantially in excess of their book carrying values which include the allocated goodwill see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a summary of certain key assumptions utilized in our quantitative analysis performed as of december 31 2012 the assumptions and estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting unit equity are sensitive to changes including but not limited to a decline in overall market conditions adverse business trends and changes in regulations 76indexwe concluded the goodwill associated with the rjes reporting unit to be completely impaired the impairment expense recorded in the year ended september 30 2013 of 69 million is included in other expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the annual testing date our share of this impairment expense after consideration of the noncontrolling interests amounts to 46 million rjes is an entity that provides research coverage on european corporations as well as having sales and trading operations the decline in value of rjes is primarily due to the continuing economic slowdown experienced in europe which has had a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended march 31 2013 which impact rjes operating plans on a going forward basis in april 2013 we purchased all of the outstanding equity in rjes that was held by others thus we now have sole control over rjesin midfebruary 2013 the client accounts and financial advisors of mk amp co were transferred to rjampa pursuant to our morgan keegan acquisition integration strategies as a result certain rjampa and mk amp co reporting units which have an allocation of both private client group as well as capital markets goodwill were combined we assessed whether these transfers which occurred after our annual goodwill impairment testing date could change our conclusions regarding no impairment of goodwill in the reporting units effected by the transfers based upon our qualitative analysis related to those reporting units we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the combined reporting units equity exceeds the combined reporting units carrying value including goodwill after the effect of such transfers the change in our reportable segments which was effective as of september 30 2013 see notes 1 and 28 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information did not cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as the reporting units which were impacted by this change do not have an allocation of goodwillno other events have occurred since december 31 2012 that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of that dateloss provisionsloss provisions arising from legal proceedingswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount of possible loss within that range if the most likely amount within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possiblewe record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables within our consolidated statements of financial condition the determination of whether a loss is probable and if so the possible loss amount requires significant judgment we consider many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability is adjusted as we consider appropriate any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters we expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurredloss provisions arising from operations of our brokerdealerswe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting and retention purposes these loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned we assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors management considers a number of factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship the former financial advisors overall financial position and our historical collection experience when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balances of such loans are written off and the corresponding allowance is reduced77indexwe also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables client receivables at our brokerdealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients therefore when a receivable is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or brokerdealer price quotationsloan loss provisions arising from operations of rj bank rj bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for discussion of rj banks policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of september 30 2013the current years provision for loan losses includes 56 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators annual shared national credit snc examination the snc exam included a review which represented 80 of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time the impact of the snc exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam we incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual snc exam into our internal ratings methodology the limited number of loans with ratings differences the lengthy period between snc exams and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any years exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings based on these factors however we do not believe the snc exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed rather are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year we do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the snc exam thus based on this policy the results of the annual snc exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known given the relatively high percentage of snc loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio the impact from each annual snc exam may be material to any fiscal years provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous significant meaning more than a one notch classification change or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio the prior years provision for loan losses included 4 million resulting from the impact of the respective periods annual snc exam this prior year exam included a review which was approximately 84 of the held for investment corporate loan portfolio at september 30 2013 the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was 9 billion and an allowance for loan losses of 137 million was recorded against that balance the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 152 of the amortized cost of the loan portfoliothe condition of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our
