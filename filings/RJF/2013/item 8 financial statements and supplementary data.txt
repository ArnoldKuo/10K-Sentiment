bank however based on our current analyses we believe that rjf and rj bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules however the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this form 10k for more informationsince rj bank provides products covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is

international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including levels of economic output interest and inflation rates employment levels consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy these conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including the levels of trading investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits at times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low levels of economic output artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high rates of unemployment and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad these conditions led to several factors in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while select factors indicate signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting financial advisory and other services increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses these periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited  future downgrades of the us sovereign credit rating by one or more of the major credit rating agencies could have material adverse impacts on financial markets and economic conditions in the united states and throughout the world and in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and liquidity concerns about the european unions eu sovereign debt in recent years has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome the eus financial support programs and the possibility exists that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from further eu sovereign debt matters could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity  our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states nonus governments and international agencies the fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict us state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america united states andor canadian factors which are indicative of market conditions include interest rates the rate of unemployment real estate prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earnings16indexlack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionmaintaining an appropriate level of liquidity or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment spending or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations are inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets at the parent company and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions the availability of outside financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on a variety of factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost and availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specificallyif rjfs credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our relationships with clients such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our incremental borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability as such we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in one of our credit agreements and certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information as of september 30 2013 furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec via finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent for the subsidiaries they supervise see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this form 10k for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity riskwe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuer17indexin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing capital requirements which could adversely affect our profitabilityour venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form 10k for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market riskwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealer businesses exposing us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses  we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged in the case of aged securities failed to receive we may under industry regulations purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty also we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity could result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including but not limited to campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans home equity lines of credit and margin and nonpurpose loans collateralized by securities we incur credit risk through our investments which include mbs collateralized mortgage obligations auction rate securities and other municipal securitiesour credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to a natural disaster act of terrorism severe weather event or economic event could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital 18indexdeclines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form 10k for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit riskour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products and on fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiariesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management assets under management balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting market making trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we holdfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded there is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk 19indexour ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients furthermore although we do not hold any eu sovereign debt we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the eu sovereign debt circumstances as a result defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty any such losses in the future may have a material adverse affect on our results of operationswe have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilityour business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginswe may not realize cost savings or other benefits that we anticipated in connection with our acquisition of morgan keeganon april 2 2012 we completed our purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of morgan keegan refer to the discussion of this acquisition in note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k acquisitions of this magnitude pose numerous risks including the failure to achieve anticipated synergies or to realize the projected benefits of the transaction potential loss of clients or key employees and the inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth even though during the year ended september 30 2013 we successfully completed the integration of its businesses into those of rjampa there is no assurance that the net results of this acquisition over time will yield all of the positive benefits anticipated if we are not successful in any or all of these areas there is a risk that our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be materially and adversely affectedregions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan mattersunder the definitive stock purchase agreement dated january 11 2012 entered into by rjf and regions governing our acquisition of morgan keegan the spa regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify rjf with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters rjf is relying on regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the spa with respect to such matters our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified could result in our incurring significant costs for defense settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and our regulatory capital levelssee note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding these indemnification agreementsgrowth of our business could increase costs and regulatory risksintegrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments if and to the extent they arise from time to time our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growth20indexexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction moreover to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business such acquisitions could be of significant size andor complexity this effort together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings or perhaps at all we face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this form 10k for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms hedge funds and others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services in addition the continued development of internet networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure an inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilityour ability to attract and retain qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our employees and financial advisors as such to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified associates including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse affect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquiditythe cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnelmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may currently be working for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining us21indexwe are exposed to operational riskour diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems external events including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center operations processing sites or our branches our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses our financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services operational risk exists in every activity function or unit of our business and can take the form of internal or external fraud employment and hiring practices an error in meeting a professional obligation or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our employees engage in misconduct our businesses would be adversely affected operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption system failures or failed transaction processing third parties with which we do business could

introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the

a discussion of how weather related events could impact our ability to conduct businesswe are exposed to litigation risksmany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability arising in the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our employees could result in substantial liability for us advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor to the extent we fail to know our customers or improperly advise them we could be found liable for losses suffered by such customers which could harm our business our private client group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients investment objectives the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects 23indexin addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operationsas it pertains to morgan

proceedings in this form 10k for a discussion of our legal matters and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form 10k for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal riskthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this form 10k for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars  certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 and

unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective further our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to adequately manage our growth or to effectively manage our risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business we have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form 10kwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to a number of risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks in nonus markets our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations andor our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets additionally a political economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generallywe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion

certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our business25indexrisks related to our regulatory environmentchanges in regulations resulting from either the doddfrank act or any new regulations may affect our businessesthe market and economic conditions over the past several years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry including significant additional legislation and regulation in the us and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures and provide for greater protections to individual consumers and investors certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately while the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act will have on us the financial industry and the economy cannot be known until all such implementing regulations called for under the doddfrank act have been finalized and implementedthe doddfrank act may impact the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which while not currently anticipated to could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our business include but are not limited to the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds outlined in the doddfrank act these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpbadditionally we are closely monitoring regulatory developments related to the volcker rule until the final regulations under the volcker rule are adopted the precise definition of prohibited proprietary trading the scope of any exceptions including those related to market making and hedging activities and the scope of permitted hedge fund and private equity fund investments remain uncertain it is unclear under the proposed rules whether some portion of our market making and related risk mitigation activities as currently conducted will be required to be curtailed or will be otherwise adversely affected in addition the rules if enacted as proposed could prohibit our participation and investment in certain securitization structures and could bar us from sponsoring or investing in certain nonus funds also should regulators not exercise their authority to permit us to hold certain investments including those in illiquid private equity funds beyond the minimum statutory divestment period we could incur substantial losses when we dispose of such investments we may be forced to sell such investments at a substantial discount in the secondary market as a result of both the constrained timing of such sales and the possibility that other financial institutions are likewise liquidating their investments at the same time when the regulations are final we will be in a position to complete a review of our relevant activities and make plans to implement compliance with the volcker rule which will likely not require full conformance until july 2014 subject to extensionsto the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with usthe sec recently adopted amendments most of which were effective october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries however based on our current analyses we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our brokerdealer subsidiaries26indexthe basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitabilityin july 2013 the occ the frb and the fdic released final us basel iii regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establishes a capital conservation buffer and makes selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the rule becomes effective for us january 1 2015 subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both rj bank and rjf the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affectedfailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by the federal banking regulators under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action rjf and rj bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices rjfs and rj banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital risk weightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to riskweighted assets and tier i capital to adjusted assets as defined in the regulations failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and our financial conditionadditionally as rjf is a holding company it depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including among others debt service we are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and the net capital rule of finra which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements in addition our canada based brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company

regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations the sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 with respect to how mutual funds collect and pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry the impact of changes such as those currently proposed cannot be predicted at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our

conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2013 compared with the year ended september 30 2012 we achieved record net revenues of 45 billion a 679 million or 18 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record net revenues and pretax earnings this fiscal year revenues were higher in fiscal year 2013 in part because the results include twelve months of morgan keegan operations as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012 in addition fiscal year 2013 net revenues include a 65 million gain on a proprietary capital investment a 227 million impact to rjf net revenues after noncontrolling interests which further elevated our revenues our pretax income increased 93 million or 20 compared to the prior year to 564 million excluding the acquisition related expenses primarily resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition we generated adjusted pretax income of 644 million a nongaap measure1 a 21 increase over the prior year earnings per share increased 17 over the prior year to 258 per share excluding the acquisition related expenses mentioned above adjusted earnings per share a nongaap measure1  increased 18 to 295 per share all of our operating segments performed well during the year as each achieved record levels of pretax income total client assets under administration were a record 4254 billion at september 30 2013 a 10 increase over the prior year level noninterest expenses increased 553 million or 17 primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of expenses from legacy morgan keegan businesses increases in compensation related expenses information technology expenses and acquisition related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the bank loan loss provisionsignificant milestones achieved in fiscal year 2013 include the midfebruary 2013 transfer of all of the morgan keegan financial advisors and client accounts from the morgan keegan platform to the rjampa platform following that conversion and allowing time for the former morgan keegan financial advisors to become proficient in the use of the rjampa platform in the june 2013 quarter we implemented staff reductions these reductions occurred mainly within our information technology groups where there was significant overlap in historic morgan keegan and rjampa support staffing that we had elected to maintain through the platform conversion date in order to ensure the continued high levels of service to financial advisors and clients while we operated on two different platforms retention levels remain very high for the legacy morgan keegan financial advisors the morgan keegan capital markets businesses were also integrated primarily fixed income and public finance investment banking during the year and further staff reductions were made given these accomplishments as of september 30 2013 our various morgan keegan integration initiatives have been substantially and successfully completed1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the nongaap reconciliation section of this mdampa34indexa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year in addition to the impact of twelve months of morgan keegan operations in the current year compared to six months in the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 29 billion an 18 increase while pretax income increased 7 to 230 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts pretax income was negatively impacted by an increase in commission expenses driven primarily by the increase in corresponding commission revenues as well as an increase in communication and information processing expense client assets under administration of the private client group increased 9 over the prior year to 4026 billion at september 30 2013 the capital markets segment generated net revenues of 927 million a 15 increase while pretax income increased 35 to 102 million we experienced significant increases in institutional fixed income commission revenues merger and acquisition fees and fixed income investment banking revenues equity capital markets commission levels increased as a result of improved equity market conditions results from our equity capital markets investment banking business have been uneven throughout the year characterized by intermittent periods of significant activity and ending the year with strong results our fixed income operations improved overall but were negatively impacted during times of adverse fixed income market conditions these adverse conditions resulted from medium and longer term interest rate volatility which negatively impacted our trading results our asset management segment generated revenues of 293 million a 23 increase while pretax income increased 43 to 96 million assets under management in managed programs increased 31 to a record 56 billion as of september 30 2013 strong net inflows of client assets in managed programs including from legacy mk amp co branches market appreciation and our acquisition of an interest in clarivest contributed to the increase rj bank generated 268 million in pretax income an 11 increase the increase resulted primarily from the significant decrease in the loan loss provision expense and an increase in net interest income the decrease in the loan loss provision expense resulted from an improved credit environment the favorable resolution of certain problem loans and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in average loans outstanding in our nonoperating other segment our results reflect a 6 million increase in our pretax loss this segment includes certain corporate expenses our principal capital and our private equity activities our results were favorably impacted by the sale of our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion in april 2013 the albion investment generated an increase of 18 million in pretax income net of noncontrolling interests we also experienced other less significant increases on other investments in our private equity portfolio those increases were more than offset by additional acquisition and integration related costs incurred from the morgan keegan acquisition and a full years interest expense associated with debt financings executed in march 2012 to finance a portion of the acquisitionour earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 decreased to 349 from 373 in fiscal year 2012 the tax rate decrease primarily resulted from a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings as well as a significant increase in nontaxable income associated with the change in market value of companyowned life insurancewith regard to regulatory changes that could impact our businesses in the future our view of the potential impact to us of future regulations is substantially unchanged by the regulatory activities that occurred during the year based on our review of the doddfrank act and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole however because some of the implementing regulations have yet to be adopted by various regulatory agencies the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain 35indexyear ended september 30 2012 compared with the year ended september 30 2011on april 2 2012 we completed our acquisition of morgan keegan from regions this acquisition expands both our private client and our capital markets businesses morgan keegan brings to us a strong private client business one of the industrys top fixed income and public finance groups and a significant equity capital markets division headquartered in memphis with 57 fullservice offices in 20 states morgan keegan had approximately 3100 employees and over 900 financial advisors as of the date of our purchase 892 of whom have been retained as of september 30 2012 while an addition of this size is a departure from our focus on organic growth supplemented by individual hires and small acquisitions it is not a departure from our overall strategy we have used strategic mergers to grow throughout our history when the timing and pricing were right and most importantly when there was a strong cultural fit and clear path for integration with the addition of morgan keegan we are one of the countrys largest wealth management and investment banking firms affording us even greater ability to support our financial advisors and retail and institutional clientsour fiscal year 2012 results include six months of morgan keegan results and therefore comparisons to prior years are not necessarily meaningful for many of our key financial and operating metrics furthermore integration of both equity and fixed income capital markets began immediately following the closing date which precludes the determination of legacy morgan keegan results in those areas regarding our integration plans our plan is to migrate all the private client financial advisors and client accounts off of the morgan keegan platforms and fully integrate those operations onto our rjampa platform during the second quarter of fiscal year 2013despite the somewhat challenging market conditions during the fiscal year most of our businesses performed relatively well as we accomplished record annual net revenue and net income levels our net revenues of 38 billion represent a 14 increase compared to the prior year excluding net revenues estimated to be attributable to the addition of morgan keegan net revenues increased 2 compared to the prior year all of our segments realized increased revenues over the prior year total client assets under administration increased to 386 billion a 51 increase as compared to the prior year approximately 85 billion of the client assets under administration total are associated with legacy morgan keegan branches our private client group and capital markets segments benefited significantly from the acquisition of morgan keegan noninterest expenses increased 455 million or 16 from the prior year primarily due to the addition of morgan keegan the fiscal year 2012 noninterest expenses include 59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred specifically associated with the morgan keegan acquisition while the prior year includes 41 million pertaining to a nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased the bank loan loss provision decreased 8 million from the prior year reflecting the overall improvement in the credit markets over that periodinclusive of the impact of the acquisition of morgan keegan our pretax income increased 10 million or 2 while our net income increased 18 million or 6 as compared to the prior year after consideration of the acquisition related expenses we incurred and the 2 million of incremental interest expense we incurred as part of the preclosing date execution of our morgan keegan purchase financing strategies we generated adjusted pretax income of 533 million a nongaap measure 1 in fiscal year 2012 after adjusting fiscal year 2011 for the effect of the nonrecurring loss on auction rate securities repurchased we generated adjusted pretax income of 503 million a nongaap measure 1 reflecting an increase in adjusted pretax income a nongaap measure 1 of 30 million or 6 in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior yearour financial results during fiscal year 2012 were most significantly impacted byour private client group segment generated net revenues of 25 billion in fiscal year 2012 a 13 increase over the prior year pretax income of 215 million represents a 2 decrease compared to the prior year the increase in revenues is in large part due to our acquisition of morgan keegan and the high levels of retention of the morgan keegan financial advisors since the acquisition closing date client assets under administration of the private client group increased 44 at september 30 2012 as compared to the prior year to 368 billion which is a result of both the assets brought on by morgan keegan branches and 19 growth in legacy rjf private client assets fiscal year 2012s pretax income was negatively impacted by a significant increase in our technology costs resulting from system enhancements to existing platforms and projects which address numerous regulatory requirements 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the nongaap reconciliation section of this mdampa36indexthe capital markets segment realized a 7 million or 8 decrease in pretax income after adjusting for the adverse impact of the emerging markets businesses the segment generated an increase in pretax income of 5 million or 6 as compared to the prior year this despite very challenging equity capital markets conditions throughout the year as a result of our morgan keegan acquisition we realized substantially increased fixed income institutional sales commissions as well an increase in trading profits compared to the prior year our acquisition of morgan keegan provides us with significantly increased scale in the capital markets industry primarily as it pertains to fixed income operations and public finance weakness in the equity capital markets throughout the year significantly impacted both our institutional equity sales commission levels as well as our equity underwriting fee revenues a decrease in fiscal year 2012 equity capital markets activity in canada which had a particularly strong prior year also had a significant negative impact on our fiscal year 2012 segment resultsour asset management segment generated 67 million of pretax income in fiscal year 2012 a 2 increase compared to the prior year assets under management increased to record levels as of september 30 2012 net inflows of client assets including assets of morgan keegan clients and appreciation in the market values of assets drove the increase rj bank generated a 67 million or 39 increase in pretax income over the prior year to a record 240 million the increase primarily resulted from an increase in net interest revenues resulting from higher average loan balances while maintaining the net interest spread at a level consistent with the prior year and a lower loan loss provision resulting primarily from improved credit characteristics both in our loan portfolio and in the markets as a wholein our nonoperating other segment our results reflect a 127 million pretax loss this segment includes our principal capital and private equity activities which produced pretax income of 15 million after consideration of the attribution to noncontrolling interests generated by income received and positive valuation adjustments arising from certain of our investments in that portfolio the segment also includes 59 million of acquisition and integration related costs we incurred in fiscal year 2012 that were associated with the morgan keegan acquisition as well as 62 million of interest expense the interest expense includes additional interest expense resulting from march 2012 financings to fund a portion of the morgan keegan acquisitionour effective tax rate in fiscal year 2012 decreased to 373 from the prior year rate of 397 primarily resulting from gains realized in fiscal year 2012 as compared to losses in the prior year on our companyowned life insurance investments which are not subject to tax during january 2012 rjfs application to become a bank holding company and a financial holding company was approved by the fed and rj banks conversion to a national bank was approved by the occ these changes became effective february 1 2012 this status better represents the way rj bank has been conducting its business37indexsegmentseffective september 30 2013 we implemented changes in our reportable segments the changes are a result of managements

only held in our rj bank segment but also held in our pcg and capital markets segments which are subject to changes in interest rates these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments an increase in shortterm interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in shortterm interest rates a gradual increase in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this form 10k which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using rj banks own internal assetliability modelbased upon our analysis we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates could result in an increase in our pretax income in the range of approximately 140 million to 170 million over a twelve month period approximately half of such an increase would be attributable to account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase attributable to net interest income reported in both our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2013 and conservative assumptions related to interest rates earned by clients on their cash balances in various interest rate environments the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the vast majority of any incremental benefit to pretax income from a rise in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume that a significant portion of any further incremental increase in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense 40indexthe following table presents our consolidated average interestearning asset and liability balances interest income and expense

client accounts from the mk amp co platform were transferred to and integrated with the rjampa platformsecurities commissions and fees increased 399 million or 19 a significant portion of this

of 4026 billion in the pcg segment increased 349 billion or 9 as compared to september 30 2012 primarily resulting from equity market appreciation in the usclient account and service fee revenues increased 13 million or 9 over the prior year the increase primarily results from an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program balances in this program increased primarily as a result of the transfer of mk amp co client accounts to the raymond james program additional mk amp co client accounts also resulted in an increase in service fee income which increased as a result of the additional client account volume in addition we realized an increase in fees resulting from assets invested in alternative investment funds44indexmutual fund

all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute in addition to an increase in the mutual fund assets on which these fees are generally paid during the past year we implemented changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements the offsetting increased costs we

integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs further increasing this revenuepartially offsetting the increases in revenues described in the preceding two paragraphs client transaction fees decreased 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting over the past year to a ntf program and an april 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain nonmanaged feebased accounts under the mutual fund ntf program we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs other revenues increased by 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of spreads earned on crosscurrency transactions within our canadian operations total segment revenues increased 18 the portion of total

september 30 2012the amount of net interest in the pcg segment was nearly unchanged from the prior year level increases in client margin balances and client cash balances outstanding over the year were nearly completely offset by further decreases in interest rates as a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2013 there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from the client cash balance increase as the interest spread earned on client balances were at historically low levels refer to the discussion of how the pretax income of this segment could be favorably impacted by a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates in the net interest section of this mdampa noninterest expenses increased 430 million or 19 over the prior year sales commission expense increased 275 million or 18 consistent with the 19 increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 61 million or 14 this increase resulted primarily from the impact of a full year of salaries and benefits expense associated with the increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of the morgan keegan associates communications and information processing expense increased 49 million or 43 computer software development costs and other information technology related costs which include consulting expenses increased over 42 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms costs associated with operating two platforms for a portion of the year additional reporting requirements including regulatory requirements and expenses associated with omnibus arrangements refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above occupancy and equipment expense increased 18 million or 19 primarily due to a full years rent and other facility related expenses associated with the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition clearance and other expenses increased 27 million or 38 these expense increases can generally be attributed to clearing and floor brokerage expenses resulting from the additional volume of client accounts and transactions arising from the morgan keegan acquisition growth in our legacy operations and the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between segments than within the historic mk amp co operations which impacts prior year comparisons 45indexyear ended september 30 2012 compared with the year ended september 30 2011  private client groupnet revenues in fiscal year

239 million in fiscal year 2012 or 13 over the prior year amount a significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of morgan keegan on april 2 2012 which brought over 900 financial advisors into pcg over 95 of whom have been retained as of september 30 2012 overall we have realized an 183 increase in the number of pcg financial advisors as of september 30 2012 as compared to

increased 25 million in fiscal year 2012 or 20 over the prior year the portion of these revenues generated from morgan keegan clients is 10 million of the remaining increase the primary component is the result of an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program the fees increased as a result of higher balances in the program mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 26 million in fiscal year 2012 or 24 over the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund networking and omnibus fees ems fees and ntf program revenues all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during the past year we have been implementing a change in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements the largest portion of this conversion occurred midway through fiscal year 2011 excluding the impact of the revenues generated from morgan keegan clients these revenues increased 23 million or 21 as compared to the prior year the morgan keegan client mutual fund positions will be eligible for our omnibus program following conversion to the rjampa platformpartially offsetting the increases in revenues described above client transaction fees decreased 13 million in fiscal year 2012 or 37 compared to the prior

increase in assets in feebased accounts over the preceding year balances resulted from the addition of the assets in the feebased accounts of morgan keegan pcg net interest revenues increased 13 million in fiscal year 2012 or 18 over the prior year primarily resulting from an increase in client margin balances there was a decrease in net interest earned on client cash balances as more of these funds are being swept into our multibank sweep program where a fee is earned by pcg instead of interest a portion of the increase in client margin balances resulted from the addition of the balances associated with morgan keegan clients46indexnoninterest expenses increased 297 million in fiscal year 2012 or 15 over the prior year sales commission expense increased 159 million or 12 generally consistent with the increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 76 million or 22 the increase primarily results from increases in

morgan keegan were immediately integrated into rjampas operations on the date of acquisition other morgan keegan capital markets businesses were integrated into rjampa over time and were completed by midfebruary 2013 a full year of morgan keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the current year results as compared to only six months in fiscal year 2012 impacting comparisons of our legacy capital markets results especially fixed income operations to our current results48indexour fixed income revenues were significantly higher for the current year as compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of a full years morgan keegan results the combination of our former fixed income operations with morgan keegans fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business net revenues increased by 123 million or 15 total institutional sales commissions increased 15 over the prior year equity institutional sales commissions increased 17 million or 7 primarily due to improved equity market conditions the 60 million or 22 increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions over the prior year is primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations after the morgan keegan acquisition and the inclusion of twelve months of the combined entities operations in the current year as compared to only six months in the prior year our significantly larger public finance fixed income operations as a result of the morgan keegan acquisition favorably impacted both our investment banking revenues and our securities commissions and fees the number of lead and comanaged equity underwritings as well as merger amp acquisition transactions during the current year increased significantly in our us operations as compared to the prior year in the latter part of the first quarter of our fiscal 2013 concerns related to the then pending fiscal cliff crisis had at least in part a favorable impact on our equity capital markets business as underwriting and merger and acquisition activity improved significantly as issuers sought to complete certain equity transactions in advance of any anticipated tax law changes the activity levels experienced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 slowed considerably thereafter until a very active fourth quarter for the year the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of merger and acquisition fees were technology services energy technology financial services healthcare and general industrials capital markets activities in our canadian operations have remained sluggish throughout the year continuing to reflect the adverse market conditions which existed throughout the prior fiscal year particularly in the businesses in which we focus such as natural resourcesthe primary contributor to our fixed income investment banking revenues is our public finance investment banking operations the volume of our lead and comanaged public finance underwritings increased significantly over the prior year this favorable comparison is in part due to the positive impact of the inclusion of the public finance operations we acquired from morgan keegan in our results for an entire yearthe decrease in tax credit syndication fee revenues results from an increase in the amount of fee revenues that have been deferred to be recognized at later dates upon completion of certain revenue recognition criteria the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year is slightly higher than in the prior yeardespite our increase in fixed income trading capacity resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition our trading profit results for the year while positive overall have been unfavorably impacted by adverse conditions in the municipal fixed income market this market has been impacted during the current year by a number of factors municipal fixed income markets were negatively impacted during first quarter by discussions and rumors regarding potential changes in the tax laws pertaining to limits or caps on the taxexempt advantages of municipal fixed income instruments the fiscal cliff in response to these uncertainties interest rates on municipal securities increased during december 2012 which negatively impacted our trading results during the third quarter the 10year benchmark interest rate increased over 60 basis points in a very short period of time may through june 30 2013 resulting in very little demand for municipal fixed income securities in the market and valuation losses on municipal securities held in inventory which negatively impacted our third quarter trading results during the fourth quarter interest rates retreated somewhat back to their early may 2013 levels and our trading results were strong especially in municipal products during that period all of these factors considered in conjunction with what were strong municipal fixed income trading results in the prior year resulted in unfavorable trading profits in yearoveryear comparisons49indexnoninterest expenses increased 98 million or 13 over the prior year primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 41 million or 22 which is correlated with the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 15 and includes the impact of the shift to a higher proportion of commissions being fixed income sales which are paid higher commissions including certain retentionrelated expenses implemented as part of the morgan keegan acquisition administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 39 million or 10 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel from the morgan keegan acquisition communications and information processing expense increased 7 million or 13 as a result of new technology initiatives and a full year of morgan keegan expenses goodwill impairment expense associated with rjes of 7 million see discussion below and a 6 million increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities discussed below contributed to the increase in other expense these increases are partially offset by a decrease in clearance and other expense of 8 million or 18 the decrease results primarily from the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between the capital markets and the pcg segments within rjampa as compared to the historic mk amp co operations which favorably impact prior year comparisons refer to the pcg results of operations herein for a discussion of an offsetting unfavorable prior year comparison within that segmentduring the second quarter we incurred impairment expense associated with the rjes operations of 69 million however since we did not own 100 of rjes as of march 31 2013 23 million of this expense is attributable to others and is included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests amount attributable to others therefore the net impact of this goodwill impairment on the pretax results after consideration of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests is 46 million refer to the goodwill section of this item 7 and note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on this goodwill impairment expenselosses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds nearly all of these losses are attributable to others and are therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on the consolidation of vies  noncontrolling interests include the consolidation of rjes for periods prior to april 2013 the period in which we acquired the interests previously held by others as well as the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which impacts other revenue interest expense and losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies as described in the previous paragraph by including the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own total segment expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests increased by 2 million as compared to the prior year in part as a result of the portions of the rjes goodwill impairment expense attributable to others as well as the increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by viesyear ended september 30 2012 compared with the year ended september 30 2011  capital marketspretax income in fiscal year 2012 in the capital markets segment decreased 7 million or 8 as compared to the prior year this segment includes the activities of our emerging markets businesses whose operations generated a 7 million pretax loss in fiscal year 2012 which is 12 million worse than the pretax income generated by those operations in fiscal year 2011 certain of the capital markets businesses of the morgan keegan brokerdealer we acquired on april 2 2012 were immediately integrated into rjampas operations on the date of acquisition other morgan keegan capital markets businesses are being integrated into rjampa over time morgan keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in the fiscal year 2012 results therefore comparisons of our legacy capital markets operations especially fixed income operations to our current operations are not meaningful our plan is to fully integrate all of the historic morgan keegan capital markets businesses into rjampa by the end of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2013the weakness in the equity capital markets negatively impacted our results our fixed income results reflect significant improvement during the third and fourth quarter primarily driven by the acquisition of morgan keegan the combination of our former fixed income operations with morgan keegans fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business 50indexnet revenues in fiscal year 2012 increased by 114 million or 16 primarily resulting from a 139 million or 109 increase in institutional fixed income sales commissions a 26 million or 108 increase in trading profits a 21 million or 130 increase in fixed income investment banking revenues and a 9 million increase in private placement fees these revenue increases were partially offset by a 40 million or 35 decrease in equity underwriting fees a 31 million or 12 decrease in institutional equity sales commissions a 13 million or 16 decrease in merger and acquisitions fees and a 4 million or 12 decrease in tax credit fund syndication fees lingering concerns over the eu debt crisis and the us economy had a negative impact on the capital markets for most of fiscal year 2012 fixed income sales commissions increased over the prior year primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations the increase in fixed income investment banking revenues was primarily the result of the increase in underwriting fees of 23 million which arose from the morgan keegan fixed income public finance operations we acquired although equity market levels at the end of fiscal year 2012 finished at higher levels than the prior year the market for public offerings during fiscal year 2012 has been erratic the number of lead and comanaged underwritings during the year increased in our us operations and decreased significantly in our canadian operations fiscal year 2011 was a particularly strong year for our canadian equity capital markets operations but market conditions in the industries in which they are concentrated energy and mining have slowed significantly since the prior year equity underwriting fees arising from our operations in emerging markets decreased 15 million in fiscal year 2012 as compared to the prior year fiscal year 2011 revenues include fees arising from our argentine joint venture which acted as an advisor to institutional clients in several significant transactions during that prior year resulting in the unfavorable comparison to fiscal year 2012 our tax credit fund syndication subsidiary sold approximately 596 million in tax credit fund partnership interests to investors during fiscal year 2012 a decrease compared to the record volume of 616 million sold in fiscal year 2011 trading profits for fiscal year 2012 increased 26 million or 108 as compared to the prior year the yearoveryear increase results in part from the acquisition of morgan keegan as trading profits arise primarily from fixed income products after our acquisition of morgan keegan we have more fixed income trading professionals then we had prior to the acquisition providing us a greater platform from which to generate trading profits to support the increased number of trading professionals our inventories of fixed income products has also increasednoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2012 increased 132 million or 21 over the prior year primarily driven by the addition of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 47 million or 34 which is directly correlated to the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 28 and includes the shift to a higher percentage of fixed income sales administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 50 million or 15 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition a full year of consolidation of rjes which became effective when we acquired a controlling interest in that subsidiary in april 2011 and to a lesser extent the annual increase in salary and benefits costs the increase in clearance and other expense primarily resulted from an increase of approximately 15 million in clearance expenses arising from the larger combined fixed income operations morgan keegans allocation methodology and 2 million of expense in fiscal year 2012 arising from the amortization of various intangible assets which arose as a result of the morgan keegan acquisitionnoncontrolling interests represent the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which also impacts other revenue interest expense and other expenses within this segment see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details as well as the impact of our consolidation of rjes and reflects the portion of these consolidated entities which we do

in investment subadvisory fee expense is directly related to the increase in advisory fees paid to the external managers associated with certain assets included within the uma and raymond james

increase of 11 million or 3 in net revenues and a 23 million or 90 decrease in the provision for loan losses offset by a 7 million or 9 increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses the 11 million increase in net revenues was attributable to a 17 million increase in net interest income partially offset by a 6 million decrease in other income  net interest income increased 17 million or 5 primarily as a result of a 13 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets this increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 11 billion increase in average loans as well as increases in both average investments and cash the significant increase in average loans resulted from a strong corporate lending market including our canadian lending operation which began in late february 2012 and growth in the recently introduced securities based lending product the yield on interestearning banking assets decreased to 334 from 361 due to declines in both the loan and investment yields the loan portfolio yield decreased to 386 from 420 due to a reduction in the corporate loan portfolio yield resulting from tightened credit spreads and the repricing of existing loans at lower rates in addition the yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined as a result of adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates as well as lower rates on new production primarily as a result of the decrease in the yield of the average interestearning assets the net interest margin decreased to 325 from 350corresponding to the increase in interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 12 billion to 93 billion  the decrease in other income was primarily due to a 7 million decrease in foreign currency gainslosses from prior year levels a 2 million loss in the valuation of rj banks bankowned life insurance and a prior year gain of 2 million resulting from a settlement with a residential mortgage loan servicer these were partially offset by a 3 million reduction in otherthantemporary impairment otti losses on our available for sale securities portfolio and a 2 million increase in

delinquent loans these credit characteristics reflected the positive impact from improved economic conditions net loan chargeoffs decreased 11 million or 45 to 13 million 58indexthe 7 million increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to a 3 million or 18 increase in compensation and benefits expenses related to staff additions to support

our securities based lending businessyear ended september 30 2012 compared to the year ended september 30 2011  rj bankpretax income generated by the rj bank segment increased 67 million or 39 as compared to the prior year the improvement in pretax income was primarily attributable to an increase of 67 million or 25 in net revenues and an 8 million or 23 decrease in the provision for loan losses offset by an 8 million or 13 increase in other noninterest expenses net revenue was positively impacted by a 51 million increase in net interest income 6 million less in otti losses on our available for sale securities portfolio and an improvement of 8 million in foreign currency transaction gains on canadian dollar denominated loans in the corporate loan portfolio  net interest income increased 57 million over the prior year excluding the impact of a 6 million correction recorded in the prior year primarily as a result of a 12 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets this increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 12 billion increase in average corporate loans while there were increases in the small business administration sba and consumer loan portfolios as well as cash and investments these were largely offset by a decrease in residential mortgage loans the yield on interestearning banking assets of 361 was consistent with 360 in the prior year the average loan portfolio yield was 420 as compared to 425 in the prior year the loan portfolio yield decreased due to a decline in the yield on the residential mortgage loan portfolio resulting from adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates which offset an increase in the corporate loan portfolio yield average corporate loans outstanding include the impact of the purchase of 400 million of canadian loans on february 29 2012 the net interest margin increased 007 from the prior year to 350 due to a small increase in the yield on earning assets and a small decrease in the average cost of funds corresponding to the increase in interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 11 billion to 81 billion  the provision for loan losses during the year was positively impacted by a reduction in both campi and cre nonperforming loans improved credit characteristics of certain problem loans and the reduction of the balance

see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our significant accounting estimates those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our other comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosures71indexfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain cmos certain mbs and our derivative instruments and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital activities certain nonagency cmos certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2013 and 2012 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described below72indextrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securitiestrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieswhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsthe fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities which include ars we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyderivative contractswe enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our legacy operations are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument73indexwe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through rjss rjss enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with customers of rjampa for every derivative transaction rjss enters into with a customer it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the customer transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges available for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities debt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most senior nonagency securities at september 30 2013 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy74indexfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with third parties andor discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the partnership as provided by the fund manager investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyother

who were at onetime associated with mk amp co participate in deferred compensation plans the balances associated with these plans are invested in certain marketable securities that are held by rjf

level 1 of the fair value hierarchythe canadian financial institution term deposits are recorded at cost which approximates market value these investments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy certain other investments in financial instruments held by rj ltd include nonagency abs that have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation and are classified

significant management judgment of our total goodwill of 295 million 230 million arose from our fiscal year 2012 acquisition of morgan keegan see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding the morgan keegan acquisition and as of september 30 2013 is part of rjampa 33 million arose from our acquisition of goepel mcdermid inc now rj ltd which occurred during fiscal year 2001 30 million arose from our acquisition of roney amp co now part of rjampa which occurred during fiscal year 1999 and 2 million arose from our acquisition of howe barnes which occurred in april 2011 and is now a part of rjampa this goodwill was allocated to reporting units 174 million is included in the pcg segment and 121 million is included in the capital markets segment goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2012 we elected to not exercise the option to perform a qualitative assessment but instead to perform a quantitative assessment of the equity value of each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill in our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit under the market approach we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges and the book value of comparable transactions the estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows in estimating future cash flows a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit or for the nine month period since the closing date for morgan keegan reporting units were compiled future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections the cash flows were discounted at the reporting units estimated cost of equity which was derived through application of the capital asset pricing model the valuation result from the market approach was dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings finally significant management judgment was applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach which resulted in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments as of december 31 2012 we concluded that with the exception of our rjes reporting unit there was no other impairment of goodwill and the fair values of the equity of the reporting units to be substantially in excess of their book carrying values which include the allocated goodwill see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a summary of certain key assumptions utilized in our quantitative analysis performed as of december 31 2012 the assumptions and estimates utilized in determining the fair value of reporting unit equity are sensitive to changes including but not limited to a decline in overall market conditions adverse business trends and changes in regulations 76indexwe concluded the goodwill associated with the rjes reporting unit to be completely impaired the impairment expense recorded in the year ended september 30 2013 of 69 million is included in other expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the annual testing date our share of this impairment expense after consideration of the noncontrolling interests amounts to 46 million rjes is an entity that provides research coverage on european corporations as well as having sales and trading operations the decline in value of rjes is primarily due to the continuing economic slowdown experienced in europe which has had a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended march 31 2013 which impact rjes operating plans on a going forward basis in april 2013 we purchased all of the outstanding equity in rjes that was held by others thus we now have sole control over rjesin midfebruary 2013 the client accounts and financial advisors of mk amp co were transferred to rjampa pursuant to our morgan keegan acquisition integration strategies as a result certain rjampa and mk amp co reporting units which have an allocation of both private client group as well as capital markets goodwill were combined we assessed whether these transfers which occurred after our annual goodwill impairment testing date could change our conclusions regarding no impairment of goodwill in the reporting units effected by the transfers based upon our qualitative analysis related to those reporting units we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the combined reporting units equity exceeds the combined reporting units carrying value including goodwill after the effect of such transfers the change in our reportable segments which was effective as of september 30 2013 see notes 1 and 28 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information did not cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as the reporting units which were impacted by this change do not have an allocation of goodwillno other events have occurred since december 31 2012 that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of that dateloss provisionsloss provisions arising from legal proceedingswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount of possible loss within that range if the most likely amount within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possiblewe record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables within our consolidated statements of financial condition the determination of whether a loss is probable and if so the possible loss amount requires significant judgment we consider many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability is adjusted as we consider appropriate any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters we expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurredloss provisions arising from operations of our brokerdealerswe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting and retention purposes these loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned we assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts from former employees or independent contractors management considers a number of factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship the former financial advisors overall financial position and our historical collection experience when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balances of such loans are written off and the corresponding allowance is reduced77indexwe also record reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables client receivables at our brokerdealer subsidiaries are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients therefore when a receivable is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or brokerdealer price quotationsloan loss provisions arising from operations of rj bank rj bank provides an allowance for loan losses which reflects our continuing evaluation of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio refer to note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for discussion of rj banks policies regarding the allowance for loan losses and refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of september 30 2013the current years provision for loan losses includes 56 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators annual shared national credit snc examination the snc exam included a review which represented 80 of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time the impact of the snc exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam we incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual snc exam into our internal ratings methodology the limited number of loans with ratings differences the lengthy period between snc exams and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any years exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings based on these factors however we do not believe the snc exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed rather are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year we do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the snc exam thus based on this policy the results of the annual snc exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known given the relatively high percentage of snc loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio the impact from each annual snc exam may be material to any fiscal years provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous significant meaning more than a one notch classification change or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio the prior years provision for loan losses included 4 million resulting from the impact of the respective periods annual snc exam this prior year exam included a review which was approximately 84 of the held for investment corporate loan portfolio at september 30 2013 the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was 9 billion and an allowance for loan losses of 137 million was recorded against that balance the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 152 of the amortized cost of the loan portfoliothe condition of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bankincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax

market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence levelwe apply the feds market risk rule mrr for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios the mrr requires us to extend the calculation of var for all of our trading portfolios including equity and derivative instruments 80indexto calculate var we use historical simulation this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes the simulation is based upon daily market data for the previous twelve months var is reported at a 99 confidence level based on a oneday time horizon this means that we could expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by the var estimates only once in every 100 trading days or about 25 times a year on average over the course of time we have chosen the historical period of twelve months to be representative of the current interest rate and equity markets we utilize stress testing to complement our var analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios var results are indicative of relatively recent changes in general interest rates and equity markets and are not designed to capture historical stress periods beyond the twelve month historical period back testing procedures performed include comparing projected var results to our daily trading losses we then verify that the number of times that daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99 confidence level during the year ended september 30 2013 the reported daily loss in our trading portfolio exceeded the predicted var one timeshould markets suddenly become more volatile actual trading losses may exceed the var results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days accordingly management applies additional controls including position limits a daily review of trading results review of the status of aged inventory independent controls on pricing monitoring of concentration risk and review of issuer ratings as well as stress testing during volatile markets we may choose to pare our trading inventories

involves a number of assumptions and approximations while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var and

other investments those earning assets are funded by rj banks obligations to customers ie customer deposits based on its current earning asset portfolio rj bank is subject to interest rate risk the current economic environment has led to an extended period of low market interest rates as a result the majority of rj banks adjustable rate assets and liabilities have experienced a reduction in interest rate yields and costs that reflect these very low market interest rates during the year rj bank has focused its interest rate risk analysis on the risk of market interest rates rising rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both in a range of interest rate scenariosone of the objectives of rj banks asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis repricing gap analysis and limits and economic value of equity simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right but not the obligation to repay before the scheduled maturity to ensure that rj bank is within its limits established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios rj bank utilizes an internally developed assetliability model using standard industry software to analyze the available data the model calculates changes in net interest income by calculating interest income and interest expense from existing assets and liabilities using current repricing prepayment and volume assumptions various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios would have on net interest income the following

ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activitieswe are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performanceour client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure associated with our pcg segment results primarily from customer margin accounts which are monitored daily and are collateralized we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will renege on the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss however most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed we are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the us government or its agencies receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made including underwritings may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses we seek to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty the size of the position or commitment the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments

in the critical accounting estimates section of this item 7 and note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as rj banks loan portfolio is segregated into five portfolio segments likewise the allowance for loan losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as followscampi loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre construction loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as described above in addition project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segmentresidential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or other types of nontraditional loan products loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentconsumer loans in this segment are primarily secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of securities which will bring the loan current and may bring the loan within the prescribed ltv guidelines in evaluating credit risk rj bank considers trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors during fiscal year 2013 corporate profit levels have improved but have remained weak as compared to historic levels unemployment rates have declined but remain high retail sales continue to be sluggish and credit quality trends while improved in some sectors remain somewhat tenuous all of these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance however during fiscal year 2013 corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt the volatility in residential home values in certain geographies has continued to have an impact on residential mortgage loan performance these factors all have the capacity to negatively impact our provision for loan losses and net chargeoffs85indexseveral factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september 30 2013 including the risk profile of the portfolios net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio rj bank further stratified the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio based upon updated ltv estimates with higher reserve percentages

approximately 90 of the residential loans are fully documented loans and 98 of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is owneroccupant borrowers for their primary or second home residences of which approximately 85 is for their primary residences substantially all of rj banks residential loans are arm loans approximately 20 of the first lien residential mortgage loans are arms with interestonly payments based on a fixed rate for an initial period of the loan typically three to five years then become fully amortizing subject to annual and lifetime interest rate caps certain of our originated 15 or 30year fixedrate mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market rj banks consumer loan portfolio is comprised primarily of loans fully collateralized by clients marketable securities and represents approximately 6 of rj banks total loan portfolio the underwriting policy for rj banks consumer loans primarily includes a review of collateral including ltv with a limited review of repayment history and the debttoincome ratio of the borrowerwhile rj bank has chosen not to participate in any governmentsponsored loan modification programs its loan modification policy does take into consideration some of the programs parameters and supports every effort to assist borrowers within the guidelines of safety and soundness in general rj bank considers the qualification terms outlined in the governmentsponsored programs as well as the affordability test and other factors rj bank retains flexibility to determine the appropriate modification structure and required documentation to support the borrowers current financial situation before approving a modification short sales are also used by rj bank to mitigate credit lossescorporate loan portfoliorj banks corporate loan portfolio is diversified among a number of industries in both the us and canada and comprised of project finance real estate loans commercial lines of credit and term loans the majority of which are participations in snc or other large syndicated loans rj bank is sometimes involved in the syndication of the loan at inception and some of these loans have been purchased in the secondary trading markets as the process for evaluating the sncs or other large syndications is consistent with the process for the other corporate loans in the portfolio there is no additional credit risk with syndicated loans as compared to any other loan in rj banks corporate loan portfolio in addition all corporate loans are subject to rj banks regulatory review the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans regardless of the source all loans are independently underwritten to rj bank credit policies and are subject to loan committee approval and credit quality is monitored on an ongoing basis by rj banks corporate lending staff rj bank credit policies include criteria related to ltv limits based upon property type single borrower loan limits loan term and structure parameters including guidance on leverage debt service coverage ratios and debt repayment ability industry concentration limits secondary sources of repayment and other criteria a large portion of rj banks corporate loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts more than half of rj banks corporate borrowers are public companies rj banks corporate loans are generally secured by all assets of the borrower and in some instances are secured by mortgages on specific real estate in a limited number of transactions loans in the portfolio are extended on an unsecured basis there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio risk monitoring processanother component of the credit risk strategy at rj bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential consumer and corporate credit exposures there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio89indexresidential mortgage and consumer loanswe track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in rj banks residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios the qualitative factors include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores occupancy ie owner occupied second home or investment property level of documentation loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size and loan policy exceptions these qualitative measures while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any quantitative adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates in addition to historical loss rates one other quantitative factor utilized for the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio is updated ltv ratiosrj bank obtains the most recently available information generally on a quarter lag to estimate current ltv ratios on the individual loans in the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio current ltv ratios are estimated based on the initial appraisal obtained at the time of origination adjusted using relevant market indices for housing price changes that have occurred since origination the value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to change in the condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within current valuation indices and other factorsresidential mortgage loans with estimated ltvs between 100 and 120 represent 5 of the residential mortgage loan portfolio and residential mortgage loans with estimated ltvs in excess of 120 represent 2 of the residential mortgage loan portfolio the current average estimated ltv is approximately 65 for the total residential mortgage loan portfolio credit risk management utilizes this data in conjunction with delinquency statistics loss experience and economic circumstances to establish appropriate allowance for loan losses for the residential mortgage loan portfolio which is based upon an estimate for the probability of default and loss given default for each homogeneous class of loansthe marketable collateral securing rj banks securitiesbased loans within the consumer loan portfolio is monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure rj banks loans are adequately secured resulting in minimizing its credit riskresidential mortgage loan delinquency levels are elevated by historical standards at rj

average for over 30 day delinquencies of 919 as most recently reported by the fed rj banks significantly lower delinquency rate as compared to its peers is the result of both our uniform underwriting

bank in accordance with regulation d of the federal reserve act which requires depository institutions to maintain minimum average reserve balances against its depositsrepurchase agreements and other collateralized financingswe purchase securities under shortterm agreements to resell reverse repurchase agreements additionally we sell securities under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements both reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financings and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest our policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under the reverse repurchase agreements to ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient the securities are valued daily and cash is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when contractually required these reverse repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations other collateralized financings include secured call loans receivable held by rj ltd these financings represent loans of excess cash to financial institutions which are fully collateralized by canadian treasury bills or provincial obligations and bear interest at call loan ratesfinancial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased and fair valuefinancial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date106indexin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurementslevel 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securitieslevel 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mortgagebacked securities mbs our derivative instruments and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our proprietary capital activities certain nonagency cmos certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include auction rate securities ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrumentwe offset our long and short positions for a particular security recorded at fair value as part of our trading instruments long positions and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased short positions when the long and short positions have identical committee on uniform security identification procedures numbers cusipsvaluation techniques the fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2013 and 2012 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makers107indexthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading instruments are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries these instruments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period net incomewhen available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of our trading securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieswhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsthe fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities interest on the rjf afs securities is recognized in interest income on an accrual basis for the rj bank afs securities discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated remaining life of the security a combination of the level factor and straightline methods is used for such securities the effect of which does not differ materially from the effective interest method when a principal reduction occurs on a rj bank afs security any related premium or discount is recognized as an adjustment to yield in the results of operations in the period in which the principal reduction occursrealized gains and losses on sales of any rjf afs securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold108indexunrealized gains or losses on any rjf afs securities except for those that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are recorded through other comprehensive income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aocifor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at a reporting period end we make an assessment whether such securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered in order to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the securitywe intend and have the ability to hold the rjf afs securities to maturity we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these available for sale securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis those securities whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired and are written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in shareholders equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security for any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidity expected principal and interest cash flows on the impaired debt security are discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the time of acquisition the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment otti recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securitythe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is most representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for all except three senior nonagency securities at september 30 2013 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor the one subordinated nonagency security in the rj bank afs securities portfolio as of september 30 2013 and 2012 we estimate its fair value by utilizing discounted cash flow analyses using observable market data where available as well as our own unobservable inputs the unobservable inputs utilized in our valuation reflect our own suppositions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing this security including those about future delinquencies loss severities defaults prepayments and discount rates this security is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy109indexars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were at one time able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyderivative contractswe enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate customer transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account these derivatives are accounted for as trading account assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition any realized or unrealized gains or losses are recorded in net trading profits within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income with any interest earned thereon recorded in interest income the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted bycounterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of these interest rate derivative contracts is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelswe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through nonbrokerdealer subsidiaries either raymond james financial products llc or morgan keegan capital services llc collectively referred to as the raymond james matched book swap subsidiaries or rjss the only difference in the swap businesses conducted by these two subsidiary entities is that they utilize different third party financial institutions to facilitate the offsetting transaction rjss enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with customers of rjampa for every derivative transaction rjss enters into with a customer it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the customer transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution any collateral required to be exchanged under these derivative contracts is administered directly by the customer and the third party financial institution rjss does not hold any collateral or administer any collateral transactions related to these instruments we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rjss recognizes revenue on derivative transactions on the transaction date computed as the present value of the expected cash flows rjss expects to receive from the third party financial institution over the life of the derivative contract the difference between the present value of these cash flows at the date of inception and the gross amount potentially received is accreted to revenue over the term of the contract the revenue from these transactions is included within other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income rj bank enters into threemonth forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of aoci with such balance impacting earnings in the event the net investment is sold or substantially liquidated gains and losses on the undesignated derivative instruments as well as amounts representing hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at each reporting period using a method that is based on changes in forward rates the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the beginning balance of the foreign net investment at the inception of the hedging relationship and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the terms of the hedging instrument and hypothetical derivative match at inception there is no expected ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the forward exchange contracts is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument 110indexthe fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy

accountsbrokerage client receivables include receivables from the clients of our brokerdealer and asset management subsidiaries the receivables from brokerdealer clients are principally for amounts due on cash and margin transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by the clients the receivables from asset management clients are primarily for accrued investment advisory fees both the receivables from the asset management and brokerdealer clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts when a brokerdealer receivable is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or brokerdealer price quotations securities beneficially owned by customers including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions are not reflected in our consolidated statements of financial conditionwe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting and retention purposes these loans

analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards based upon the nature of these financing receivables we do not analyze this asset on a portfolio segment or class basis further the aging of this receivable balance is not a determinative factor in computing our allowance for doubtful accounts as concerns regarding the recoverability of these loans primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts related to former employees or independent contractors management considers a number of factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship the former financial advisors overall financial position and our historical collection experience when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balance of such loan is writtenoff and the corresponding allowance is reduced we present the outstanding balance of loans to financial advisors on our consolidated statements of financial condition net of their applicable allowances for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts balance associated

sba section 7a loans and accounts for these loans in accordance with the policy for loans held for sale rj bank then aggregates sba loans with similar characteristics into pools for securitization and sale to the secondary market individual loans may be sold prior to securitization the determination of the fair value of the sba loans depend upon their intended disposition the fair value of the sba loans to be individually sold are determined based upon their committed sales price the fair value of loans to be aggregated into pools for securitization which are committed to be sold are determined based upon third party price quotes the fair value of all other sba loans are determined using a third party pricing service the prices for the sba loans other than those committed to be individually

restructuring is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring tdr if we for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties grant a concession we would not otherwise consider in tdrs for all classes of loans the concessions granted such as interest rate reductions generally do not reflect current market conditions for a new loan of similar risk made to another borrower in similar financial circumstances other concessions for campi cre and cre construction loans may also include the reduction of the guarantors liability for those restructurings of first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage loans which may reflect current market conditions the concessions granted by rj bank are generally interest capitalization principal forbearance release of liability

accrual status when there has been a sustained period of six months of satisfactory performance campi cre and cre construction tdrs have generally been partially chargedoff and therefore remain on nonaccrual status until the loan is fully resolvedimpaired loansloans in all classes are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that rj bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest on a loan when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired rj bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration reasons for the delay the borrowers prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed for individual loans identified as impaired impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate and taking into consideration the factors described below in relation to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses except that as a practical expedient rj bank measures impairment based on the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent impaired loans include all corporate nonaccrual loans all residential mortgage nonaccrual loans for which a chargeoff had previously been recorded and all loans which have been modified in tdrs interest income on impaired loans is recognized consistently with the recognition policy of nonaccrual loansallowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitmentsrj bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when rj bank believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance rj bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflects the assessment of risk considering all available information in developing this assessment rj bank relies on estimates and exercises judgment in evaluating credit risk the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available depending on changes in circumstances future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan lossesthis allowance for loan loss is comprised of two components allowances calculated based on formulas for homogenous classes of loans collectively evaluated for impairment and specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment these homogeneous classes are a result of managements disaggregation of the loan portfolio and are comprised of the previously mentioned classes campi cre cre construction residential first mortgage residential home equity and consumerthe loans within the campi cre and cre construction classes are assigned to one of several internal loan grades based upon the respective loans credit characteristics the loans within the residential first mortgage residential home equity and consumer classes are assigned loan grades equivalent to the loan classifications utilized by bank regulators dependent on their respective likelihood of loss we assign each loan grade for all loan classes an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that grade the allowance for loan losses for all nonimpaired loans is then calculated based on the reserve percentage assigned to the respective loans class and grade the allowance for loan losses for all impaired loans except those nonaccrual residential first mortgage loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on an individual evaluation of impairment as previously described in the impaired loans section above114indexthe qualitative and quantitative factors taken into consideration when assigning the loan grades and allowance percentages to the loans within the campi cre and cre construction loan classes include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values trends in delinquencies volume and terms changes in geographic distribution updated loantovalue ltv ratios lending policies experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff local regional national and international economic conditions concentrations of credit risk past loss history shared national credit snc reviews and examination results from bank regulators loan grades for individual campi cre and cre construction loans are derived from analyzing two aspects of the risk factors in a particular loan the obligor rating and the facility collateral rating the obligor rating relates to a borrowers probability of default and the facility rating is utilized to estimate the anticipated loss given default these two ratings which are based on rj banks most recent two years historical loss data or historical longterm industry loss rates where rj bank has limited loss history are considered in combination to derive the final campi cre and cre construction loan grades and allowance percentages qualitative factors while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any significant quantitative adjustments to allowance percentagesfor residential first mortgage residential home equity and consumer loan classes the qualitative factors considered when assigning allowance percentages include loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores at origination occupancy ie owner occupied second home or investment property documentation level loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size and loan policy exceptions these qualitative factors while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any quantitative adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates historical loss rates a quantitative factor is utilized when assigning the allowance percentages for residential first mortgage residential home equity and consumer loans and are derived from estimates of the probability of default and loss given default severity these estimated loss rates are based on rj banks historical loss data from the eight quarters prior to the respective quarterend in addition to historical loss rates one other quantitative factor utilized for the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio is updated ltv ratios rj bank segregates the performing loans in the residential loan classes on a quarterly basis based upon updated ltv data rj bank obtains the most recently available information generally on a quarterlag to estimate the current ltv ratios on the individual loans in the residential mortgage loan portfolio current ltvs are estimated on a loan by loan basis utilizing the initial appraisal obtained at the time of origination adjusted for housing price changes that have occurred since origination using current valuation indices the value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to changes in the condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within current valuation indices and other factors the product of the default and loss severity percentages is then applied to the balance of residential first mortgages and residential home equity loan balances which have been further stratified by updated ltv in order to calculate the related allowance for loan lossesas tdrs regardless of the loan portfolio segment or accrual status are impaired loans rj bank evaluates its credit risk on an individual loan basis the amount of impairment recorded on these loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if collateral dependent based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell in addition all redefaults 60 or more days delinquent subsequent to the loans modification date on tdrs are factored into each portfolio segments allowance for loan losses qualitative information such as geographic area and industry for tdrs and redefaulted tdrs is considered and reviewed in the determination of expected loss rates as discussed aboverj bank reserves for potential losses inherent in its unfunded lending commitments using a methodology similar to that used for loans in the respective portfolio segment based upon loan grade and expected funding probabilities for fully binding commitments this will result in some reserve variability over different periods depending upon the mix of the loan portfolio at the time and future funding expectations all classes of impaired loans which have unfunded lending commitments are analyzed in conjunction with the impaired reserve process described above this reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reflected in other liabilities in our consolidated statements of financial condition115indexloan chargeoff policiescampi cre and cre construction loans are monitored on an individual basis and loan grades are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure they reflect the loans current credit risk when rj bank determines that it is likely a corporate loan will not be collected in full the loan is evaluated for potential impairment after consideration of the borrowers ability to restructure the loan alternative sources of repayment and other factors affecting the borrowers ability to repay the debt the portion of the loan deemed to be a confirmed loss if any is chargedoff for collateraldependent loans secured by real estate the amount of the loan considered a confirmed loss and chargedoff is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the collaterals appraised value less estimated costs to sell in instances where the individual loan under evaluation is agented by another bank and where the agent bank has not ordered a timely update of an outdated appraisal rj bank may make adjustments to previous appraised values for purposes of calculating specific reserves or taking partial chargeoffs these impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we evaluate on an ongoing basis all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation certain factors such as guarantor recourse additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals in its ongoing evaluation of each individual loan rj bank may consider more frequent appraisals in locations where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility for campi loans rj bank evaluates all sources of repayment including the estimated liquidation value of collateral to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and charged off corporate banking and credit risk managers also hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans loans that are rated special mention or worse as defined by bank regulators see note 9 for further discussion additional chargeoffs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flowsthe majority of rj banks corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in either sncs or other large syndicated loans in the us or canada the sncs are us loan syndications totaling over 20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions most snc loans are reviewed annually by the agent banks regulator a process in which the other participating banks have no involvement once the snc annual regulatory review process is complete rj bank receives a summary of the review of these snc credits from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ this summary includes a synopsis of each loans regulatory classification loans that are designated for nonaccrual status and directed chargeoffs rj bank must be at least as critical with nonaccrual designations directed chargeoffs and classifications as the occ this ensures that each bank participating in a snc loan rates the loan at least as critical any classification changes may impact rj banks reserves and chargeoffs during the quarter that the snc information is received from the occ however these differences in classifications are generally minimal given the size of the snc loan portfolio the amount of such adjustments depend upon the classification and whether rj bank had the loan classified differently either more or less critically than the snc review findings and therefore could result in higher lower or no change in loan loss provisions than previously recorded rj bank incorporates into its ratings process any observed regulatory trends in the annual snc exam process but there will inherently be differences of opinion on individual credits due to the high degree of judgment involved with respect to its ongoing credit evaluation process of the snc portfolio rj bank conforms to what it believes will be the regulators view of individual creditsevery residential mortgage and consumer loan over 60 days past due is reviewed by rj bank personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status appraised value and other data points rj bank senior management meets monthly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoffwritedown recommendations on every residential mortgage or consumer loan over 60 days past due with chargeoffs considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and then generally taken before the loan is 120 days past due a chargeoff is taken against the allowance for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that rj bank estimates will ultimately be collected based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell rj bank predominantly uses broker price opinions bpo for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the collection and foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed bpos contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace and therefore we have found these bpos to be reasonable determinants of market value in lieu of appraisals and more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values a full appraisal is obtained postforeclosure rj bank takes further chargeoffs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original bpo but does not reverse previously chargedoff amounts if the appraisal is higher than the original bpo if a loan remains in preforeclosure status for more than nine months an updated valuation is obtained and further chargeoffs are taken against the allowance for loan losses if necessary 116indexother assets rj bank

useful lives on a straightline method are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be fully recoverable the rights to service mortgage loans known as mortgage servicing rights msrs are an intangible asset our msrs arise when rj bank sells residential mortgage loans and retains the associated mortgage servicing rights rj bank records the estimated fair value of msrs and amortizes msrs in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing revenue msrs are assessed for impairment quarterly based on their fair value with any impairment recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income117indexgoodwill goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the related net assets acquired gaap does not provide for the amortization of indefinitelife intangible assets such as goodwill rather these assets are subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired however if the estimated fair value is below carrying value further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment this further analysis involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount in the course of our evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill we may perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary under this elective process we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative analysis is not required however if we conclude otherwise then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis if we either choose not to perform a qualitative assessment or we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred then we perform a quantitative evaluation in the case of a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit which the goodwill that is subject to the quantitative analysis is associated generally defined as the businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compare it to the carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the excess we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date see note 13 for additional information regarding the outcome of our goodwill impairment assessmentslegal liabilitieswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated whether a loss is probable and if so the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount within that range if the most likely amount of possible loss within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible we record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables the determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management management considers many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability balance is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management lastly each case is reviewed to determine if it is probable that insurance coverage will apply in which case the liability is reduced accordingly any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters we expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurred118indexsharebased compensationwe account for sharebased awards through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values the compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards and is calculated as the market value of the awards on the date of the grant see note 23 for additional information in addition we account for sharebased awards to our independent contractor financial advisors in accordance with guidance applicable to accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services and guidance applicable to accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock absent a specific performance commitment sharebased awards granted to our independent contractor financial advisors are measured at their vesting date fair value and their fair value estimated at reporting dates prior to that time the compensation expense recognized each period is based on the most recent estimated value further we classify these nonemployee awards as liabilities at fair value upon vesting with changes in fair value reported in earnings until these awards are exercised or forfeited for purposes of measuring compensation expense these awards are revalued at each reporting date see note 24 for additional information compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased compensation with future service requirements over the requisite service period using the straightline method and in certain instances the graded attribution methoddeferred compensation planswe maintain various deferred compensation plans for the benefit of certain employees and independent contractors that provide a return to the participant based upon the performance of various referenced investments for certain of these plans we invest directly as a principal in such investments related to our obligations to perform under the deferred compensation plans see the other investments discussion within the financial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased and fair value section of this note 2 for further discussion of these assets for other such plans including our long term incentive

provide a source of funds available to satisfy our obligations under the plan see note 10 for information regarding the carrying value of such policies compensation expense is recognized for all awards made under such plans with future service requirements over the requisite service period using the straightline method changes in the value of the investments as well as the expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in compensation commissions and benefits expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see notes 23 and 24 for additional informationleaseswe lease office space and equipment under operating leases we recognize rent expense related to these operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term the lease term commences on the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date on which we take possession of the property for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays we record a deferred rent liability in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition and amortize the deferred rent over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in instances where the office space or equipment under an operating lease will be abandoned prior to the expiration of the lease term these instances primarily result from the effects of acquisitions we accrue an estimate of any projected loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income at the time such abandonment is known and any loss is estimableacquisition related expenseacquisition related expenses are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income and include certain incremental expenses associated with our acquisition transactions predominately associated with our morgan keegan acquisition as well as incremental costs to integrate our operations and those

payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or liquidity see note 19 for further information on our income

consolidate the vies that are subject to assessment when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie the process for determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie is to conclude whether we are a party to the vie holding a variable interest that meets both of the following criteria 1 has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and 2 has the obligations to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the viefiscal year 2011 impact of the adoption of new accounting consolidation guidance in fiscal year 2011 we adopted new accounting guidance regarding the consolidation of vies this new guidance enacted changes in determining the primary beneficiary of a vie and increased the frequency of required reassessments to determine whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie prior to this new accounting guidance our determination of whether we were the primary beneficiary of a vie was based upon whether we were the party to the vie that absorbed a majority of the vies expected losses received a majority of its expected residual returns or both as a result of the application of the new accounting guidance during the year ended september 30 2011 we1 deconsolidated two lihtc funds in which rjtcf had been deemed to be the primary beneficiary under the prior accounting guidance these two entities had consolidated assets of approximately 35 million and no consolidated liabilities within equity their deconsolidation resulted in an aftertax cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings and noncontrolling interests of 33 million and 68 million respectively 2 consolidated two lihtc funds in which rjtcf is deemed to be the primary beneficiary under the new accounting guidance these two entities had consolidated assets of 568 million and consolidated liabilities of 421 million and since we hold less than a 1 interest in these entities the equity impact of their consolidation was a 147 million increase in noncontrolling interests120indexeif funds the eif funds are limited partnerships for which we are the general partner the eif funds invest in certain of our private equity activities as well as other unaffiliated venture capital limited partnerships the eif funds were established as

trust in connection with certain of our restricted stock unit awards this trust fund was established and funded for the purpose of acquiring our common stock in the open market to be used to settle restricted stock units granted as a retention vehicle for certain employees of our canadian subsidiary we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and accordingly consolidate this trust fundlihtc fundsrjtcf is the managing member or general partner in a number of lihtc funds having one or more investor members or limited partners these lowincome housing tax credit funds are organized as llcs or limited partnerships for the purpose of investing in a number of project partnerships which are limited partnerships or llcs that in turn purchase and develop lowincome housing properties qualifying for tax credits our determination of the primary beneficiary of each tax credit fund in which rjtcf has a variable interest requires judgment and is based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances including 1 an assessment of the characteristics of rjtcfs variable interest and other involvements it has with the tax credit fund including involvement of related parties and any de facto agents as well as the involvement of other variable interest holders namely limited partners or investor members and 2 the tax credit funds purpose and design including the risks that the tax credit fund was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders in the design of tax credit fund vies the overriding premise is that the investor members invest solely for tax attributes associated with the portfolio of lowincome housing properties held by the fund while rjtcf as the managing member or general partner of the fund is responsible for overseeing the funds operations nonguaranteed lowincome housing tax credit fundsas the managing member or general partner of the fund except for one guaranteed fund discussed below rjtcf does not provide guarantees related to the delivery or funding of tax credits or other tax attributes to the investor members or limited partners of tax credit funds the investor members or limited partners of the vies bear the risk of loss on their investment additionally under the tax credit funds designed structure the investor members or limited partners receive nearly all of the tax credits and taxdeductible loss benefits designed to be delivered by the fund entity as well as a majority of any proceeds upon a sale of a project partnership held by a tax credit fund fund level residuals rjtcf earns fees from the fund for its services in organizing the fund identifying and acquiring the project partnership investments ongoing asset management fees and a share of any residuals arising from sale of project partnerships upon the termination of the fundthe determination of whether rjtcf is the primary beneficiary of any of the nonguaranteed lihtc funds in which it holds a variable interest is primarily dependent upon 1 the analysis of whether the other variable interest holders in the tax credit fund hold significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the tax credit funds economic performance andor 2 whether rjtcf has an obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the tax credit fund vie which could potentially be significant to the fundrjtcf sponsors two general types of nonguaranteed tax credit funds either nonguaranteed single investor funds or nonguaranteed multiinvestor funds in single investor funds rjtcf has concluded that the one single investor member or limited partner in such funds has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund and therefore rjtcf as managing member or general partner of such funds does not have the power over such activities accordingly rjtcf is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such single investor funds and these funds are not consolidated in multiinvestor funds rjtcf has concluded that since the participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund are not held by one single investor rjtcf is deemed to have the power over such activities rjtcf then assesses whether its projected benefits to be received from the multiinvestor funds primarily from ongoing asset management fees or its share of any residuals upon the termination of the fund are potentially significant to the fund rjtcf is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates any multiinvestor fund for which it concludes that such benefits are potentially significant to the fund 121indexamong the lihtc fund entities evaluated rjtcf determined that some of the lihtc funds it sponsors are not vies these funds are either 1 funds which rjtcf holds a significant interest one of which typically holds interests in certain tax credit limited partnerships for less than 90 days

the collateral associated with impaired syndicated loans given that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these partnerships or

the funds investor member receives tax credits eligible to apply against their federal tax liability these new market tax credits are taken by the investor member over a seven year period each of these nmtc funds have one investor member we have concluded that in each of the nmtc funds the investor member of such funds has significant participating rights over the activities that most

value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in significant unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those unobservable inputs are described belowauction rate securitiesone of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of auction rate securities presented within our available for sale securities portfolio relates to judgments regarding whether the level of observable trading activity is sufficient to conclude markets are active where insufficient levels of trading activity are determined to exist as of the reporting date then managements assessment of how much weight to apply to trading prices in inactive markets versus managements own valuation models could significantly impact the valuation conclusion the valuation of the securities impacted by changes in managements assessment of market activity levels could be either higher or lower depending upon the relationship of the inactive trading prices compared to the outcome of managements internal valuation modelsthe future interest rate and maturity assumptions impacting the valuation of the auction rate securities are directly related as shortterm interest rates rise due to the variable nature of the penalty interest rate provisions embedded in most of these securities in the event auctions fail to set the securitys interest rate then a penalty rate that is specified in the security increases these penalty rates are based upon a stated interest rate spread over what is typically a shortterm base interest rate index management estimates that at some level of increase in shortterm interest rates issuers of the securities will have the economic incentive to refinance and thus prepay the securities therefore the shortterm interest rate assumption directly impacts the input related to the timing of any projected prepayment the faster and steeper shortterm interest rates rise the earlier prepayments will likely occur and the higher the fair value of the securityprivate equity investmentsthe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of private equity investments relate to the financial performance of the investment entity and the markets required return on investments from entities in industries in which we hold investments significant increases or decreases in our investment entities future economic performance will have a directly proportional impact on the valuation results the value of our investment moves inversely with the markets expectation of returns from such investments should the market require higher returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will decrease in value should the market accept lower returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will increase in value135indexfair value optionthe fair value option is an accounting election that allows the reporting entity to apply fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis as of september 30

and cash equivalents assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value of these instruments these financial instruments generally expose us to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market ratesbank loans net  these financial instruments are primarily comprised of loans originated or purchased by rj bank and include campi loans commercial and residential real estate loans as well as consumer loans intended to be held until maturity or payoff in addition these financial instruments consist of loans held for sale which are carried at the lower of cost or market value a portion of these loans held for sale are included in the nonrecurring fair value measurements in addition to any impaired loans held for investmentfair values for both variable and fixedrate loans held for investment are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality this methodology for estimating the fair value of loans does not consider other market variables and therefore is not based on an exit price concept refer to note 2

methodology similar to that described above for loans and further adjusted for the probability of funding the fair value of these unfunded lending commitments in addition to the fair value of other offbalance sheet financial instruments are not material and therefore are excluded from the table that follows see note 26 for further discussion of offbalance sheet financial instruments136indexfor those financial instruments where the fair value is not reflected on the consolidated statements of financial condition we have estimated their fair value in part based upon our assumptions the estimated amount and timing of future cash flows and estimated discount rates different assumptions could significantly affect these estimated fair values accordingly the net realizable values could be materially different from the estimates presented in the table below in addition the estimates are only indicative of the value of individual financial instruments and should not be considered an

whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are considered to be other than temporarily impaired as we have the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity to assess

addition to historical details home prices and the economic outlook are considered to derive the assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model to project security specific cash flows which factors in the amount of credit enhancement specific to the security the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected and the amortized cost basis is the credit loss and is recorded

that position for 12 months or more and two were in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than 12 months based on the expected cash flows derived from the model utilized in our analysis we expect to recover all unrealized losses not already recorded in earnings on our nonagency cmos however it is possible that the underlying loan collateral of these securities will perform worse than current expectations which may lead to adverse changes in the cash flows expected to be collected on these securities and potential future otti losses as residential mortgage loans are the underlying collateral of these securities the unrealized losses at september 30 2013 reflect the uncertainty in the markets ars our cost basis in the ars we hold is the fair value of the securities in the period in which we acquired them only those ars whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are considered to be otherthantemporarily impaired as we have the ability and intent to hold

refunding warrants ars jeff co sewers ars in the prior fiscal year jefferson county alabama filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 9 of the us bankruptcy code in the us district court for the northern district of alabama this proceeding is ongoing as of september 30 2013 there is no impairment of the jeff co schools ars or the jeff co sewers ars since the fair value of such securities exceed their cost   during the year ended september 30 2012 unrealized losses arose for both the jeff co schools ars and the jeff co sewers ars based upon a decrease in the fair values of these securities based upon the available information as of september 30 2012 we prepared cash flow forecasts for the purpose of determining the amount of any otti related to credit losses refer to the table in the following section for the amount of otti related to credit losses which we determined regarding these ars holdings as of september 30 2013 there is no potential impairment within the ars preferred securities since the fair values of such securities exceed their cost as of september 30 2012 the fair value of certain ars preferred securities were less than their cost indicating a potential impairment accordingly we analyzed the credit ratings associated with each security as an indicator of potential credit impairment and including subsequent ratings changes we determined that all of the ars preferred securities were rated investment grade by at least one rating agency at such time given that these ars are by their design variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates decreases in projected future shortterm interest rates have a negative impact on projected cash flows and potentially a negative impact on the fair value the unrealized losses at september 30 2012 were primarily due to a decrease in projected future shortterm interest rates at such time which resulted in a lower fair value we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the ars preferred securities we hold at september 30 2012 we concluded that none of the otti within our portfolio of ars preferred securities related to credit lossesotherthantemporarily impaired securitiesalthough there is no intent to sell either our ars or our nonagency cmos and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities we do not expect to recover the

value less costs to acquire and sell of any underlying collateral in a timely mannerspecial mention  loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention these loans are not

period indicated our assumption regarding whether we would make such election changed for one of the morgan keegan entities we acquired the offsetting balance associated with this adjustment to goodwill was the net deferred tax asset3the impairment expense in the year ended september 30 2013 is associated with the rjes reporting unit we concluded the goodwill associated with this reporting unit to be completely impaired during the quarter ended march 31 2013 since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the goodwill impairment testing date for the year ended september 30 2013 the effect of this impairment expense on the pretax income attributable to raymond james financial inc is approximately 46 million and the portion of the impairment expense attributable to the noncontrolling interests is approximately 23 million goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2012 we elected to not exercise the option to perform a qualitative assessment but instead to perform a quantitative assessment of the equity value of each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill in our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit under the market approach we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges and the book value of comparable transactions the estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows in estimating future cash flows a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit or for the nine month period since the closing date for morgan keegan reporting units were compiled future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections the cash flows were discounted at the reporting units estimated cost of equity which was derived through application of the capital asset pricing model the valuation result from the market approach was dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings finally significant management judgment was applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach which resulted in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit156indexthe following summarizes certain key assumptions utilized in our quantitative analysis as of december 31 2012      key assumptions          weight

decline in overall market conditions adverse business trends and changes in regulations based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments as of december 31 2012 we concluded that the goodwill associated with rjes a joint venture based in paris france that we hold a controlling interest in was completely impaired the impairment expense recorded in the year ended september 30 2013 of 69 million is included in other expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the annual testing date our share of this impairment expense after consideration of the noncontrolling interests amounts to 46 million rjes is an entity that provides research coverage on european corporations as well as having sales and trading operations the decline in value of rjes is primarily due to the continuing economic slowdown experienced in europe which has had a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended march 31 2013 which impact rjes operating plans on a going forward basis in april 2013 we purchased all of the outstanding equity in rjes that was held by others thus we now have sole control over rjesthere was no goodwill impairment in any other reporting unit in midfebruary 2013 the client accounts and financial advisors of mk amp co were transferred to rjampa pursuant to our morgan keegan acquisition integration strategies as a result certain rjampa and mk amp co reporting units which have an allocation of both private client group as well as capital markets goodwill were combined we assessed whether these transfers which occurred after our annual goodwill impairment testing date could change our conclusions regarding no impairment of goodwill in the reporting units effected by the transfers based upon our qualitative analysis related to those reporting units we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the combined reporting units equity exceeds the combined reporting units carrying value including goodwill after the effect of such transfers the change in our reportable segments which was effective as of september 30 2013 see notes 1 and 28 for additional information did not cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as the reporting units which were impacted by this change do not have an allocation of goodwillno other events have occurred since december 31 2012 that would cause us to update the annual impairment testing we performed as of that date157indexidentifiable intangible assets netthe following summarizes our identifiable intangible asset balances by segment net of accumulated amortization and activity for

purchase and sell securities as either principal or agent on behalf of our clients if either the client or counterparty fails to perform we may be required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party in such circumstances we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is different from the contract value of the transactionwe also act as an intermediary between brokerdealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one brokerdealer and then lend them to another securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions we measure the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis the market value of securities borrowed was 646 million and securities loaned was 427 million at september 30 2013 and the market value of securities borrowed was 931 million and securities loaned was 818 million at september 30 2012 the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 664 million and 495 million respectively at september 30 2013 and the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 963 million and 915 million respectively at september 30 2012 additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized if another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed for example failure to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transaction184indexwe have also loaned to brokerdealers and other financial institutions securities owned by clients and others for

loaned was 3051 million and 3396 million at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively if a borrowing institution or brokerdealer does not return a security we may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return it to the owner in such circumstances we may incur a loss equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial institution or the brokerdealerwe have sold securities that we do not currently own and will therefore be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date we have recorded 2207 million and 2324 million at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively which represents the market value of such securities see notes 5 and 6 for further information we are subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal yearend we utilize short positions on government obligations and equity securities to economically hedge long proprietary inventory positionswe enter into security transactions on behalf of our clients and other brokers involving forward settlement forward contracts provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument the contractual amounts related to these financial instruments reflect the volume and activity and do not reflect the amounts at risk the gain or loss on these transactions is recognized on a trade date basis transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument our exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors including the duration size composition and diversification of positions held the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and market volatility the credit risk for these transactions is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains recorded in the consolidated statements of financial conditionthe majority of our transactions and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure is with clients brokerdealers and other financial institutions in the us these activities primarily involve collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations we seek to control our credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties financial condition and credit ratings we monitor collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and request changes in collateral levels as appropriaterj ltd is subject to foreign exchange risk primarily due to financial instruments held in us dollars that may be impacted by fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in order to mitigate this risk rj ltd enters into forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of these contracts is not significant as of september 30 2013 forward contracts outstanding to buy and sell us dollars totaled cdn 5 million and cdn 58 million respectively rj bank is also subject to foreign exchange risk related to its net investment in a canadian subsidiary see note 18 for information regarding how rj bank utilizes net investment hedges to mitigate a significant portion of this riskrj bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases which then extend over varying periods of time these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments and each customers credit worthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis fixedrate commitments if any are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and rj banks exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments a summary of commitments

financial standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary these standby letters of credit generally expire in one year or less as of september 30 2013 123 million of such letters of credit were outstanding in the event that a letter of credit is drawn down rj bank would pursue repayment from the party under the existing borrowing relationship or would liquidate collateral or both the proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to clients and accordingly rj bank uses a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitmentsopen end consumer lines of credit represent the unfunded amounts of loans primarily secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of creditbecause many lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or part the contract amounts are not estimates of rj banks actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements rj bank maintains a reserve to provide for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments see note 9 for further discussion of this reserve for unfunded lending commitmentscredit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that the collateral or other security is of no value rj bank uses the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments and other creditrelated offbalance sheet instruments as it does in making loansas a part of our fixed income public finance operations rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase gnma mbs see note 20 for information on these commitments we utilize tba security contracts to hedge our interest rate risk associated with these commitments we incur either
