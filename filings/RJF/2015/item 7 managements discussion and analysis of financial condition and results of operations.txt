the following managements discussion and analysis mdampa is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition mdampa is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2015 compared with the year ended september 30 2014 for the sixth consecutive year we achieved record net revenues for the fiscal year 52 billion in fiscal year 2015 a 339 million or 7 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues total client assets under administration increased to 480 billion at september 30 2015 a 1 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting results and high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors which more than offset the decline in the us equity markets for the year primarily occurring in our fourth fiscal quarterwe also achieved a record level of net income of 502 million an increase of 22 million or 5 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 343 increased 011 or 3 over the prior year amount noninterest expenses increased 278 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increased revenues in addition as a result of various growth strategies across our businesses we experienced an increase in our business development expenses our strategic efforts during the year to continually improve the technology available to our financial advisors as well as the additional costs of compliance with various new rules and regulations impacting our industry are factors impacting an increase in our communications and information processing expenses the provision for loan losses increased significantly year over year as the prior year benefited to a greater extent than the current year from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the combination of the above noted factors even after consideration of the incremental expenses resulting from activities associated with the strategic growth initiatives that should favorably impact future revenues resulted in a pretax margin on net revenues of 153 a level that is nearly equivalent to the 154 pretax margin on net revenues in the prior yeara summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 35 billion a 228 million or 7 increase over the prior year pretax income also established a record at 342 million a 12 million or 4 increase over the prior year the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues client assets under administration of the private client group increased 1 over the prior year level to 4533 billion at september 30 2015 the increase in commission revenues and client assets have resulted primarily from successful recruiting of financial advisors and high levels of financial advisor retention we had our second best financial advisor recruiting year ever in fiscal year 2015 with a net increase of 331 financial advisors over the year to 6596 affiliated financial advisors as of september 30 2015 there was an overall net increase in client assets despite the impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased 5 as we incurred increases in certain costs associated with the successful recruiting efforts and continued information system improvements on july 31 2015 we completed our 35indexacquisition of the producers choice llc tpc a private insurance and annuity marketing organization based in troy michigan our acquisition of tpc brings more life insurance and annuity experts to the firm to support financial advisors and their clientsthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 960 million a 7 million or 1 increase over the prior year pretax income was 107 million a decrease of 24 million or 18 compared to the prior year fiscal year 2015 reflected new record levels of merger and acquisition fees and tax credit fund syndication fees commission revenues from fixed income institutional sales increased over the prior year level resulting in part from growth in our public finance activities however equity underwriting revenues declined compared to the prior year as a result of weakness in both the energy and real estate sectors which also led to a decline in commission revenues on equity products the net profit generated by this segment was negatively impacted by increased costs some of which result from our efforts during the year to broadly build out certain sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in certain sectors which we believe present solid longterm opportunities for future revenue growth the continued difficult market environment in canada negatively impacted this segments revenues and profitabilityour asset management segment generated record net revenues of 392 million a 23 million or 6 increase over the prior year pretax income was a record 135 million a 7 million or 5 increase over the prior year financial assets under management increased 1 from the prior year to 652 billion as of september 30 2015 the increase resulted from net inflows of client assets which more than offset the unfavorable impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions on april 30 2015 we completed our acquisition of cougar global investments limited cougar an asset management firm based in toronto canada that markets its investment services to high net worth individuals families foundations trusts and institutions in canada and the united statesrj bank generated record net revenues of 414 million a 63 million or 18 increase over the prior year pretax income was a record 279 million a 36 million or 15 increase over the prior year net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding coupled with a modest increase in net interest margin our provision for loan losses increased 10 million or 74 compared to the prior year we incurred substantial provision for loan losses associated with loan growth in both years however the majority of the yearoveryear increase resulted from the prior year benefiting to a greater extent than the current year from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the credit characteristics of the loan portfolio generally improved over the year reflecting the positive impact of improved economic conditions activities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that was 19 million less than the prior year net revenues in this segment increased 25 million resulting from increases in revenues associated with our private equity portfolio investments and an increase in gains resulting from our auction rate securities portfolio sales and redemption activities as a result of the increase in private equity investment revenues the portion of this segments pretax income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests also increasedour fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate was 371 up from the 358 in the prior year as a result of the fiscal year 2015 decline in equity market values compared to positive markets in fiscal year 2014 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses arising from the value of our companyowned life insurance portfolio had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by 12 compared to the prior year effective tax rateconsistent with our growth strategies we completed two acquisitions during the year cougar and tpc we continue to evaluate future opportunities but remain committed to our strategy that our acquisitions must meet our strategic growth objectives involve entities that share our culture of conservatism and clientfirst values and be executed at purchase prices that provide us opportunities to increase our shareholders valueduring the year we implemented the new basel iii regulatory capital rules a change which did not have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios we have published the results of the 2015 doddfrank act mandated stress test the results of which indicated that both rjf and rj bank have sufficient capital to successfully navigate a severe and prolonged economic downturn while still maintaining capital levels that exceed both regulatory requirements and higher management thresholds throughout the course of the severely adverse scenario the volume of possible regulatory changes that impact the businesses in which we operate continues to grow and evolve regulatory rulemaking activities that have arisen during the year include the dol proposed rule enhancing standards for individuals providing investment advice to retirement plans their participants or beneficiaries we are continuing our study and evaluation of the proposal the total impact of the standard once finalized and implemented on our business is unknown at this 36indextime we continue to monitor the impact of proposed future legislation while implementing new regulations we presently do not expect currently enacted legislation to have a significant adverse direct impact on our operations as a whole however we continue to evaluate the specific impacts of eachyear ended september 30 2014 compared with the year ended september 30 2013we achieved record net revenues of 49 billion in fiscal year 2014 a 376 million or 8 increase compared to the prior year the increase generated by our ongoing operations is even greater than that amount after factoring in the 74 million of revenue reflected in fiscal year 2013 that was associated with a private equity investment we sold in that year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues total client assets under administration increased to 475 billion at september 30 2014 a 12 increase over the prior year level we also achieved a record level of net income in fiscal year 2014 to 480 million an increase of 113 million or 31 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 332 in fiscal year 2014 increased 074 or 29 over the fiscal year 2013 amount after excluding the acquisition related and other nonrecurring expenses we incurred in fiscal year 2013 our adjusted net income in fiscal year 2014 increased 61 million or 15 compared to fiscal year 2013 a nongaap measure1 the increase in net income in fiscal year 2014 over the prior year level is even more significant given that the fiscal year 2013 net income included 14 million after the attribution to noncontrolling interests arising from our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion a private equity holding which was sold during fiscal year 2013noninterest expenses increased 254 million in fiscal year 2014 or 7 compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal year 2014 is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses which were partially offset by the decrease in acquisition related expenses acquisition and integration related expenses in fiscal year 2014 were no longer material for separate reporting since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the combination of increasing net revenues and overall expense control in fiscal year 2014 helped us achieve a 154 pretax margin on net revenuesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal year 2014 as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 33 billion in fiscal year 2014 a 12 increase while pretax income increased 100 million or 43 to a record 330 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in corresponding commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased by 3 client assets under administration of the private client group increased 12 over the prior year level to 4506 billion at september 30 2014 net inflows of client assets in fiscal year 2014 were positively impacted by successful recruiting of financial advisors among other favorable factorsthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 953 million in fiscal year 2014 a 3 increase while pretax income increased 28 million or 28 to a record 131 million increases in trading profits merger and acquisition fee revenues equity underwriting fee revenues and institutional sales commissions on equity products more than offset a decline in institutional sales commissions on fixed income products the decline in institutional fixed income commission revenues results from challenging fixed income market conditions during fiscal year 2014 due to economic uncertainty historically low interest rates relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and decreased customer trading volumes our asset management segment generated record net revenues of 370 million in fiscal year 2014 a 26 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 33 to a record 128 million financial assets under management increased 15 from the prior year to 646 billion as of september 30 2014 both strong net inflows of client assets and market appreciation contributed to the increase we also earned nearly 10 million in performance fees in fiscal year 2014 compared to nearly 2 million in the prior year as a result of positive net performance from certain of our managed funds a portion of which are attributable to noncontrolling interests which contributed to the increase in revenues and pretax income 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa37indexrj bank generated record net revenues of 352 million in fiscal year 2014 a 1 increase while pretax income decreased 25 million or 9 to 243 million net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding offset in large part by a lower net interest margin the provision for loan losses increased in fiscal year 2014 primarily as the result of significant loan portfolio growth partially offset by decreases resulting from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio reflecting the positive impact from improved economic conditions noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses increased 19 millionactivities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that is 48 million less in fiscal year 2014 than the prior year our noninterest expenses decreased substantially as we are no longer incurring acquisition and integration related costs since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 in addition fiscal year 2013 included significant revenues and pretax income associated with our indirect investment in albion which was sold in april 2013 thus having a significant impact on comparisons to the prior year our fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate was 358 up from the 349 in fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements

may not be indicative of our core operating results and that the gaap and the nongaap measures should be considered together there are no nongaap adjustments in either of the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 or 2014 as we do not separately report acquisition and integration related costs in those years given that our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september

analysiswe have certain assets and liabilities primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments which are subject to changes in interest rates and would have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance in the event of a change in shortterm interest rates a gradual increase in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this report which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankbased upon our analysis performed as of september 30 2015 we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates would result in an increase in our pretax income of approximately 150 million over the subsequent twelve month period approximately 55 of such an increase would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest income from client cash balances in our multibank sweep program and the discontinuance of money market fund fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2015 and a conservative assumption related to interest credited to our clients on their cash balances in such an interest rate environment the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments all of which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the great majority of the benefit to pretax income from an increase in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume any further increases in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients through our various cash sweep programs and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense 40indexthe following table presents our consolidated average interestearning asset and liability balances interest income and expense balances and the average

administration increased to 4533 billion an increase of 27 billion or 1 compared to september 30 2014 the year over year increase in client assets was driven by positive net inflows generated by financial advisor retention and recruiting results as the equity markets in the us were down compared to the prior year the most significant increase in these revenues arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 212 million or 17 and was partially offset by a 27 million or 9 decrease in commissions on equity products a 13 million or 15 decrease in new issue sales credits due to a decrease in equity underwritings and a 4 million or 5 decrease in commissions on fixed income products fiscal year 2015 includes a 7 million decrease in mutual fund commission revenues due to the resolution of a mutual fund share class issue that resulted in refunds of commissions being paid during the year to certain of our clients despite this unusual item mutual fund commission revenues still increased 2 million commission revenues on equity products have decreased in our canadian brokerdealer subsidiary as a result of the weaker canadian currency compared to the us dollar as well as the overall challenging canadian market conditions that existed throughout the fiscal year commission earnings on fixed income products decreased primarily due to the continuation of historically low interest rates which continue to result in challenging fixed income market conditions total account and service fee revenues increased 52 million or 13 mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 37 million or 17 primarily as a result of an increase in education and marketing support ems fees which include notransactionfee ntf program revenues and mutual fund omnibus fees all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios increases in such revenues are a result of increases in the number of positions for existing fund families on the omnibus platform as well as new fund families joining the omnibus program client account and service fees increased 14 million or 9 as a result of the changes made in many of our fee schedules implemented since december 2013 in addition transaction handling fees in feebased accounts increased due to the increased number of transactions fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks increased due to higher average balances in the program and sbl affiliate servicing fees increased refer to the rj bank results of operations in this report for additional information on sbl activities as sbl balances have continued to growpcg net interest is relatively unchanged compared to the prior year net interest income arising from our brokerdealer margin lending activities decreased slightly compared to the prior year level a slight decline in margin interest rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average margin loan balances outstanding the rate of growth in margin loan balances in fiscal year 2015 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our sbl product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest rate environment that existed during fiscal year 2015 and the related low net interest spreads earned

in the us which were generally improved as compared to fiscal year 2013 and increased financial advisor productivity the most significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2014 arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 245 million or 24 and commission revenues on mutual fund products which increased 57 million or 9 primarily due to increases in trailing commissions on mutual fund products partially offset by a 21 million or 21 decrease in commissions on fixed income products commission earnings on fixed income products in fiscal year 2014 decreased

products we distribute in fiscal year 2014 we continued to implement changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under

significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arising from our us operations led by our technology services sector and reflecting the benefit of prior years investments in other business sectors the portion of these revenues arising from our canadian operations decreased significantly due to the difficult canadian equity market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 especially in the natural resources sector our net trading profits decreased 5 million or 8 typically our trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities however in fiscal year 2015 the primary reason for the decrease is 5 million of realized trading losses arising in our canadian operations primarily attributable to a loss on an equity underwriting position despite the continuation of the

a 3 million or 16 increase in communications and information support processing expense and a 7 million or 14 increase in other expenses the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense is primarily attributable to increased fees paid to external managers for raymond james consulting services and uma programs which have both experienced increases in asset levels compared to the prior year the increase in communications and information processing expense result from additional costs associated with supporting the steadily increasing levels of assets under management as well as the growth in asset levels in our nondiscretionary assetbased programs the increase in other expense is primarily due to eagles share of certain costs incurred in the organization and startup of a new fund in which eagle serves as the subadvisor  noncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries including clarivest total segment net

and raymond james consulting services program asset under management balances the increase in other expense in fiscal year 2014 is primarily due to increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other brokerdealers and increases in expenses of rj trust resulting from the increase in client assets the increase in administrative and performance based incentive compensation in fiscal year 2014 is a result of the combination of increases in performance compensation which is directly related to the increase in

23net revenues in this segment increased 25 million or 71 the increase results from a 25 million increase in revenues arising from our principal capital and private equity portfolio investments we also realized an increase in revenues arising from the sale or redemption activities in our ars portfolio of 4 million which were offset by certain foreign currency translation losses that primarily result from the weakened canadian dollar and decreases in the valuation of other investments primarily in managed equities the current year ars portfolio gain is primarily the result of an 11 million gain on the sale of all of our jefferson county alabama limited obligation school warrants ars in the prior year gains resulting from sales and redemption activities in our ars portfolio were primarily comprised of a 55 million gain on the redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 8

fiscal year 2014 decreased 81 million or 177 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in fiscal year 2014 arising from our private equity portfolio investments approximately 74 million of fiscal year 2013 revenues were associated with our indirect investment in albion an investment which was sold in april 2013 and therefore such revenues did not recur in fiscal year 2014

61indexnoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2014 decreased 74 million or 63 the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in acquisition related expenses since our integration of morgan keegan was

operations into our own see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on the components of the fiscal year 2013 expense the portion of

and capital requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosuresfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assets70indexin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentslevel 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2015 79 of our total assets and 32 of our total liabilities are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of september 30 2014 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 86 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilitiesfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 356 million as of september 30 2015 and represent 17 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2015 our private equity investments comprise 209 million or 59 of the total and our ars positions comprise 139 million or 39 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 62 million or 15 as compared to the september 30 2014 level primarily as a result of sales and redemptions of ars which generated proceeds of 64 million and a gain of 11 million in the year ended september 30 2015 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information level 3 assets represent 74 of total equity as of september 30 2015 reflecting a decrease from the 94 of total equity measure as of september 30 2014financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount to 58 thousand as of september 30 2015 and represent less than 1 of liabilities measured at fair value which is unchanged from such measure at september 30 2014valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial 71indexinstrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2015 and 2014 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2015 are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2015 7 of our gross trading security assets and 62 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2015 93 of our gross trading security assets and 38 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2015 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset 72indexor an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bank the rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelsavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 73 of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 27 is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchydebt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive loss income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most nonagency securities at september 30 2015 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of 73indexthe ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity investments and comprise 59 of all of our level 3 assets as of september 30 2015 the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with third parties andor discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the partnership as provided by the fund manager investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchygoodwill impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment evaluating the balances as of december 31 2014 for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of december 31 2014 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill 74indexallocated to any of our reporting units as of december 31 2014 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2014 that would cause us to update our latest

132 billion and an allowance for loan losses of 1723 million was recorded against that balance the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 132 of the amortized cost of the loan portfoliothe uncertainty of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bankincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or liquidity 75indexwe have provided for us deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that the cumulative undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested no deferred us federal income taxes have been provided because the time or manner of repatriation is uncertain we cannot determine the impact of local taxes withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability that would be payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated at the present time we have no plans or intentions to repatriate funds for which no us income tax has been provided see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further informationeffects of recently issued
