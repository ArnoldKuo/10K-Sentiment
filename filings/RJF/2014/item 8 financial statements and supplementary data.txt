brokerdealer subsidiariesto the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions a change in applicable statutes regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our businessthe financial services industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws new rules and regulations resulting from the doddfrank act in july 2010 the u s government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform amp consumer protection act doddfrank act the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately however the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies furthermore many provisions of the doddfrank act are still subject to further rule making procedures and studies and will take effect over several years the doddfrank act instructs us federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings studies and reports these regulatory agencies include the commodity futures trading commission the sec the fed the occ the fdic the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council the fsoc as 10indexa result of doddfrank act rulemaking and other regulatory reforms we are currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct certain aspects of our business given the current status of the regulatory developments we cannot currently quantify the possible effects on our business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway see item 1a risk factors within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations certain of the changes enacted under the doddfrank act thus far include the followingsince rj bank provides deposits covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is subject to the federal deposit insurance act in february 2011 under the provisions of the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments for banks with more than 10 billion in assets the fdics new rule changed the assessment rate calculation which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the fdics exposure should the bank fail this new rule became effective for rj bank beginning with the december 2013 assessment period in july 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act the cfpb began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has supervisory and enforcement powers under such laws as the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act real estate settlement procedures act fair credit reporting act fair debt collection act the consumer financial privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and certain other statutes at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 the cfpb assumed regulatory authority over rj bank for its compliance with various federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment the majority of those became effective in early fiscal year 2014 the cfpb has authority to promulgate regulations and issue orders policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions the creation of the cfpb has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination remediation efforts and possible penaltiesin october 2012 under the provisions of the doddfrank act regulators issued final rules requiring banking organizations with total assets of more than 10 billion but less than 50 billion to conduct annual companyprepared stress tests report the results to their primary regulator and the fed and publish a summary of the results under the rules stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios baseline adverse and severely adverse which the fed

review the details contained in the final volcker rule to assess its impact on our operations based upon our latest analysis and understandings of these regulations we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our results of operations  the final volcker rule prohibits regulated entities from engaging in proprietary trading and imposes limitations on the extent to which regulated entities are permitted to invest in certain covered funds ie hedge funds and private equity funds and requires that such investments be fully deducted from tier 1 capital it limits a regulated entitys aggregate ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds to three percent of tier i capital although the impact of such limit to rjfs investment portfolio is subject to further analysis additionally regulated entities are prohibited from owning three percent or more of any single fund congress provided an exemption for certain permitted activities of regulated entities such as underwriting market making hedging and risk managementthe final volcker rules became effective as of april 1 2014 and conformance is required by july 21 2015 however the conformance period may be subject to two additional oneyear extensions by the fed furthermore regulated entities can apply for an additional fiveyear extension for certain qualifying investments we currently maintain investments in selected private equity and merchant banking entities some of which may meet the definition of covered funds and therefore be subject to certain limitations the amount of future investments of this nature that we may make may be 11indexlimited in order to maintain compliance levels specified by the regulation further subsequent interpretations of what constitutes covered

and makes selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the rule becomes effective for us on january 1 2015 subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both rjf and rj bank however based on our current analyses we believe that rjf and rj bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules however the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this report for more informationin july 2014 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds the amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdraws over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds while preserving the benefits of the funds we do not sponsor any money market funds we utilize such funds to a small extent for our own investment purposes and offer to our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternativeseffective july 1 2014 certain final rules issued by the sec regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors became effective these rules specify which activities will be covered by the doddfrank act imposed fiduciary duty of a municipal advisor to its government client may result in the need for new written representations by issuers and may limit the manner in which we in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles interact with municipal issuers we registered as a municipal advisor and by virtue of such registration are now subject to additional regulation and oversight in respect of our municipal finance business the sec recently announced that it will undertake a twoyear review of municipal advisors additionally forthcoming rulemaking by the municipal securities rulemaking board may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local government are able to interact with the outside finance professionals although these new rules impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients and may have a negative shortterm impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry adapts to the new rules we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations which are included in our capital markets segment other regulations

october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries however based on our current analyses we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our brokerdealer subsidiaries pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to brokerdealers financial

liquidity and the trading price of our common stock or our senior notes which are listed on the nyserisks related to our business and industrydamage to our reputation could damage our businessesmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients customers investors and associates if we fail to deal with or appear to fail to deal with issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy record keeping sales and trading practices failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in our products a failure to maintain appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to our reputation further negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may also harm our future business prospects we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including levels of economic output interest and inflation rates employment levels consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy these conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits 15indexat times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low levels of economic output artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high rates of unemployment and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad these conditions led to several factors in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while select factors indicate signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting financial advisory and other services increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses these periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited  us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the middle east and in eastern europe and russia concerns about the european unions eu sovereign debt in recent years has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the eus financial support programs and the possibility exists that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these matters could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity  our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states foreign governments and domestic and international agencies the fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict we may also be indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy enacted in various global marketsus state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america united states andor canadian factors which are indicative of market conditions include interest rates the rate of unemployment real estate prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earningslack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionmaintaining an appropriate level of liquidity or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment spending or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for our company and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions the availability of outside financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on a variety of factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost and availability of funding may be adversely 16indexaffected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specificallyif rjfs credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our relationships with clients such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our incremental borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in one of our credit agreements and certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information as of september 30 2014 furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent for the subsidiaries they supervise see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity riskwe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuerin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidityour venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk17indexwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers market making and underwriting businesses exposing us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities loans and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses  we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged in the case of aged securities failed to receive we may under industry regulations purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty also we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity could result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including but not limited to campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit and margin and nonpurpose loans collateralized by securities we incur credit risk through our investments which include mbs collateralized mortgage obligations auction rate securities and other municipal securitiesour credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to a natural disaster act of terrorism severe weather event or economic event could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit riskour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and on advisory feesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly 18indexaffect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management assets under management balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting market making trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold primarily in connection with our market making or underwriting activitiesfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded there is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients furthermore although we do not hold any eu sovereign debt we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the eu sovereign debt circumstances defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty any such losses in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations19indexwe have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilityour business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginsregions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan mattersunder the definitive stock purchase agreement dated january 11 2012 entered into by rjf and regions governing our acquisition of morgan keegan the spa regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify rjf with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters rjf is relying on regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the spa with respect to such matters our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified could result in our incurring significant costs for defense settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and our regulatory capital levelssee note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding these indemnification agreementsgrowth of our business could increase costs and regulatory and integration risksintegrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments if and to the extent they arise from time to time our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growthexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction moreover to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business such acquisitions could be of significant size andor complexity this effort together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings or perhaps at all we face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms hedge funds and others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products

enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure an inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilityour ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals particularly our managing directors and the members of our executive committees as well as employees and financial advisors to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel the reputations and relationships of our senior professionals with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagement competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidityturnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a new or existing competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenuesmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may currently be working for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining uswe are exposed to operational riskour diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems external events including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center operations processing sites or our branches our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses our financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services operational risk exists in every activity function or unit of our business and can take the form of internal or external fraud employment and hiring practices an error in meeting a professional obligation or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our employees engage in misconduct our businesses would be adversely affected operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption system failures or failed transaction processing third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties in addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors including outsourced operationsour business contingency plan in place is intended to ensure we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets including staff and technology in the event of a business interruption despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans due to unforeseen factors our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access catastrophic events including weather related events events involving 21indexelectrical environmental or communications malfunctions as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct businesssee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk associate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harmthere have been a number of highlypublicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry and there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients if our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected our businesses depend on technologyour businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standardsour continued success depends in part upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees failure of our systems which could result from events beyond our control or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory sanctions client and customer public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased thus our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise todate we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future notwithstanding that we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact if one or more of these events occur this could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our clients our counterparties or third parties operations we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulatorsextraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail while we have made investments to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances systems failures and delays could occur and could cause among other things unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire resulting in client dissatisfaction22indexin providing services to clients we may manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the us federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant and depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damagessee item 7a quantitative and

could impact our ability to conduct businesswe are exposed to litigation risksmany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability arising in the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability for us advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor to the extent we fail to know our clients or improperly advise them we could be found liable for losses suffered by such clients which could harm our business our private client group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients investment objectives the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operationsas it pertains to morgan keegan a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition are subject to indemnification from regions refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled regions may fail to honor its indemnification

and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk23indexthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 in this report and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10kin december 2012 the fasb issued a proposed standard on accounting for credit losses the standard would replace multiple existing impairment models including replacing an incurred loss model for loans with an expected loss model the fasb announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard we cannot predict whether or when a final standard will be issued when it will be effective what its final provisions will be or the potential impact its eventual adoption may have on our retained earnings our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we employ limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes further our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to adequately manage our growth or to effectively manage our risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business we have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect our reputation 24indexthe willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this reportwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to a number of risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks in nonus markets our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations andor our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets additionally a political economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generallywe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion of employeerelated health care benefits plans we fund among others while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be

subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actionsfirms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment which we expect will become even more stringent in light of recent wellpublicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators including the sec the nyse finra the occ the cfpb the fed and state attorneys general penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services including but not limited to the authority to fine us and to grant cancel restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to carry on particular businesses for example a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the exchange act on brokerdealers and the investment advisers act on investment advisers including recordkeeping advertising and operating requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities or by the investment company act of 1940 could result in investigations sanctions and reputational damage we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or finra or other selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have adverse financial effects on us or cause reputational harm to us which could harm our business prospectschanges in regulations resulting from either the doddfrank act or any new regulations may affect our businessesthe market and economic conditions over the past several years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry including significant additional legislation and regulation in the 25indexus and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry see item 1 regulation in this report for a discussion of such changes including the volcker rule the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act will have on us the financial industry and the economy cannot be known until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and implemented these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of assets that we hold require us to change certain of our business practices impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businessesthe doddfrank act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which while not currently anticipated to could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our business include but are not limited to the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds outlined in the doddfrank act these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has been active in investigating products services and operations of credit providers including banks for compliance with various laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act and the real estate settlement procedures act any actions taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make them less attractive restrict our ability to offer them or increase our regulatory and compliance costs to the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with usin december 2013 the final version of the volcker rule was adopted see item 1 regulation in this report for discussion of the volcker rule although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of trading for our own account due to our underwriting and market making activities the volcker rule will likely increase our operational and compliance costs and may reduce our trading revenues require a change in our principal capital private equity investments and as a result adversely affect our results of operationsthe sec recently adopted amendments most of which were effective october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries such impact could have an adverse effect on certain of our brokerdealer subsidiariesthe basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and

the rule becomes effective for us january 1 2015 subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both rj bank and rjf the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affectedfailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action rjf and rj bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices rjfs and rj banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to riskweighted assets and tier i capital to adjusted assets as defined in the regulations failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and our financial condition26indexas more fully discussed in item 1 regulation in this report rjf is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the fed while we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capitaladditionally as rjf is a holding company it depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including among others debt service we are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and the net capital rule of finra which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements in addition our canada based brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligationssee note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on regulations and capital requirementswe operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionthe securities

trading methods trade practices among brokerdealers use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts record keeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees if laws or regulations are violated we could be subject to one or more of the following civil liability criminal liability sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operationswe are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements including the maintenance of certain riskbased regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses however due to our strong current capital position we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities see the section entitled business  regulation of item 1 in this report for additional informationas a financial holding company we are regulated by the fed rj bank is regulated by the occ the fed the cfpb and the fdic this oversight includes but is not limited to scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations the sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares the staff of the office of compliance inspections and examinations has indicated that it is reviewing use of fund assets to pay for fees to subtransfer agents and subadministrators for services that may be deemed to be distributionrelated any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry the impact of changes such as those currently proposed cannot be predicted at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds investment advisors and brokerdealers some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as an investment advisor with the sec and the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities it is impossible 27indexto determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to brokerdealers however any such standard if mandated would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and result in changes to these and require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliancein addition in recent years the us and other governments have taken actions and may continue to take further actions including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries and in particular our investment management business for example several states and municipalities in the united states have recently adopted paytoplay rules which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees and could therefore affect the profitability of that portion of our business in addition the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors is periodically reexamined and may in the future be limited or modified although a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts external research including external research paid for with soft dollars is important to the process this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as third party provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars is limited we may have to bear some of these costs furthermore new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs for example many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund businesses or other businesses and changes to the laws rules and regulations in the us related to the overthecounter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration recordkeeping and reporting obligationssee the section entitled business  regulation within item 1 in this report for additional information

financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2014 compared with the year ended september 30 2013 for the fifth consecutive year we achieved record net revenues of 49 billion a 376 million or 8 increase compared to the prior year the increase generated by our ongoing operations is even greater than that amount after factoring in the 74 million of revenue reflected in the prior year that was associated with a private equity investment we sold last year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues the fifth straight year for our private client group and capital markets segments total client assets under administration increased to 475 billion at september 30 2014 a 12 increase over the prior year level we also achieved a record level of net income to 480 million an increase of 113 million or 31 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 332 increased 074 or 29 over the prior year amount after excluding the acquisition related and other onetime expenses we incurred in the prior year our adjusted net income increased 61 million or 15 compared to the prior year period a nongaap measure1 the increase in net income over the prior year level is even more significant given that the prior year net income included 14 million after the attribution to noncontrolling interests arising from our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion a private equity holding which was sold during the prior yearnoninterest expenses increased 254 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses which were partially offset by the decrease in acquisition related expenses acquisition and integration related expenses in fiscal year 2014 are no longer material for separate reporting since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the combination of increasing net revenues and overall expense control in fiscal year 2014 helped us achieve a 154 pretax margin on net revenuesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 33 billion a 12 increase while pretax income increased 100 million or 43 to a record 330 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in corresponding commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased by only 1 client assets under administration of the private client group increased 12 over the prior year level to 4506 billion at september 30 2014 net inflows of client assets have been positively impacted by successful recruiting of financial advisors among other favorable factors1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa33indexthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 966 million a 3 increase while pretax income increased 28 million or 28 to a record 131 million increases in trading profits merger and acquisition fee revenues equity underwriting fee revenues and institutional sales commissions on equity products more than offset a decline in institutional sales commissions on fixed income products the decline in institutional fixed income commission revenues results from challenging fixed income market conditions during the fiscal year due to economic uncertainty historically low interest rates relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and decreased customer trading volumes our asset management segment generated record net revenues of 370 million a 26 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 33 to a record 128 million financial assets under management increased 15 from the prior year to 646 billion as of september 30 2014 both strong net inflows of client assets and market appreciation contributed to the increase we also earned nearly 10 million in performance fees in the current year compared to nearly 2 million in the prior year as a result of positive net performance from certain of our managed funds a portion of which are attributable to noncontrolling interests which contributed to the increase in revenues and pretax income rj bank generated record net revenues of 352 million a 1 increase while pretax income decreased 25 million or 9 to 243 million net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding offset in large part by a lower net interest margin the provision for loan losses increased primarily as the result of significant loan portfolio growth partially offset by decreases resulting from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio reflecting the positive impact from improved economic conditions noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses increased 19 millionactivities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that is 48 million less than the prior year our noninterest expenses decreased substantially as we are no longer incurring acquisition and integration related costs since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 in addition the prior year included significant revenues and pretax income associated with our indirect investment in albion which was sold in april 2013 thus having a significant impact on comparisons to the prior year our fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate is 358 up from the 349 in fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings both years included significant nontaxable gains in the value of our companyowned life insurance portfoliothe regulatory environment in which we operate our businesses continues to produce changes that result from new rules and additional regulations that could impact our businesses in the future that being the case our current view of the potential impact to us of future regulations remains substantially unchanged by the regulatory activities that occurred during the year based on our continuing review of the doddfrank act and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole however because some of the implementing regulations either have yet to be adopted have yet to become effective or are under further analysis by various regulatory agencies the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain 34indexyear ended september 30 2013 compared with the year ended september 30 2012we achieved record net revenues of 45 billion in fiscal year 2013 a 679 million or 18 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record net revenues and pretax earnings revenues were higher in fiscal year 2013 in part because the results include twelve months of morgan keegan operations as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012 in addition fiscal year 2013 net revenues include a 65 million gain on a proprietary capital investment a 227 million impact to rjf net revenues after noncontrolling interests which further elevated our revenues our pretax income increased 93 million in fiscal year 2013 or 20 compared to the prior year to 564 million excluding the acquisition related expenses primarily resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition in fiscal year 2013 we generated adjusted pretax income of 644 million a nongaap measure1 a 21 increase over the prior year earnings per share in fiscal year 2013 increased 17 over the prior year to 258 per share excluding the acquisition related expenses mentioned above fiscal year 2013 adjusted earnings per share a nongaap measure1 increased 18 to 295 per share all of our operating segments performed well during fiscal year 2013 as each achieved record levels of pretax income total client assets under administration were a record 4254 billion at september 30 2013 a 10 increase over the prior year level noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 553 million or 17 primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of expenses from legacy morgan keegan businesses increases in compensation related expenses information technology expenses and acquisition related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the bank loan loss provisionsignificant milestones achieved in fiscal year 2013 include the midfebruary 2013 transfer of all of the morgan keegan financial advisors and client accounts from the morgan keegan platform to the rjampa platform following that conversion and allowing time for the former morgan keegan financial advisors to become proficient in the use of the rjampa platform in the june 2013 quarter we implemented staff reductions these reductions occurred mainly within our information technology groups where there was significant overlap in historic morgan keegan and rjampa support staffing that we had elected to maintain through the platform conversion date in order to ensure the continued high levels of service to financial advisors and clients while we operated on two different platforms retention levels remain very high for the legacy morgan keegan financial advisors the morgan keegan capital markets businesses were also integrated primarily fixed income and public finance investment banking during fiscal year 2013 and further staff reductions were made given these accomplishments as of september 30 2013 our various morgan keegan integration initiatives have been substantially and successfully completeda summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year in addition to the impact of twelve months of morgan keegan operations in fiscal year 2013 compared to six months in the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 29 billion in fiscal year 2013 an 18 increase while pretax income increased 7 to 230 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts pretax income in fiscal year 2013 was negatively impacted by an increase in commission expenses driven primarily by the increase in corresponding commission revenues as well as an increase in communication and information processing expense client assets under administration of the private client group increased 9 over the prior year to 4026 billion at september 30 2013 the capital markets segment generated net revenues of 938 million in fiscal year 2013 a 15 increase while pretax income increased 35 to 102 million we experienced significant increases in institutional fixed income commission revenues merger and acquisition fees and fixed income investment banking revenues equity capital markets commission levels increased as a result of improved equity market conditions results from our equity capital markets investment banking business were uneven throughout fiscal year 2013 characterized by intermittent periods of significant activity and ending the year with strong results our fixed income operations improved overall but were negatively impacted during times of adverse fixed income market conditions these adverse conditions resulted from medium and longer term interest rate volatility which negatively impacted our trading results our asset management segment generated revenues of 293 million in fiscal year 2013 a 23 increase while pretax income increased 43 to 96 million assets under management in managed programs increased 31 to a record 56 billion as of september 30 2013 strong net inflows of client assets in managed programs including from legacy mk amp co branches market appreciation and our acquisition of an interest in clarivest contributed to the increase 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa35indexrj bank generated 268 million in pretax income in fiscal year 2013 an 11 increase over the prior year the increase resulted primarily from the significant decrease in the loan loss provision expense and an increase in net interest income the decrease in the loan loss provision expense resulted from an improved credit environment the favorable resolution of certain problem loans and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in average loans outstanding in our nonoperating other segment our fiscal year 2013 results reflect a 6 million increase in our pretax loss this segment includes certain corporate expenses our principal capital and our private equity activities our results were favorably impacted by the sale of our indirect investment in albion in april 2013 the albion investment generated an increase of 18 million in pretax income net of noncontrolling interests we also experienced other less significant increases on other investments in our private equity portfolio those increases were more than offset by additional acquisition and integration related costs incurred from the morgan keegan acquisition and a full years interest expense associated with debt financings executed in march 2012 to finance a portion of the acquisitionour earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 decreased to 349 from 373 in fiscal year 2012 the tax rate decrease primarily resulted from a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings as well as a significant increase

interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankbased upon our latest analysis performed as of september 30 2014 we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates would result in an increase in our pretax income of approximately 150 million over a twelve month period approximately half of such an increase would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2014 and a conservative assumption related to interest credited to our clients on their cash balances in such an interest rate environment the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the vast majority of any incremental benefit to pretax income from a rise in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume that a significant portion of any further incremental increase in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense 39indexthe following table presents our consolidated average interestearning asset and liability

fees increased 303 million or 12 the increase results predominately from growth in client assets under administration the year over year increase in client assets was driven by the equity market conditions in the us which were generally improved as compared to the prior year and increased financial advisor productivity the most significant increases in these revenues arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 245 million or 24 and commission revenues on mutual fund products which increased 57 million or 9 primarily due to increases in trailing commissions on mutual fund products partially offset by a 21 million or 21 decrease in commissions on fixed income products commission earnings on fixed income products decreased primarily due to historically low

implement changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements during fiscal year 2014 we implemented

our midfebruary 2013 platform integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs resulting in an increase in this fee revenuepcg net interest increased 4 million or 5 primarily resulting from an increase in margin interest rates despite a slight decrease in average margin balances growth in margin loans in fiscal year 2014 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our securities based lending product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2014 and the related low net interest spreads earned there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash balances refer to the discussion of how the pretax income of

accounts from the mk amp co platform were transferred to and integrated with the rjampa platformsecurities commissions and fees in fiscal year 2013 increased 399 million or 19 a significant portion of

morgan keegan operations into those of rjampa securities commissions and fee revenues generated by our canadian operations increased 6 over the prior year despite a small decrease in the total number

fee revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased 13 million or 9 over the prior year the increase primarily results from an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program balances in this program increased primarily as a result of the transfer of mk amp co client accounts to the raymond james program additional mk amp co client accounts also resulted in an increase in service fee income which increased as a result of the additional client account volume in addition we realized an increase in fees resulting from assets invested in alternative

platform integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs further increasing this revenuepartially offsetting the increases in revenues described in the preceding two paragraphs client transaction fees in fiscal year 2013 decreased 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting during fiscal year 2013 to a ntf program and an april 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain nondiscretionary assetbased programs under the mutual fund ntf program we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs other revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased by 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of spreads earned on crosscurrency transactions within our canadian operations

consistent with the 19 increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 61 million or 14 this increase resulted primarily from the impact of a full year of salaries and benefits expense associated with the increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of the morgan keegan associates communications and information processing expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 49 million or 43 computer software development costs and other information technology related costs which include consulting expenses increased over 42 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms costs associated with operating two platforms for a portion of the year additional reporting requirements including regulatory requirements and expenses associated with omnibus arrangements refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above occupancy and equipment expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 18 million or 19 primarily due to a full years rent and other facility related expenses associated with the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition clearance and other expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 27 million or 38 these expense increases can generally be attributed to clearing and floor brokerage expenses resulting from the additional volume of client accounts and transactions arising

the active new issue market resulted in a 14 increase in equity underwriting fee revenues to 100 million underwriting fee revenues increased in both our domestic as well as our canadian equity capital markets operations the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 were real estate financial services and energyinstitutional fixed income sales commissions decreased 81 million or 25 primarily due to the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2014 resulting from economic uncertainty the continuation of historically low interest rates periods of relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and the resulting decreased customer trading volumes despite such conditions trading results were solid and steady during the year resulting in a 32 million or 112 improvement over the 46indexprior year which included a quarter the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 which was particularly negative these

technology services healthcare energy financial services technology and general industrialstax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased by 10 million or 40 due to a 16 increase in the volume of

benefit expense increased 25 million or 6 compared to the prior year offset by a decrease in sales commission expense of 30 million or 13 which is directly correlated with the 12 decrease in overall institutional sales commission revenues incentive compensation expense increases are primarily the result of higher volumes of underwriting mergers amp acquisitions and advisory fees investment banking and tax credit fund syndication fee revenues as well as to a lesser extent annual salary increases applicable to all of our operations the prior year included goodwill impairment expense of 7 million related to our rjes operations which did not recur in the current year losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome

operations with morgan keegans fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business net revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased by 126 million or 15 total institutional sales commissions increased 15 over the prior year equity institutional sales commissions increased 17 million or 7 primarily due to improved equity market conditions the 60 million or 22 increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions over the prior year is primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations after the morgan keegan acquisition and the inclusion of twelve months of 47indexthe combined entities operations in the current year as compared to only six months in the prior year our significantly larger public finance fixed income operations as a result of the morgan keegan acquisition favorably impacted both our investment banking revenues and our securities commissions and fees the number of lead and comanaged equity underwritings as well as merger amp acquisition transactions during fiscal year 2013 increased significantly in our us operations as compared to the prior year in the latter part of the first quarter of our fiscal 2013 concerns related to the then pending fiscal cliff crisis had at least in part a favorable impact on our equity capital markets business as underwriting and merger and acquisition activity improved significantly as issuers sought to complete certain equity transactions in advance of any anticipated tax law changes the activity levels experienced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 slowed considerably thereafter until a very active fourth quarter for fiscal year 2013 the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of merger and acquisition fees were technology services energy technology financial services healthcare and general industrials capital markets activities in our canadian operations have remained sluggish throughout fiscal year 2013 continuing to reflect the adverse market conditions which existed throughout the prior fiscal year particularly in the businesses in which we focus such as natural resourcesthe primary contributor to our fixed income investment banking revenues in fiscal year 2013 is our public finance investment banking operations the volume of our lead and comanaged public finance underwritings increased significantly over the prior year this favorable comparison is in part due to the positive impact of the inclusion of the public finance operations we acquired from morgan keegan in our results for an entire yearthe decrease in tax credit syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2013 results from an increase in the amount of fee revenues that have been deferred to be recognized at later dates upon completion of certain revenue recognition criteria the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during fiscal year 2013 is slightly higher than in the prior yeardespite our increase in fixed income trading capacity resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition our trading profit results for fiscal year 2013 while positive overall were unfavorably impacted by adverse conditions in the municipal fixed income market this market was impacted during fiscal year 2013 by a number of factors municipal fixed income markets were negatively impacted during the first quarter by discussions and rumors regarding potential changes in the tax laws pertaining to limits or caps on the taxexempt advantages of municipal fixed income instruments the fiscal cliff in response to these uncertainties interest rates on municipal securities increased during december 2012 which negatively impacted our trading results during the third quarter the 10year benchmark interest rate increased over 60 basis points in a very short period of time may through june 30 2013 resulting in very little demand for municipal fixed income securities in the market and valuation losses on municipal securities held in inventory which negatively impacted our third quarter trading results during the fourth quarter interest rates retreated somewhat back to their early may 2013 levels and our trading results were strong especially in municipal products during that period all of these factors considered in conjunction with what were strong municipal fixed income trading results in the prior year resulted in unfavorable trading profits in yearoveryear comparisonsnoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 101 million or 13 over the prior year primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 41 million or 22 which is correlated with the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 15 and includes the impact of the shift to a higher proportion of commissions being fixed income sales which are paid higher commissions including certain retentionrelated expenses implemented as part of the morgan keegan acquisition administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 39 million or 10 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel from the morgan keegan acquisition communications and information processing expense increased 7 million or 13 as a result of new technology initiatives and a full year of morgan keegan expenses goodwill impairment expense associated with rjes of 7 million see discussion below and a 6 million increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities discussed below contributed to the increase in other expense these increases are partially offset by a decrease in clearance and other expense of 5 million or 9 the decrease results primarily from the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between the capital markets and the pcg segments within rjampa as compared to the historic mk amp co operations which favorably impact prior year comparisons refer to the pcg results of operations herein for a discussion of an offsetting unfavorable prior year comparison within that segmentduring the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 we incurred impairment expense associated with the rjes operations of 69 million however since we did not own 100 of rjes as of march 31 2013 23 million of this expense is attributable to others and is included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests amount attributable to others therefore the net impact of this goodwill impairment on the pretax results after consideration of amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests is 46 million refer to the goodwill section of this item 7 and note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on this goodwill impairment expense48indexlosses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds since we only hold an insignificant interest in these consolidated funds nearly all of these losses are attributable to others and are therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on the consolidation of vies  noncontrolling interests include the consolidation of rjes for periods prior to april 2013 the period in which we acquired the interests previously held by others as well as the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which impacts other revenue interest expense and losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies as described in the previous paragraph by including the portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own total segment expenses attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal year 2013 increased by 2 million as compared to the prior year in part as a result

average loans with average corporate loans increasing 11 billion or 17 and average sbl increasing 337 million or 76 the net interest margin decreased to 298 from 325 primarily as a result of the decrease in the yield of the average interestearning assets the yield on interestearning banking assets decreased to 304 from 334 due to a decline in the loan portfolio yield the loan portfolio yield decreased primarily due to a reduction in the corporate loan portfolio yield resulting from lower yields on new loans and refinancings as well as lower corporate loan fee income the residential mortgage loan portfolio yield declined due to adjustable rate loans resetting at lower ratescorresponding to the increase in average interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 12 billion to 105 billionthe decrease in other income as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 3 million decline in gains from the sale of held for sale loans due to lower residential mortgage loan originations and a 2 million increase in foreign currency losses which were partially offset by a 2 million increase in bankowned life insurance valuation gainsthe

impact from improved economic conditions which have resulted in a decline in the criticized loan balance and nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets in addition net loan chargeoffs decreased 12 million or 87 to 2 million which was primarily attributable to improved credit characteristics within both the cre and residential mortgage loan portfoliosthe 19 million increase in

increase of 11 million or 3 in net revenues and a 23 million or 90 decrease in the provision for loan losses offset by a 7 million or 9 increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses the 11 million increase in net revenues was attributable to a 17 million increase in net interest income partially offset by a 6 million decrease in other income  net interest income in fiscal year 2013 increased 17 million or 5 primarily as a result of a 13 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets this increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 11 billion increase in average loans as well as increases in both average investments and cash the significant increase in average loans resulted from a strong corporate lending market including our canadian lending operation which began in late february 2012 and growth in the recently introduced securities based lending product the yield on interestearning banking assets decreased to 334 from 361 due to declines in both the loan and investment yields the loan portfolio yield decreased to 386 from 420 due to a reduction in the corporate loan portfolio yield resulting from tightened credit spreads and the repricing of existing loans at lower rates in addition the yield of the residential mortgage loan portfolio declined as a result of adjustable rate loans resetting at lower rates as well as lower rates on new production primarily as a result of the decrease in the yield of the average interestearning assets the net interest margin decreased to 325 from 350corresponding to the increase in interestearning banking assets in fiscal year 2013 average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 12 billion to 93 billion  the decrease in other income in fiscal year 2013

by this segment decreased by approximately 48 million or 37 compared to the prior yearnet revenues in this segment decreased 81 million or 177 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in the current year arising from our private equity portfolio investments approximately 74 million of prior year revenues were associated with our indirect investment in albion an investment which was sold in april 2013 and therefore such revenues did not recur in the current year revenues associated with the remainder of our private equity portfolio have decreased 6 million compared to the prior year offsetting these decreases we realized a 6 million increase in the current year from gains on redemptions or sales of ars most notably arising from the current year redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars noninterest expenses decreased 74 million or 63 the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in acquisition related expenses since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the acquisition related expenses incurred in the prior year were primarily comprised of expenses associated with the integration of morgan keegans operations into our own see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on the components of the prior year expense the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased by nearly 56 million compared to the prior year of the prior year albion revenues received approximately 51 million

2013 increased by approximately 6 million or 4total revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased 68 million or 116 the increase primarily resulted from a 44 million increase in other revenues associated with our indirect investment in albion which was sold in april 2013 fiscal year 2013 includes 74 million of favorable valuation adjustments and distributions received from albion 65 million of favorable valuation adjustments and 9 million of dividends received compared to 30 million of favorable valuation adjustments and dividends received on 60indexalbion in the prior fiscal year revenues resulting from either distributions received or valuation adjustments related to certain private equity investments we acquired as part of the morgan keegan acquisition increased 16 million over the prior year interest expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 18 million or 29 over the prior year the increase primarily results from our march 2012 issuances of 350 million 69 senior notes and 250 million 5625 senior notes as well as interest expense associated with borrowings under certain credit agreements with regions bank as more fully described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated

compensation expense the noncontrolling interest line item captures the pretax income generated from investments included in this segment of which we do not own 100 the income before tax attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal year 2013 increased 34 million over the prior year this increase primarily resulted from the increase in revenues generated from the albion investment which resulted in a 26 million increase over the prior year in the attribution of pretax income to others the remaining 8 million increase over the prior year resulted from increases in the pretax income

our capital structure our overall risk management business diversification and our market share and competitive position in the markets in which we operate deteriorations in any of these factors could impact our credit ratings any rating downgrades could increase our costs in the event we were to pursue obtaining additional financingshould our credit rating be downgraded prior to a public debt offering it is probable that we would have to offer a higher rate of interest to bond holders a downgrade to below investment grade may make a public debt offering difficult to execute on terms we would consider to be favorable one of our committed secured financing agreements having a maximum borrowing in the amount of 100 million includes as an event of default the failure of rjf as a guarantor of the repayment of the loan to maintain an investment grade rating on its unsecured senior debt otherwise none of our credit agreements contain a condition or event of default related to our credit ratings a downgrade below investment grade could also result in the termination of certain derivative contracts and the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k

liquiditystatement of financial condition analysisthe assets on our consolidated statement of financial condition consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents a large portion of which is segregated for the benefit of clients receivables including bank loans financial instruments held for either trading purposes or as investments and other assets a significant portion of our assets are liquid in nature providing us with flexibility in financing our business total assets of 233 billion at september 30 2014 are approximately 140 million or 1 more than our total assets as of september 30 2013 net bank loans receivable increased 21 billion due to significant growth of rj banks net loan portfolio during the year offsetting this increase segregated assets pursuant to federal regulations at september 30 2014 decreased 158 billion compared to september 30 2013 resulting from an increase during the current year in the capacity of the unaffiliated banks who participate in our rjbdp to accept client cash balances under the program with the increase in rjbdp capacity we increased the client cash balances redeposited with such unaffiliated banks which reduces the amount of brokerage client liabilities carried on our financial statements securities purchased under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings decreased 263 million as rj ltd reduced its amount of secured call loans receivable which is considered to be an other collateralized financing and redirected such shortterm investments to cash deposits with large canadian financial institutions which are included in our cash balance the investment balance associated with our available for sale securities portfolio decreased 137 million primarily as a result of redemptions maturations or sales of certain securities in the portfolio receivables from brokersdealers and clearing organizations decreased 136 million as certain receivable balances associated with our brokerdealer subsidiaries in the normal course of their businesses which were outstanding as of september 30 2013 were settled during the year and did not recur cash and cash equivalents decreased 398 million refer to the discussion of the various sources and uses of cash during the period in the preceding liquidity and capital resources section of this mdampa our liabilities at september 30 2014 of 189 billion are 295 million or 2 less than our liabilities as of september 30 2013 the decrease in liabilities at september 30 2014 compared to september 30 2013 is primarily due to the following a 199 billion decrease in brokerage client payables which occurred due to the increase in capacity with unaffiliated banks in our rjbdp program and the resultant increase in client cash balances that were redeposited with unaffiliated banks which reduces the amount of brokerage client payable balances carried on our financial statements refer to the related decrease in segregated assets pursuant to federal regulations discussed in the preceding paragraph offsetting the decrease bank deposit liabilities increased 734 million reflecting increased deposits at rj bank and our net borrowings increased by 571 million primarily

business activitiessee note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on regulatory and capital requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosuresfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs 69indexcertain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentslevel 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2014 9 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilities are instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are nearly unchanged from such measures as of september 30 2013financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 417 million as of september 30 2014 and represent 21 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2014 our private equity investments comprise 212 million or 51 of the total and our ars positions comprise 201 million or 48 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 52 million or 11 as compared to the september 30 2013 level primarily as a result of sales and redemptions of ars which generated proceeds of 512 million and a gain of 71 million in the year ended september 30 2014 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information level 3 assets represent 94 of total equity as of september 30 2014 reflecting a decrease from the 117 of total equity measure as of september 30 2013financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount to 58 thousand as of september 30 2014 and represent less than 1 of liabilities measured at fair value which is unchanged from such measure at september 30 2013valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2014 and 2013 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2014 are described below70indextrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2014 7 our gross trading security assets and 70 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2014 93 our gross trading security assets and 30 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2014 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 71indexavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 64 of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 36 is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchydebt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive loss income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most senior nonagency securities at september 30 2014 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security72indexfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments and comprise 51 of all of our level 3 assets as of september 30 2014 the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with third parties andor discounted cash flow models incorporating changes in market outlook investments in funds structured as limited partnerships are generally valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets of the partnership as provided by the fund manager investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchygoodwill impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2014 we performed a qualitative assessment evaluating the balances as of december 31 2013 for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we

this form 10k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of september 30 2014the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2014 includes 16 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators annual shared national credit snc examination the snc exam included a review which represented 83 of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time the impact of the snc exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam we incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual snc exam into our internal ratings methodology the limited number of loans with ratings differences the lengthy period between snc exams and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any years exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings based on these factors however we do not believe the snc exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed rather are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year we do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the snc exam thus based on this policy the results of the annual snc exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known given the relatively high percentage of snc loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio the impact from each annual snc exam may be material to any fiscal years provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous significant meaning more than a one notch classification change or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2013 included 56 million resulting from the impact of the respective periods annual snc exam this prior year exam included a review which which represented 80 of the total held for investment corporate loan portfolio at such time at september 30 2014 the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was 111 billion and an allowance for loan losses of 1476 million was recorded against that balance the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 133 of the amortized cost of the loan portfoliothe uncertainty of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank74indexincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the

monitor on a daily basis the valueatrisk var for all of our trading portfolios var is an appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence levelwe apply the feds market risk rule mrr for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios the mrr requires us to extend the calculation of var for all of our trading portfolios including equity and derivative instruments to calculate var we use historical simulation this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions are representative of future changes the simulation is based upon daily market data for the previous twelve months var is reported at a 99 confidence level based on a oneday time horizon this means that we could expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by the var estimates only once in every 100 trading days or about 25 times a year on average over the course of time we have chosen the historical period of twelve months to be representative of the current interest rate and equity markets we utilize stress testing to complement our var analysis so as to measure risk under historical and hypothetical adverse scenarios var results are indicative of relatively recent changes in general interest rates and equity markets and are not designed to capture historical stress periods beyond the twelve month historical period back testing procedures performed include comparing projected var results to regulatorydefined daily trading losses which excludes fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading as required by the mrr we then verify that the number of times that regulatorydefined daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99 confidence level during the year ended september 30 2014 the reported regulatorydefined daily loss in our trading portfolios did not exceed the predicted var on any trading dayshould markets suddenly become more volatile actual trading losses may exceed var results presented on a single day and might accumulate over a longer time horizon such as a number of consecutive trading days accordingly management applies additional controls including position limits a daily review of trading results review of the status of aged inventory independent controls on pricing monitoring of concentration risk and review of issuer ratings as well as stress testing during volatile markets we may choose to pare our trading inventories to reduce risk the following table sets forth the high low and daily average var for all of our trading portfolios including fixed income equity and derivative instruments as of the period and dates indicated  year ended september 30

approximations while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different var estimates as a result var statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences

earning asset portfolio rj bank is subject to interest rate risk the current economic environment has led to an extended period of low market interest rates as a result the majority of rj banks adjustable rate assets and liabilities have experienced a reduction in interest rate yields and costs that reflect these very low market interest rates during the year rj bank has focused its interest rate risk analysis on the risk of market interest rates rising rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both in a range of interest rate scenariosone of the objectives of rj banks asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right but not the obligation to repay before the scheduled maturity to ensure that rj bank is within its limits established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios rj bank utilizes an internally developed assetliability model using standard industry software to analyze the available data the model estimates changes in net interest income by calculating interest income and interest expense from existing assets and liabilities using current repricing prepayment and volume assumptions various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest

requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will renege on the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss however most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed we offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss in the event that such borrower declares bankruptcy or is no longer affiliated with us historically such losses have not been significant due to our strong advisor retention and successful collection effortswe are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the us government or its agencies receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made including underwritings may involve exposure to individual

business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre construction loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as described above in addition project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segmenttaxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentresidential mortgage

in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors during fiscal year 2014 corporate profit levels continued to improve but have remained weak as compared to historic levels unemployment rates have declined but remain high retail sales continue to be sluggish and credit quality trends while improved in some sectors remain somewhat tenuous the volatility in residential home values in certain geographies has continued to have an impact on residential mortgage loan performance all of these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs however during fiscal year 2014 corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september 30 2014 including the risk profile of the portfolios net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio rj bank further stratified the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio based upon updated ltv estimates with higher reserve percentages allocated to the higher ltv loans finally rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio rj bank determined the allowance that was required for specific loan grades based on relative risk

exceptions these qualitative measures while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any quantitative adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates in addition to historical loss rates one other quantitative factor utilized for the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio is updated ltv ratiosrj bank obtains the most recently available information generally on a quarter lag to estimate current ltv ratios on the individual loans in the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio current ltv ratios are estimated based on the initial appraisal obtained at the time of origination adjusted using relevant market indices for housing price changes that have occurred 86indexsince origination the value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to change in the condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within current valuation indices and other factorsthe current average estimated ltv is approximately 60 for the total residential mortgage loan portfolio residential mortgage loans with estimated ltvs between 100 and 120 represent only 2 of the residential mortgage loan portfolio and residential mortgage loans with estimated ltvs in excess of 120 represent less than 1 of the residential mortgage loan portfolio credit risk management utilizes this data in conjunction with

agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements both reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financings and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest our policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under the reverse repurchase agreements to ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient the securities are valued daily and cash is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when contractually required these reverse repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations other collateralized financings include secured call loans receivable held by rj ltd these financings represent loans of excess cash to financial institutions which are fully collateralized by canadian treasury bills or provincial obligations and bear interest at call loan ratesfinancial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased and fair valuefinancial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement datein determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurementslevel 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securitieslevel 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mortgagebacked securities mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include 102indexequity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include auction rate securities ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrumentwe offset our long and short positions for a particular security recorded at fair value as part of our trading instruments long positions and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased short positions when the long and short positions have identical committee on uniform security identification procedures numbers cusipsvaluation techniques the fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2014 and 2013 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading instruments are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries these instruments are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period net incomewhen available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of our trading securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieswhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsthe fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy103indexrj bank maintains a trading portfolio of certain corporate loans that it originates through the primary syndication market these trading instruments are recognized as of the trade date and are carried at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses reflected in net trading profit these trading instruments are valued using quotes from a third party pricing service these third party pricing service quotes are based on current market data provided by multiple dealers the instruments are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the market inputs utilized by the third party pricing service are based upon observable inputspositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyincluded within trading instruments or trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are to be announced tba security contracts with investors for generic mbs securities at specific rates and prices to be delivered on settlement dates in the future these tbas are entered into by rjampa as a component of a hedging strategy to hedge interest rate risk that it would otherwise be exposed to as part of a program its fixed income public finance operations offers to certain state and local housing finance agencies hfa under this program rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase government national mortgage association gnma or federal national home mortgage association fnma mbs the mbs securities are issued on behalf of various hfa clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs rjampas forward gnma or fnma mbs purchase commitments arise at the time of the loan reservation for a borrower in the hfa lending program these loan reservations fix the terms of the mortgage including the interest rate and maximum principal amount the underlying terms of the gnma or fnma mbs purchase including the price for the mbs security which is dependent upon the interest rates associated with the underlying mortgages are also fixed at loan reservation upon acquisition of the mbs security rjampa typically sells such security in open market transactions as part of its fixed income operations given that the actual principal amount of the mbs security is not fixed and determinable at the date of rjampas commitment to purchase these forward mbs purchase commitments do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument these tba securities are accounted for at fair value and are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy the tba securities may aggregate to either a net asset or net liability at any reporting date depending upon market conditions the offsetting purchase commitment is accounted for at fair value and is included in either other assets or other liabilities depending upon whether the tba securities aggregate to a net asset or net liability the fair value of the purchase commitment is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy available for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities interest on the rjf afs securities is recognized in interest income on an accrual basis for the rj bank afs securities discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated remaining life of the security a combination of the level factor and straightline methods is used for such securities the effect of which does not differ materially from the effective interest method when a principal reduction occurs on a rj bank afs security any related premium or discount is recognized as an adjustment to yield in the results of operations in the period in which the principal reduction occursrealized gains and losses on sales of any rjf afs securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are sold104indexunrealized gains or losses on any rjf afs securities except for those that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are recorded through other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aocifor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at a reporting period end we make an assessment whether such securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered in order to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the securitywe intend and have the ability to hold the rjf afs securities to maturity we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these available for sale securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis those securities whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired and are written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in shareholders equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security for any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidity expected principal and interest cash flows on the impaired debt security are discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the time of acquisition the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment otti recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securitythe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were at one time able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy105indexderivative contractswe enter into interest rate swaps and futures contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate client transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account these derivatives are accounted for as trading account assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition any realized or unrealized gains or losses are recorded in net trading profits within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income with any interest earned thereon recorded in interest income the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted bycounterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of these interest rate derivative contracts is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelswe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through nonbrokerdealer subsidiaries either raymond james financial products llc or morgan keegan capital services llc collectively referred to as the raymond james matched book swap subsidiaries or rjss the only difference in the swap businesses conducted by these two subsidiary entities is that they utilize different third party financial institutions to facilitate the offsetting transaction rjss enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with clients of rjampa for every derivative transaction rjss enters into with a client it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the client transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution any collateral required to be exchanged under these derivative contracts is administered directly by the client and the third party financial institution rjss does not hold any collateral or administer any collateral transactions related to these instruments we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rjss recognizes revenue on derivative transactions on the transaction date computed as the present value of the expected cash flows rjss expects to receive from the third party financial institution over the life of the derivative contract the difference between the present value of these cash flows at the date of inception and the gross amount potentially received is accreted to revenue over the term of the contract the revenue from these transactions is included within other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income rj bank enters into threemonth forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of aoci with such balance impacting earnings in the event the net investment is sold or substantially liquidated gains and losses on the undesignated derivative instruments as well as amounts representing hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at each reporting period using a method that is based on changes in forward rates the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the beginning balance of the foreign net investment at the inception of the hedging relationship and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the terms of the hedging instrument and hypothetical derivative match at inception there is no expected ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the forward exchange contracts is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy private equity investmentsprivate equity investments are held primarily in our other segment and consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments employee investment funds and various private equity funds which we sponsor  private equity

consolidation of the raymond james employee investment funds i and ii which are variable interest entities these private funds invest in new and developing companies our investments in these private funds cannot be redeemed directly with the funds our investment is monetized through distributions received through the liquidation of the underlying assets of those funds we estimate that the underlying assets of these funds will be liquidated over the life of these funds typically 10 to 15 years approval by the management of these funds is required for us to sell or transfer these investments merchant banking investments include ownership interests in private companies with longterm growth potential these investments are measured at fair value with any changes recognized in other revenue on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive incomethe valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices

by mk amp co term deposits with canadian financial institutions or investments in other securities arising from the operations of rj ltd and certain investments in limited partnerships or funds for which in a number of instances one of our affiliates serves as the managing member or general partner see note 11 for information regarding such funds certain employees who were at onetime associated with mk amp co participate in deferred compensation plans the balances associated with these plans are invested in certain marketable securities that are held by rjf until the vesting date typically five years from the date of the deferral a liability associated with these deferrals is reflected as a component of our accrued compensation commissions and benefits on our consolidated statements of

receivables include receivables from the clients of our brokerdealer and asset management subsidiaries the receivables from brokerdealer clients are principally for amounts due on cash and margin transactions and are generally collateralized by securities owned by the clients the receivables from asset management clients are primarily for accrued investment advisory fees both the receivables from the asset management and brokerdealer clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts when a brokerdealer receivable is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or brokerdealer price quotations securities beneficially owned by customers including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions are not reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition see note 19 for additional information regarding this collateralwe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting and retention purposes these loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned there is no fee income associated with these loans we assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or 107indexother performance standards in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts related to former employees or independent contractors management primarily considers our historical collection experience as well as other factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship and the former financial advisors overall financial position when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balance of such loan is writtenoff and the corresponding allowance is reduced based upon the nature of these financing receivables we do not analyze this asset on a portfolio segment or class basis further the aging of this receivable balance is not a determinative factor in computing our allowance for doubtful accounts as concerns regarding the recoverability of these loans primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us we present the outstanding balance of loans to financial advisors on our consolidated statements of financial condition net of their applicable allowances for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts balance associated with all of our loans to financial advisors is 25 million and 28 million at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively of the september 30 2014 loans to financial advisors the portion of the balance associated with financial advisors who are no longer affiliated with us after consideration of the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately 46

loans and accounts for these loans in accordance with the policy for loans held for sale rj bank then aggregates sba loans with similar characteristics into pools for securitization and sale to the secondary market individual loans may be sold prior to securitization the determination of the fair value of the sba loans depend upon their intended disposition the fair value of the sba loans to be individually sold are determined based upon their committed sales price the fair value of loans to be aggregated into pools for securitization which are committed to be sold are determined based upon third party price quotes the fair value of all other sba loans are determined using a third party pricing service the prices for the sba loans other than those committed to be individually sold are validated by comparing the third party price quote or the third party pricing service prices as applicable for a sample of loans to observable market trades obtained from external sources once the loans are securitized into a pool the respective securities are classified as trading instruments and are carried at fair value based on rj banks intention to sell the securitizations within the near

recognizes the revenue associated with corporate syndicated standby letters of credit which is generally received quarterly on a cash basis the effect of which does not differ materially from recognizing in the period the fee is earned unused corporate line fees are accounted for on an accrual basisnonperforming assetsnonperforming assets are comprised of both nonperforming loans and oreo nonperforming loans represent those loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status and loans which have been restructured in a manner that grant a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties loans with such restructurings are discussed further below additionally any accruing loans which are 90 days or more past due and in the process of collection are considered nonperforming loansloans of all classes are placed on nonaccrual status when we determine that full payment of all contractual principal and interest is in doubt or the loan is past due 90 days or more as to contractual interest or principal unless the loan in our opinion is wellsecured and in the process of collection when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is written off against interest income and accretion of the net deferred loan origination fees cease interest is recognized using the cash method for sbl and residential first mortgage and home equity loans and the cost recovery method for corporate loans thereafter until the loan qualifies for return to accrual status loans are returned to an accrual status when the loans have been brought contractually current with the original or amended terms and have been maintained on a current basis for a reasonable period generally six monthsother real estate acquired in the settlement of loans including through or in lieu of loan foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs through a charge to the allowance for loan losses thus establishing a new cost basis subsequent to foreclosure valuations are periodically performed by rj bank and the assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value as determined by a current appraisal or valuation less estimated costs to sell and are classified as other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition these nonrecurring fair value measurements are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy costs relating to development and improvement of the property are capitalized whereas those relating to holding the property are charged to operations sales of oreo are recorded as of the settlement date and any associated gains or losses are included in other revenue on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive incometroubled debt restructuringsa loan restructuring is deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring tdr if we for economic or legal reasons related to the borrowers financial difficulties grant a concession we would not otherwise consider in tdrs for all classes of loans the concessions granted such as interest rate reductions generally do not reflect current market conditions for a new loan of similar 109indexrisk made to another borrower in similar financial circumstances other concessions for corporate loans may also include the reduction of the guarantors liability for those restructurings of first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage loans which may reflect current market conditions the concessions granted by rj bank are generally interest capitalization principal forbearance release of liability ordered under chapter 7 bankruptcy not reaffirmed by the borrower or an extension of the interestonly or maturity period first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage tdrs may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of six months of satisfactory performance corporate tdrs have generally been partially chargedoff and therefore remain on nonaccrual status until the loan is fully resolvedimpaired loansloans in all classes are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that rj bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest on a loan when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired rj bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration reasons for the delay the borrowers prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed for individual loans identified as impaired impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate and taking into consideration the factors described below in relation to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses except that as a practical expedient rj bank measures impairment based on the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent impaired loans include all corporate nonaccrual loans all residential mortgage nonaccrual loans for which a chargeoff had previously been recorded and all loans which have been modified in tdrs interest income on impaired loans is recognized consistently with the recognition policy of nonaccrual loansallowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitmentsrj bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when rj bank believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance rj bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflects the assessment of risk considering all available information in developing this assessment rj bank relies on estimates and exercises judgment in evaluating credit risk the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available depending on changes in circumstances future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan lossesthis allowance for loan loss is comprised of two components allowances calculated based on formulas for homogenous classes of loans collectively evaluated for impairment and specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment these homogeneous classes are a result of managements disaggregation of the loan portfolio and are comprised of the previously mentioned classes campi cre cre construction taxexempt residential first mortgage residential home equity and sblthe loans within the corporate classes are assigned to one of several internal loan grades based upon the respective loans credit characteristics the loans within the residential first mortgage residential home equity and sbl classes are assigned loan grades equivalent to the loan classifications utilized by bank regulators dependent on their respective likelihood of loss we assign each loan grade for all loan classes an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that grade the allowance for loan losses for all nonimpaired loans is then calculated based on the reserve percentage assigned to the respective loans class and grade the allowance for loan losses for all impaired loans except those nonaccrual residential first mortgage loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment is based on an individual evaluation of impairment as previously described in the impaired loans section abovethe qualitative and quantitative factors taken into consideration when assigning the loan grades and allowance percentages to the loans within the corporate loan classes include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values trends in delinquencies volume and terms changes in geographic distribution updated loantovalue ltv ratios lending policies experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff local regional national and international economic conditions concentrations of credit risk past loss history shared national credit snc reviews and examination results from bank regulators loan grades for individual corporate loans are derived from analyzing two aspects of the risk factors in a particular loan the obligor rating and the facility collateral rating the obligor rating relates to a borrowers probability of default and the facility rating is utilized to estimate the anticipated loss given default these two ratings which are based on rj banks internal 110indexhistorical loss data or historical longterm industry loss rates where rj bank has limited loss history are considered in combination with certain management adjustments to derive the final corporate loan grades and allowance percentages qualitative factors while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any significant quantitative adjustments to allowance percentagesfor sbl residential first mortgage loan and residential home equity loan classes the qualitative factors considered when assigning allowance percentages include loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements whether the loan is originated or purchased borrower credit scores at origination occupancy ie owner occupied second home or investment property documentation level loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size and loan policy exceptions these qualitative factors while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any quantitative adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates historical loss rates a quantitative factor is utilized when assigning the allowance percentages for sbl residential first mortgage loans and residential home equity loans and are derived from estimates of the probability of default and loss given default severity these estimated loss rates are based on rj banks historical loss data as adjusted by management from the eight quarters prior to the respective quarterend in addition to historical loss rates one other quantitative factor utilized for the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio is updated ltv ratios rj bank segregates the performing loans in the residential loan classes on a quarterly basis based upon updated ltv data rj bank obtains the most recently available information generally on a quarterlag to estimate the current ltv ratios on the individual loans in the residential mortgage loan portfolio current ltvs are estimated on a loan by loan basis utilizing the initial appraisal obtained at the time of origination adjusted for housing price changes that have occurred since origination using current valuation indices the value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to changes in the condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within current valuation indices and other factors the product of the default and loss severity percentages is then applied to the balance of residential first mortgages and residential home equity loan balances which have been further stratified by updated ltv in order to calculate the related allowance for loan lossesas tdrs regardless of the loan portfolio segment or accrual status are impaired loans rj bank evaluates its credit risk on an individual loan basis the amount of impairment recorded on these loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if collateral dependent based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell in addition all redefaults 60 or more days delinquent subsequent to the loans modification date on tdrs are factored into each portfolio segments allowance for loan losses qualitative information such as geographic area and industry for tdrs and redefaulted tdrs is considered and reviewed in the determination of expected loss rates as discussed aboverj bank reserves for potential losses inherent in its unfunded lending commitments using a methodology similar to that used for loans in the respective portfolio segment based upon loan grade and expected funding probabilities for fully binding commitments this will result in some reserve variability over different periods depending upon the mix of the loan portfolio at the time and future funding expectations all classes of impaired loans which have unfunded lending commitments are analyzed in conjunction with the impaired reserve process described above loan chargeoff policiescorporate loans are monitored on an individual basis and loan grades are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure they reflect the loans current credit risk when rj bank determines that it is likely a corporate loan will not be collected in full the loan is evaluated for potential impairment after consideration of the borrowers ability to restructure the loan alternative sources of repayment and other factors affecting the borrowers ability to repay the debt the portion of the loan deemed to be a confirmed loss if any is chargedoff for collateraldependent loans secured by real estate the amount of the loan considered a confirmed loss and chargedoff is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the collaterals appraised value less estimated costs to sell in instances where the individual loan under evaluation is agented by another bank and where the agent bank has not ordered a timely update of an outdated appraisal rj bank may make adjustments to previous appraised values for purposes of calculating specific reserves or taking partial chargeoffs these impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we evaluate on an ongoing basis all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation certain factors such as guarantor recourse additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals in its ongoing evaluation of each individual loan rj bank may consider more frequent appraisals in locations where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility for campi and taxexempt loans rj bank evaluates all sources of repayment including the estimated liquidation value of collateral to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and chargedoff corporate banking and credit risk managers also hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans loans that 111indexare rated special mention or worse as defined by bank regulators see note 9 for further discussion additional chargeoffs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flowsthe majority of rj banks corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in either sncs or other large syndicated loans in the us or canada the sncs are us loan syndications totaling over 20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions most snc loans are reviewed annually by the agent banks regulator a process in which the other participating banks have no involvement once the snc annual regulatory review process is complete rj bank receives a summary of the review of these snc credits from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ this summary includes a synopsis of each loans regulatory classification loans that are designated for nonaccrual status and directed chargeoffs rj bank must be at least as critical with nonaccrual designations directed chargeoffs and classifications as the occ this ensures that each bank participating in a snc loan rates the loan at least as critical any classification changes may impact rj banks reserves and chargeoffs during the quarter that the snc information is received from the occ however these differences in classifications are generally minimal given the size of the snc loan portfolio the amount of such adjustments depend upon the classification and whether rj bank had the loan classified differently either more or less critically than the snc review findings and therefore could result in higher lower or no change in loan loss provisions than previously recorded rj bank incorporates into its ratings process any observed regulatory trends in the annual snc exam process but there will inherently be differences of opinion on individual credits due to the high degree of judgment involved with respect to its ongoing credit evaluation process of the snc portfolio rj bank conforms to what it believes will be the regulators view of individual creditsevery residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due is reviewed by rj bank personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status appraised value and other data points rj bank senior management meets monthly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoffwritedown recommendations on every residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due with chargeoffs considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and then generally taken before the loan is 120 days past due a chargeoff is taken against the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that rj bank estimates will ultimately be collected based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell rj bank predominantly uses broker price opinions bpo for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the collection and foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed bpos contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace and therefore we have found these bpos to be reasonable determinants of market value in lieu of appraisals and more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values a full appraisal is obtained postforeclosure rj bank takes further chargeoffs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original bpo but does not reverse previously chargedoff amounts if the appraisal is higher than the original bpo if a loan remains in preforeclosure status for more than nine months an updated valuation is obtained and further chargeoffs are taken against the allowance for loan losses if necessary other assets rj bank carries investments in stock of the fhlb and the federal reserve bank of atlanta the frb at cost these investments are held in accordance with certain membership requirements are restricted and lack a market fhlb and frb stock can only be sold to the issuer or another member institution at its par value rj bank annually evaluates its holdings in

goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the related net assets acquired gaap does not provide for the amortization of indefinitelife intangible assets such as goodwill rather these assets are subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired however if the estimated fair value is below carrying value further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment this further analysis involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount in the course of our evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill we may perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary under this elective process we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative analysis is not required however if we conclude otherwise then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis if we either choose not to perform a qualitative assessment or we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred then we perform a quantitative evaluation in the case of a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit which the goodwill that is subject to the quantitative analysis is associated generally defined as the businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compare it to the carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the excess we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date see note 13 for additional information regarding the outcome of our goodwill impairment assessments113indexlegal liabilitieswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated whether a loss is probable and if so the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount within that range if the most likely amount of possible loss within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible we record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables on our consolidated statements of financial condition the determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management management considers many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability balance is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the recorded liability amounts for those matters we expense our cost of defense related to such matters in the period they are incurredsharebased compensationwe account for sharebased awards through the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values the compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards and is calculated as the market value of the awards on the date of the grant see note 24 for additional information in addition we account for sharebased awards to our independent contractor financial advisors in accordance with guidance applicable to accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in conjunction with selling goods or services and guidance applicable to accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a companys own stock sharebased awards granted to our independent contractor financial advisors are measured at their vesting date fair value and their fair value estimated at reporting dates prior to that time the compensation expense recognized each period is based on the most recent estimated value further we classify these nonemployee awards as liabilities at fair value upon vesting with changes in fair value reported in earnings until these awards are exercised or forfeited for purposes of measuring compensation expense these awards are revalued at each reporting date see note 25 for additional information compensation expense is recognized for all sharebased compensation with future service requirements over the requisite service period using the straightline method and in certain instances the graded attribution methoddeferred compensation planswe maintain various deferred compensation plans for the benefit of certain employees and

commences on the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date on which we take possession of the property for tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays we record a deferred rent liability in other liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition and amortize the deferred rent over the lease term as a reduction to rent expense in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income in instances where the office space or equipment under an operating lease will be abandoned prior to the expiration of 114indexthe lease term

determination of the primary beneficiary of each tax credit fund in which rjtcf has a variable interest requires judgment and is based on an analysis of all relevant facts and circumstances including 1 an assessment of the characteristics of rjtcfs variable interest and other involvement it has with the tax credit fund including involvement of related parties and any de facto agents as well as the involvement of other variable interest holders namely limited partners or investor members and 2 the tax credit funds purpose and design including the risks that the tax credit fund was designed to

the fund identifying and acquiring the project partnership investments ongoing asset management fees and a share of any residuals arising from sale of project partnerships upon the termination of the fundthe determination of whether rjtcf is the primary beneficiary of any of the nonguaranteed lihtc funds in which it holds a variable interest is primarily dependent upon 1 the analysis of whether the other variable interest holders in the tax credit fund hold significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the tax credit funds economic performance andor 2

nonguaranteed tax credit funds either nonguaranteed single investor funds or nonguaranteed multiinvestor funds in single investor funds rjtcf has concluded that the one single investor member or limited partner in such funds has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund resulting in a conclusion of shared power with the limited partner therefore rjtcf as managing member or general partner of such funds is not the one party with power over such activities and resultantly is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such single investor funds and these funds are not consolidated in multiinvestor funds rjtcf has concluded that since the participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund are not held by one single investor member or limited partner rjtcf is deemed to have the power over such activities rjtcf then assesses whether its projected benefits to be received from the multiinvestor funds primarily from ongoing asset management fees or its share of any residuals upon the termination of the fund are potentially 116indexsignificant to the fund rjtcf

categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy the sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in significant unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those unobservable inputs are described belowauction rate securitiesone of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of auction rate securities presented within our available for sale securities portfolio relates to judgments regarding whether the level of observable trading activity is sufficient to conclude markets are active where insufficient levels of trading activity are determined to exist as of the reporting date then managements assessment of how much weight to apply to trading prices in inactive markets versus managements own valuation models could significantly impact the valuation conclusion the valuation of the securities impacted by changes in managements assessment of market activity levels could be either higher or lower depending upon the relationship of the inactive trading prices compared to the outcome of managements internal valuation modelsthe future interest rate and maturity assumptions impacting the valuation of the auction rate securities are directly related as shortterm interest rates rise due to the variable nature of the penalty interest rate provisions embedded in most of these securities in the event auctions fail to set the securitys interest rate then a penalty rate that is specified in the security increases these penalty rates are based upon a stated multiple applied to a defined shortterm interest rate index management estimates that at some level of increase in shortterm interest rates issuers of the securities will have the economic incentive to refinance and thus prepay the securities therefore the shortterm interest rate assumption directly impacts the input related to the timing of any projected prepayment the faster and steeper shortterm interest rates rise the earlier prepayments will likely occur and the higher the fair value of the securityprivate equity investmentsthe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of private equity investments relate to the financial performance of the investment entity and the markets required return on investments from entities in industries in which we hold investments significant increases or decreases in our investment entities future economic performance will have a directly proportional impact on the valuation results the value of our investment moves inversely with the markets expectation of returns from such investments should the market require higher returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will decrease in value should the market accept lower returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will increase in valuefair value optionthe fair value option is an accounting election that allows the reporting entity to apply fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis as of september 30 2014 and 2013 we have elected not to choose the fair value option for any of our financial assets or liabilities not already recorded at fair value130indexadditional disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments that are not

instruments including cash and cash equivalents assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value of these instruments these financial instruments generally expose us to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market rates under the fair value hierarchy cash and cash equivalents and assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets are classified as level 1 securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are classified as level 2 under the

2 under the fair value hierarchy bank deposits  the fair values for demand deposits are equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date that is their carrying amounts the carrying amounts of variablerate money market and savings accounts approximate their fair values at the reporting date as these are shortterm in nature due to their demand or shortterm nature the demand deposits and variable rate money market and savings accounts are classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy fair values for fixedrate certificate accounts are estimated using a discounted cash flow

assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow model to project security specific cash flows which factors in the amount of credit enhancement specific to the security the difference between the

for less than 12 months based on the expected cash flows derived from the model utilized in our analysis we expect to recover all unrealized losses not already recorded in earnings on our nonagency cmos however it is possible that the underlying loan collateral of these securities will perform worse than current expectations which may lead to adverse changes in the cash flows expected to be collected on these securities and potential future otti losses as residential mortgage loans are the underlying collateral of these securities the unrealized losses at september 30 2014 reflect the uncertainty in the markets for these instrumentsars the cost basis in the ars we hold is the fair value of the securities in the period in which we acquired them the par value of the ars we hold as of

hold these securities to maturity all of our ars securities are evaluated for otti on a quarterly basiswithin our ars preferred securities we analyze the credit ratings associated with each security as an indicator of potential credit impairment as of september 30 2014 and including subsequent ratings changes all of the ars preferred securities were rated investment grade by at least one rating agency and there is no potential impairment since the fair values of these securities exceed their cost basis within our municipal ars holdings as of september 30 2014 there are two municipal ars securities with a fair value less than their cost basis indicating potential impairment we analyzed the credit ratings associated with these securities as an indicator of potential credit impairment and including subsequent ratings changes determined that these securities maintained investment grade ratings by at least one  rating agency we have the ability and intent to hold these securities to

collateral in a timely mannerspecial mention  loans which have potential weaknesses that deserve managements close attention these loans are not adversely classified and do not expose rj bank to sufficient risk to warrant an adverse classificationsubstandard  loans which are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged if any loans with this classification are characterized by the distinct possibility that rj bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not correcteddoubtful  loans which have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable on the basis of currently known facts conditions and valuesloss  loans which are considered by management to be uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance on rj banks books as an asset without establishment of a specific valuation allowance or chargeoff is not warranted rj bank does not have any loan balances within this classification because in accordance with its accounting policy loans or a portion

adjustment in the prior fiscal year arose from a change in a tax election pertaining to whether assets acquired and liabilities assumed are writtenup to fair value for tax purposes this election is

balance associated with this adjustment to goodwill was the net deferred tax asset2the impairment expense in the prior fiscal year ended september 30 2013 is associated with the rjes reporting unit we concluded the goodwill associated with this reporting unit to be completely impaired during fiscal year 2013 since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the goodwill impairment testing date for the year ended september 30 2013 the effect of this impairment expense on the pretax income attributable to raymond james financial inc is approximately 46 million and the portion of the impairment expense attributable to the noncontrolling interests is approximately 23 million as described in note 2 goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended march 31 2014 evaluating the balances as of december 31 2013 we performed a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of december 31 2013 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of our reporting units as of december 31 2013 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2013 that would cause us to update our latest annual impairment testingin the prior fiscal year we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2012 for this testing we did not choose to exercise the option to perform a qualitative assessment but instead chose to perform a quantitative assessment of the equity value of each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill in our determination of the reporting unit fair value of equity we used a combination of the income approach and the market approach under the income approach we used discounted cash flow models applied to each respective reporting unit under the market approach we calculated an estimated fair value based on a combination of multiples of earnings of guideline companies in the brokerage and capital markets industry that are publicly traded on organized exchanges and the book value of comparable transactions the estimated fair value of the equity of the reporting unit resulting from each of these valuation approaches was dependent upon the estimates of future business unit revenues and costs such estimates were subject to critical assumptions regarding the nature and health of financial markets in future years as well as the discount rate to apply to the projected future cash flows in estimating future cash flows a balance sheet as of the test date and a statement of operations for the last twelve months of activity for each reporting unit or for the nine month period since the closing date for morgan keegan reporting units were compiled future balance sheets and statements of operations were then projected and estimated future cash flows were determined by the combination of these projections the 151indexcash flows were discounted at the reporting units estimated cost of equity which was derived through application of the capital asset pricing model the valuation result from the market approach was dependent upon the selection of the comparable guideline companies and transactions and the earnings multiple applied to each respective reporting units projected earnings finally significant management judgment was applied in determining the weight assigned to the outcome of the market approach and the income approach which resulted in one single estimate of the fair value of the equity of the reporting unitthe following summarizes certain key assumptions utilized in our quantitative analysis performed in the prior fiscal year      key

changes including but not limited to a decline in overall market conditions adverse business trends and changes in regulations based upon the outcome of our prior year quantitative assessments we concluded that the goodwill associated with rjes a joint venture based in paris france that we hold a controlling interest in was completely impaired the impairment expense recorded in the year ended september 30 2013 of 69 million is included in other expense on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the annual testing date our share of this impairment expense after consideration of the noncontrolling interests amounts to 46 million rjes is an entity that provides research coverage on european corporations as well as having sales and trading operations the decline in value of rjes as of december 31 2012 was primarily due to the economic slowdown experienced in europe which was having a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein at such time as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended march 31 2013 which impacted rjes operating plans on a going forward basis in april 2013 we purchased all of the outstanding equity in rjes that was held by others thus we now have sole control over rjes there was no goodwill impairment in any other reporting unit in fiscal

collateral balances related thereto we also act as an intermediary between brokerdealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one brokerdealer and then lend them to another securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash collateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions we measure the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis the market value of securities borrowed was 1133 million and securities loaned was 61 million at september 30 2014 and the market value of securities borrowed was 646 million and securities loaned was 427 million at september 30 2013 the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 1177 million and 673 million respectively at september 30 2014 and the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 664 million and 495 million respectively at september 30 2013 additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized if another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed for example failure to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transactionwe have also loaned to brokerdealers and other financial institutions securities owned by clients and others for which we have received cash or other collateral the market value of securities loaned was 3412 million and 2991 million at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively the contract value of securities loaned was 350 million and 3051 million at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively if a borrowing institution or brokerdealer does not return a security we may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return it to the owner in such circumstances we may incur a loss equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial institution or the brokerdealer we have sold securities that we do not currently own and will therefore be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date we have recorded 2384 million and 2207 million at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively which represents the market value of such securities see notes 5 and 6 for further information we are subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal yearend we utilize short positions on government obligations and equity securities to economically hedge long proprietary inventory positionswe enter into security transactions on behalf of our clients and other brokers involving forward settlement forward contracts provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument the contractual amounts related to these financial instruments reflect the volume and activity and do not reflect the amounts at risk the gain or loss on these transactions is recognized on a trade date basis transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument our exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors including the duration size composition and diversification of positions held the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and market volatility the credit risk for these transactions is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains recorded in the consolidated statements of financial conditionthe majority of our transactions and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure is with clients brokerdealers and other financial institutions in the us these activities primarily involve collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations we seek to control our credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties financial condition and credit ratings we monitor collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and request changes in collateral levels as appropriate 181indexrj ltd is subject to foreign exchange risk primarily due to financial instruments denominated in us dollars that may be impacted by fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in order to mitigate this risk rj ltd enters into forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of these contracts is not significant as of september 30 2014 forward contracts outstanding to buy and sell us dollars totaled cdn 17 million and cdn 409 million respectively rj bank is also subject to foreign exchange risk related to its net investment in a canadian subsidiary see note 18 for information regarding how rj bank utilizes net investment hedges to mitigate a significant portion of this riskrj bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases which then extend over varying periods of time these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments and each customers credit worthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis fixedrate commitments if any are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and rj banks exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments rj banks commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments outstanding are as follows as of september 30 2014 2013 in thousandsstandby letters of credit100582 122672open end consumer lines of credit1585717 829923commercial lines of credit1692896 1743594unfunded loan commitments248931 216918in the normal course of business rj bank issues or participates in the issuance of financial standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary these standby letters of credit generally expire in one year or less as of september 30 2014 101 million of such letters of credit were outstanding in the event that a letter of credit is drawn down rj bank would pursue repayment from the party under the existing borrowing relationship or would liquidate collateral or both the proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to clients and accordingly rj bank uses a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitmentsopen end consumer lines of credit primarily represent the unfunded amounts of rj bank loans to customers that are secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of creditbecause many of rj banks lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or part the contract amounts are not estimates of rj banks actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements rj bank maintains a reserve to provide for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments see note 9 for further discussion of this reserve for unfunded lending commitmentscredit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that the collateral or other security is of no value rj bank uses the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments and other creditrelated offbalance sheet instruments as it does in making loansas a part of our fixed income public finance operations rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase gnma or fnma mbs see note 2 and note 21 for information on these commitments we utilize tba security contracts to hedge our interest rate risk associated with these commitments we are subject to loss if the timing of or the actual amount of the mbs securities differs significantly from the term and notional amount of the tba security contracts we enter into 182indexnote 28  earnings per sharethe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share year ended
