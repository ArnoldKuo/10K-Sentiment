brokerdealer subsidiariesto the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions a change in applicable statutes regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our businessthe financial services industry in the us is subject to extensive regulation under federal and state laws new rules and regulations resulting from the doddfrank act in july 2010 the u s government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform amp consumer protection act doddfrank act the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately however the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies furthermore many provisions of the doddfrank act are still subject to further rule making procedures and studies and will take effect over several years the doddfrank act instructs us federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings studies and reports these regulatory agencies include the commodity futures trading commission the sec the fed the occ the fdic the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council the fsoc as 10indexa result of doddfrank act rulemaking and other regulatory reforms we are currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in regulation and these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct certain aspects of our business given the current status of the regulatory developments we cannot currently quantify the possible effects on our business and operations of all of the significant changes that are currently underway see item 1a risk factors within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations certain of the changes enacted under the doddfrank act thus far include the followingsince rj bank provides deposits covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is subject to the federal deposit insurance act in february 2011 under the provisions of the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments for banks with more than 10 billion in assets the fdics new rule changed the assessment rate calculation which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the fdics exposure should the bank fail this new rule became effective for rj bank beginning with the december 2013 assessment period in july 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act the cfpb began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has supervisory and enforcement powers under such laws as the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act real estate settlement procedures act fair credit reporting act fair debt collection act the consumer financial privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and certain other statutes at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 the cfpb assumed regulatory authority over rj bank for its compliance with various federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment the majority of those became effective in early fiscal year 2014 the cfpb has authority to promulgate regulations and issue orders policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions the creation of the cfpb has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination remediation efforts and possible penaltiesin october 2012 under the provisions of the doddfrank act regulators issued final rules requiring banking organizations with total assets of more than 10 billion but less than 50 billion to conduct annual companyprepared stress tests report the results to their primary regulator and the fed and publish a summary of the results under the rules stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios baseline adverse and severely adverse which the fed

banks and their affiliates the regulated entities the socalled volcker rule in december 2013 the cftc the occ the fed the fdic and the sec adopted a final version of the volcker rule we continue to review the details contained in the final volcker rule to assess its impact on our operations based upon our latest analysis and understandings of these regulations we do not anticipate that it will have a material impact on our results of operations  the final volcker rule prohibits regulated entities from engaging in proprietary trading and imposes limitations on the extent to which regulated entities are permitted to invest in certain covered funds ie hedge funds and private equity funds and requires that such investments be fully deducted from tier 1 capital it limits a regulated entitys aggregate ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds to three percent of tier i capital although the impact of such limit to rjfs investment portfolio is subject to further analysis additionally regulated entities are prohibited from owning three percent or more of any single fund congress provided an exemption for certain permitted activities of regulated entities such as underwriting market making hedging and risk managementthe final volcker rules became effective as of april 1 2014 and conformance is required by july 21 2015 however the conformance period may be subject to two additional oneyear extensions by the fed furthermore regulated entities can apply for an additional fiveyear extension for certain qualifying investments we currently maintain

investments of this nature that we may make may be 11indexlimited in order to maintain compliance levels specified by the regulation further subsequent interpretations of what constitutes covered funds under the final volcker rule may adversely impact our operations in july 2013 the occ the frb and the fdic released final united states basel iii regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establishes a capital conservation buffer and makes selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the rule becomes effective for us on january 1 2015 subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both rjf and rj bank however based on our current analyses we believe that rjf and rj bank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules however the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this report for more informationin july 2014 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds the amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdraws over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds while preserving the benefits of the funds we do not sponsor any money market funds we utilize such funds to a small extent for our own investment purposes and offer to our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternativeseffective july 1 2014 certain final rules issued by the sec regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors became effective these rules specify which activities will be covered by the doddfrank act imposed fiduciary duty of a municipal advisor to its government client may result in the need for new written representations by issuers and may limit the manner in which we in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles interact with municipal issuers we registered as a municipal advisor and by virtue of such registration are now subject to additional regulation and oversight in respect of our municipal finance business the sec recently announced that it will undertake a twoyear review of municipal advisors additionally forthcoming rulemaking by the municipal securities rulemaking board may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local government are able to interact with the outside finance professionals although these new rules impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients and may have a negative shortterm impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry adapts to the new rules we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations which are included in our capital markets segment other regulations

october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries however based on our current analyses we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our brokerdealer subsidiaries pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to brokerdealers financial

liquidity and the trading price of our common stock or our senior notes which are listed on the nyserisks related to our business and industrydamage to our reputation could damage our businessesmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients customers investors and associates if we fail to deal with or appear to fail to deal with issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues moneylaundering privacy record keeping sales and trading practices failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in our products a failure to maintain appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to our reputation further negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may also harm our future business prospects we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including levels of economic output interest and inflation rates employment levels consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy these conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits 15indexat times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low levels of economic output artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high rates of unemployment and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad these conditions led to several factors in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while select factors indicate signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting financial advisory and other services increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses these periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited  us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the middle east and in eastern europe and russia concerns about the european unions eu sovereign debt in recent years has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the eus financial support programs and the possibility exists that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these matters could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity  our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states foreign governments and domestic and international agencies the fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict we may also be indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy enacted in various global marketsus state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america united states andor canadian factors which are indicative of market conditions include interest rates the rate of unemployment real estate prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earningslack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionmaintaining an appropriate level of liquidity or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment spending or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for our company and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions the availability of outside financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on a variety of factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost and availability of funding may be adversely 16indexaffected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of any future concerns about the stability of the markets generally and the strength of counterparties specificallyif rjfs credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our relationships with clients such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our incremental borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in one of our credit agreements and certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information as of september 30 2014 furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent for the subsidiaries they supervise see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity riskwe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitability market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and merchant banking investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuerin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidityour venture capital and merchant banking investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market risk17indexwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets do not meet their performance obligations due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reasons we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers market making and underwriting businesses exposing us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities loans and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses  we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase and agreements to resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits and by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged in the case of aged securities failed to receive we may under industry regulations purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty also we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity could result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals including but not limited to campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit and margin and nonpurpose loans collateralized by securities we incur credit risk through our investments which include mbs collateralized mortgage obligations auction rate securities and other municipal securitiesour credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to a natural disaster act of terrorism severe weather event or economic event could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit riskour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and on advisory feesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly 18indexaffect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management assets under management balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impacting our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting market making trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold primarily in connection with our market making or underwriting activitiesfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded there is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients furthermore although we do not hold any eu sovereign debt we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the eu sovereign debt circumstances defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us although we have not suffered any material or significant losses as a result of the failure of any financial counterparty any such losses in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations19indexwe have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilityour business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginsregions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan mattersunder the definitive stock purchase agreement dated january 11 2012 entered into by rjf and regions governing our acquisition of morgan keegan the spa regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify rjf with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters rjf is relying on regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the spa with respect to such matters our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified could result in our incurring significant costs for defense settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and our regulatory capital levelssee note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding these indemnification agreementsgrowth of our business could increase costs and regulatory and integration risksintegrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments if and to the extent they arise from time to time our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growthexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction moreover to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business such acquisitions could be of significant size andor complexity this effort together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings or perhaps at all we face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms hedge funds and others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services in addition the continued development of internet networking or telecommunication technologies or other technological changes 20indexcould require us to incur substantial expenditures to enhance or adapt our services or infrastructure an inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilityour ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals particularly our managing directors and the members of our executive committees as well as employees and financial advisors to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel the reputations and relationships of our senior professionals with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagement competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidityturnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a new or existing competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenuesmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may currently be working for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining uswe are exposed to operational riskour diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems external events including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center operations processing sites or our branches our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses our financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services operational risk exists in every activity function or unit of our business and can take the form of internal or external fraud employment and hiring practices an error in meeting a professional obligation or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our employees engage in misconduct our businesses would be adversely affected operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption system failures or failed transaction processing third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties in addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors including outsourced operationsour business contingency plan in place is intended to ensure we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets including staff and technology in the event of a business interruption despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans due to unforeseen factors our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access catastrophic events including weather related events events involving 21indexelectrical environmental or communications malfunctions as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct businesssee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk associate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harmthere have been a number of highlypublicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry and there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients if our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected our businesses depend on technologyour businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standardsour continued success depends in part upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our systems our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and our ability to retain skilled information technology employees failure of our systems which could result from events beyond our control or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other laws and regulatory sanctions client and customer public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased thus our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise todate we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future notwithstanding that we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact if one or more of these events occur this could jeopardize our or our clients or counterparties confidential and other information processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our our clients our counterparties or third parties operations we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured or are not fully covered through any insurance we maintain a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulatorsextraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes in volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail while we have made investments to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances systems failures and delays could occur and could cause among other things unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire resulting in client dissatisfaction22indexin providing services to clients we may manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as the us federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through systems failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and their related revenue in the future potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant and depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit of liability or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damagessee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing these types of operational riskour operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditionscertain of our principal operations are located in st petersburg florida while we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted from our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee locations and our information systems processing is conducted out of our new information technology data center in the denver colorado

events including weather events could adversely impact rj banks loan portfolio and the we are exposed to operational risk risk factor in this item 1a for a discussion of how weather related events could impact our ability to conduct businesswe are exposed to litigation risksmany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability arising in the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability for us advisors may not understand investor needs or risk tolerances such failures may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor to the extent we fail to know our clients or improperly advise them we could be found liable for losses suffered by such clients which could harm our business our private client group business segment has historically had more risk of litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients investment objectives the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial effect or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and our prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operationsas it pertains to morgan keegan a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition are subject to indemnification from regions refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan matters for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnificationssee item 3 legal proceedings in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for discussion regarding our approach to managing legal risk23indexthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may influence the complexity and increase the uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective being based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment and could lead to declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations from time to time the financial accounting standards board fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for a further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 in this report and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10kin december 2012 the fasb issued a proposed standard on accounting for credit losses the standard would replace multiple existing impairment models including replacing an incurred loss model for loans with an expected loss model the fasb announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard we cannot predict whether or when a final standard will be issued when it will be effective what its final provisions will be or the potential impact its eventual adoption may have on our retained earnings our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we employ limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes further our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to adequately manage our growth or to effectively manage our risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business we have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through more numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the failure to adequately address or the perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect our reputation 24indexthe willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this reportwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions of the world commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to a number of risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks in nonus markets our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations andor our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the above factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because generally nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are smaller less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets additionally a political economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generallywe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion of employeerelated health care benefits plans we fund among others while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our businessrisks related to our regulatory environmentfinancial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actionsfirms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment which we expect will become even more stringent in light of recent wellpublicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators including the sec the nyse finra the occ the cfpb the fed and state attorneys general penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services including but not limited to the authority to fine us and to grant cancel restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to carry on particular businesses for example a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the exchange act on brokerdealers and the investment advisers act on investment advisers including recordkeeping advertising and operating requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities or by the investment company act of 1940 could result in investigations sanctions and reputational damage we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or finra or other selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have adverse financial effects on us or cause reputational harm to us which could harm our business prospectschanges in regulations resulting from either the doddfrank act or any new regulations may affect our businessesthe market and economic conditions over the past several years have led to legislation and numerous and continuing proposals for changes in the regulation of the financial services industry including significant additional legislation and regulation in the 25indexus and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry see item 1 regulation in this report for a discussion of such changes including the volcker rule the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act will have on us the financial industry and the economy cannot be known until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and implemented these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of assets that we hold require us to change certain of our business practices impose additional costs on us or otherwise adversely affect our businessesthe doddfrank act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which while not currently anticipated to could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our business include but are not limited to the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds outlined in the doddfrank act these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has been active in investigating products services and operations of credit providers including banks for compliance with various laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act and the real estate settlement procedures act any actions taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make them less attractive restrict our ability to offer them or increase our regulatory and compliance costs to the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with usin december 2013 the final version of the volcker rule was adopted see item 1 regulation in this report for discussion of the volcker rule although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of trading for our own account due to our underwriting and market making activities the volcker rule will likely increase our operational and compliance costs and may reduce our trading revenues require a change in our principal capital private equity investments and as a result adversely affect our results of operationsthe sec recently adopted amendments most of which were effective october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries such impact could have an adverse effect on certain of our brokerdealer subsidiariesthe basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitabilityin july 2013 the occ the frb and the fdic released final us basel iii regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required

the rule becomes effective for us january 1 2015 subject to a transition period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions we are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on both rj bank and rjf the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affectedfailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action rjf and rj bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices rjfs and rj banks capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of our capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital to riskweighted assets and tier i capital to adjusted assets as defined in the regulations failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and our financial condition26indexas more fully discussed in item 1 regulation in this report rjf is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the fed while we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capitaladditionally as rjf is a holding company it depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including among others debt service we are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and the net capital rule of finra which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements in addition our canada based brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligationssee note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on regulations and capital requirementswe operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionthe securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including but not limited to sales and trading methods trade practices among brokerdealers use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts record keeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees if laws or regulations are violated we could be subject to one or more of the following civil liability criminal liability sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operationswe are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements including the maintenance of certain riskbased regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses however due to our strong current capital position we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities see the section entitled business  regulation of item 1 in this report for additional informationas a financial holding company we are regulated by the fed rj bank is regulated by the occ the fed the cfpb and the fdic this oversight includes but is not limited to scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by our regulators could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations the sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the investment company act of 1940 with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares the staff of the office of compliance inspections and examinations has indicated that it is reviewing use of fund assets to pay for fees to subtransfer agents and subadministrators for services that may be deemed to be distributionrelated any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry the impact of changes such as those currently proposed cannot be predicted at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds investment advisors and brokerdealers some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as an investment advisor with the sec and the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities it is impossible 27indexto determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to brokerdealers however any such standard if mandated would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and result in changes to these and require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliancein addition in recent years the us and other governments have taken actions and may continue to take further actions including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries and in particular our investment management business for example several states and municipalities in the united states have recently adopted paytoplay rules which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees and could therefore affect the profitability of that portion of our business in addition the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors is periodically reexamined and may in the future be limited or modified although a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts external research including external research paid for with soft dollars is important to the process this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as third party provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars is limited we may have to bear some of these costs furthermore new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs for example many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund businesses or other businesses and changes to the laws rules and regulations in the us related to the overthecounter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration recordkeeping and reporting obligationssee the section entitled business  regulation within item 1 in this report for additional information
