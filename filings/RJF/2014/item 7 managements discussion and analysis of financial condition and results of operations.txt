the following managements discussion and analysis mdampa is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition the mdampa is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2014 compared with the year ended september 30 2013 for the fifth consecutive year we achieved record net revenues of 49 billion a 376 million or 8 increase compared to the prior year the increase generated by our ongoing operations is even greater than that amount after factoring in the 74 million of revenue reflected in the prior year that was associated with a private equity investment we sold last year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues the fifth straight year for our private client group and capital markets segments total client assets under administration increased to 475 billion at september 30 2014 a 12 increase over the prior year level we also achieved a record level of net income to 480 million an increase of 113 million or 31 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 332 increased 074 or 29 over the prior year amount after excluding the acquisition related and other onetime expenses we incurred in the prior year our adjusted net income increased 61 million or 15 compared to the prior year period a nongaap measure1 the increase in net income over the prior year level is even more significant given that the prior year net income included 14 million after the attribution to noncontrolling interests arising from our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion a private equity holding which was sold during the prior yearnoninterest expenses increased 254 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses which were partially offset by the decrease in acquisition related expenses acquisition and integration related expenses in fiscal year 2014 are no longer material for separate reporting since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the combination of increasing net revenues and overall expense control in fiscal year 2014 helped us achieve a 154 pretax margin on net revenuesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 33 billion a 12 increase while pretax income increased 100 million or 43 to a record 330 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in corresponding commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased by only 1 client assets under administration of the private client group increased 12 over the prior year level to 4506 billion at september 30 2014 net inflows of client assets have been positively impacted by successful recruiting of financial advisors among other favorable factors1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa33indexthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 966 million a 3 increase while pretax income increased 28 million or 28 to a record 131 million increases in trading profits merger and acquisition fee revenues equity underwriting fee revenues and institutional sales commissions on equity products more than offset a decline in institutional sales commissions on fixed income products the decline in institutional fixed income commission revenues results from challenging fixed income market conditions during the fiscal year due to economic uncertainty historically low interest rates relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and decreased customer trading volumes our asset management segment generated record net revenues of 370 million a 26 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 33 to a record 128 million financial assets under management increased 15 from the prior year to 646 billion as of september 30 2014 both strong net inflows of client assets and market appreciation contributed to the increase we also earned nearly 10 million in performance fees in the current year compared to nearly 2 million in the prior year as a result of positive net performance from certain of our managed funds a portion of which are attributable to noncontrolling interests which contributed to the increase in revenues and pretax income rj bank generated record net revenues of 352 million a 1 increase while pretax income decreased 25 million or 9 to 243 million net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding offset in large part by a lower net interest margin the provision for loan losses increased primarily as the result of significant loan portfolio growth partially offset by decreases resulting from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio reflecting the positive impact from improved economic conditions noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses increased 19 millionactivities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that is 48 million less than the prior year our noninterest expenses decreased substantially as we are no longer incurring acquisition and integration related costs since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 in addition the prior year included significant revenues and pretax income associated with our indirect investment in albion which was sold in april 2013 thus having a significant impact on comparisons to the prior year our fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate is 358 up from the 349 in fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings both years included significant nontaxable gains in the value of our companyowned life insurance portfoliothe regulatory environment in which we operate our businesses continues to produce changes that result from new rules and additional regulations that could impact our businesses in the future that being the case our current view of the potential impact to us of future regulations remains substantially unchanged by the regulatory activities that occurred during the year based on our continuing review of the doddfrank act and because of the nature of our businesses and our business practices we presently do not expect the legislation to have a significant direct impact on our operations as a whole however because some of the implementing regulations either have yet to be adopted have yet to become effective or are under further analysis by various regulatory agencies the specific impact on some of our businesses remains uncertain 34indexyear ended september 30 2013 compared with the year ended september 30 2012we achieved record net revenues of 45 billion in fiscal year 2013 a 679 million or 18 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record net revenues and pretax earnings revenues were higher in fiscal year 2013 in part because the results include twelve months of morgan keegan operations as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012 in addition fiscal year 2013 net revenues include a 65 million gain on a proprietary capital investment a 227 million impact to rjf net revenues after noncontrolling interests which further elevated our revenues our pretax income increased 93 million in fiscal year 2013 or 20 compared to the prior year to 564 million excluding the acquisition related expenses primarily resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition in fiscal year 2013 we generated adjusted pretax income of 644 million a nongaap measure1 a 21 increase over the prior year earnings per share in fiscal year 2013 increased 17 over the prior year to 258 per share excluding the acquisition related expenses mentioned above fiscal year 2013 adjusted earnings per share a nongaap measure1 increased 18 to 295 per share all of our operating segments performed well during fiscal year 2013 as each achieved record levels of pretax income total client assets under administration were a record 4254 billion at september 30 2013 a 10 increase over the prior year level noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 553 million or 17 primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of expenses from legacy morgan keegan businesses increases in compensation related expenses information technology expenses and acquisition related expenses were partially offset by a decrease in the bank loan loss provisionsignificant milestones achieved in fiscal year 2013 include the midfebruary 2013 transfer of all of the morgan keegan financial advisors and client accounts from the morgan keegan platform to the rjampa platform following that conversion and allowing time for the former morgan keegan financial advisors to become proficient in the use of the rjampa platform in the june 2013 quarter we implemented staff reductions these reductions occurred mainly within our information technology groups where there was significant overlap in historic morgan keegan and rjampa support staffing that we had elected to maintain through the platform conversion date in order to ensure the continued high levels of service to financial advisors and clients while we operated on two different platforms retention levels remain very high for the legacy morgan keegan financial advisors the morgan keegan capital markets businesses were also integrated primarily fixed income and public finance investment banking during fiscal year 2013 and further staff reductions were made given these accomplishments as of september 30 2013 our various morgan keegan integration initiatives have been substantially and successfully completeda summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal year 2013 compared to the prior year in addition to the impact of twelve months of morgan keegan operations in fiscal year 2013 compared to six months in the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 29 billion in fiscal year 2013 an 18 increase while pretax income increased 7 to 230 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts pretax income in fiscal year 2013 was negatively impacted by an increase in commission expenses driven primarily by the increase in corresponding commission revenues as well as an increase in communication and information processing expense client assets under administration of the private client group increased 9 over the prior year to 4026 billion at september 30 2013 the capital markets segment generated net revenues of 938 million in fiscal year 2013 a 15 increase while pretax income increased 35 to 102 million we experienced significant increases in institutional fixed income commission revenues merger and acquisition fees and fixed income investment banking revenues equity capital markets commission levels increased as a result of improved equity market conditions results from our equity capital markets investment banking business were uneven throughout fiscal year 2013 characterized by intermittent periods of significant activity and ending the year with strong results our fixed income operations improved overall but were negatively impacted during times of adverse fixed income market conditions these adverse conditions resulted from medium and longer term interest rate volatility which negatively impacted our trading results our asset management segment generated revenues of 293 million in fiscal year 2013 a 23 increase while pretax income increased 43 to 96 million assets under management in managed programs increased 31 to a record 56 billion as of september 30 2013 strong net inflows of client assets in managed programs including from legacy mk amp co branches market appreciation and our acquisition of an interest in clarivest contributed to the increase 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa35indexrj bank generated 268 million in pretax income in fiscal year 2013 an 11 increase over the prior year the increase resulted primarily from the significant decrease in the loan loss provision expense and an increase in net interest income the decrease in the loan loss provision expense resulted from an improved credit environment the favorable resolution of certain problem loans and a significant reduction in residential mortgage delinquent loans the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of an increase in average loans outstanding in our nonoperating other segment our fiscal year 2013 results reflect a 6 million increase in our pretax loss this segment includes certain corporate expenses our principal capital and our private equity activities our results were favorably impacted by the sale of our indirect investment in albion in april 2013 the albion investment generated an increase of 18 million in pretax income net of noncontrolling interests we also experienced other less significant increases on other investments in our private equity portfolio those increases were more than offset by additional acquisition and integration related costs incurred from the morgan keegan acquisition and a full years interest expense associated with debt financings executed in march 2012 to finance a portion of the acquisitionour earnings benefited from a favorable effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2013 decreased to 349 from 373 in fiscal year 2012 the tax rate decrease primarily resulted from a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain foreign earnings as well as a significant increase in nontaxable income associated with the change in market value of companyowned life insurance36indexsegmentsthe following table presents our consolidated and segment gross revenues net revenues and pretax income loss the latter excluding noncontrolling interests for the years

are no nongaap adjustments in the year ended september 30 2014 as we no longer separately report acquisition and integration related costs since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially

footnotes 7 and 8 above for the calculation of average equitynongaap basis38indexnet interest analysiswe have certain assets and liabilities not only held in our rj bank segment but also held in our pcg capital markets and other segments which are subject to changes in interest rates these changes in interest rates have an impact on our overall financial performance given the relationship of our interest sensitive assets to liabilities held in each of these segments an increase in shortterm interest rates would result in an overall increase in our net earnings we currently have more assets than liabilities with a yield that would be affected by a change in shortterm interest rates a gradual increase in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this report which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankbased upon our latest analysis performed as of september 30 2014 we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates would result in an increase in our pretax income of approximately 150 million over a twelve month period approximately half of such an increase would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2014 and a conservative assumption related to interest credited to our clients on their cash balances in such an interest rate environment the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the vast majority of any incremental benefit to pretax income from a rise in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume that a significant portion of any further incremental increase in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of similar amounts in our interest expense 39indexthe following table presents our consolidated average interestearning asset and liability balances interest income and expense balances and the average yieldcost for the

million pcgs pretax margin on net revenues increased to 101 as compared to 79 in fiscal year 2013 securities commissions and fees increased 303 million or 12 the increase results predominately from growth in client assets under administration the year over year increase in client assets was driven by the equity market conditions in the us which were generally improved as compared to the prior year and increased financial advisor productivity the most significant increases in these revenues arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 245 million or 24 and commission revenues on mutual fund products which increased 57 million or 9 primarily due to increases in trailing commissions on mutual fund products partially offset by a 21 million or 21 decrease in commissions on fixed income products commission earnings on fixed income products decreased primarily due to historically low interest rates and a general lack of volatility of benchmark interest rates securities commissions and fee revenues generated by our canadian operations increased 5 over the prior year total account and service fee revenues increased 44 million or 13 over the prior year mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 44 million or 26 primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund omnibus fees and education and marketing support ems fees which include notransactionfee ntf program revenues all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute we continue to implement changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements in addition effective with our midfebruary 2013 platform integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs resulting in an increase in this fee revenuepcg net interest increased 4 million or 5 primarily resulting from an increase in margin interest rates despite a slight decrease in average margin balances growth in margin loans in fiscal year 2014 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our securities based lending product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2014 and the related low net interest spreads earned there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash balances refer to the discussion of how the pretax income of this segment could be favorably impacted by a 100 basis

a full year of mk amp co private client group operations are included in the fiscal year 2013 results as compared to six months in fiscal year 2012 therefore comparisons of our legacy private client group operations to our fiscal year 2013 operations are not meaningful as of midfebruary 2013 all of the mk amp co financial advisors and client accounts from the mk amp co platform were transferred to and integrated with the rjampa platformsecurities commissions and fees in fiscal year 2013 increased 399 million or 19 a significant portion of this increase resulted from our acquisition of morgan keegan on april 2 2012 which brought over 900 financial advisors into pcg 863 of whom were retained through the february 2013 integration of the morgan keegan operations into those of rjampa securities commissions and fee revenues generated by our canadian operations increased 6 over the prior year despite a small decrease in the total number of pcg financial advisors at september 30 2013 compared to september 30 2012 the average productivity per financial advisor for the same comparable period has increased 9 client assets under administration of 4026 billion in the pcg segment increased 349 billion or 9 as compared to september 30 2012 primarily resulting from equity market appreciation in the usclient account and service fee revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased 13 million or 9 over the prior year the increase primarily results from an increase in the fees we receive in lieu of interest earnings from our multibank sweep program balances in this program increased primarily as a result of the transfer of mk amp co client accounts to the raymond james program additional mk amp co client accounts also resulted in an increase in service fee income which increased as a result of the additional client account volume in addition we realized an increase in fees resulting from assets invested in alternative investment fundsmutual fund and annuity service fees in fiscal year 2013 increased 32 million or 23 primarily as a result of an increase in mutual fund omnibus fees ems fees and ntf program revenues all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute in addition to an increase in the mutual fund assets on which these fees are generally paid during fiscal year 2013 we implemented changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements the offsetting increased costs we have incurred to third parties to provide the additional information is included in communications and information processing expenses discussed below effective with our midfebruary 2013 platform integration the former morgan keegan client mutual fund investments became eligible for our omnibus and ems programs further increasing this revenuepartially offsetting the increases in revenues described in the preceding two paragraphs client transaction fees in fiscal year 2013 decreased 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of certain mutual fund relationships converting during fiscal year 2013 to a ntf program and an april 2012 reduction in transaction fees associated with certain nondiscretionary assetbased programs under the mutual fund ntf program we receive increased fees from mutual fund companies which are included within mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue described above but our clients no longer pay us transaction fees on mutual fund trades within certain of our managed programs other revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased by 5 million or 21 primarily as a result of spreads earned on crosscurrency transactions within our canadian operations total segment revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased 18 the portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 68 at september 30 2013 as contrasted to the september 30 2012 level of 64 recurring commission and fee revenues include assetbased fees trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuitiesinsurance products mutual fund service fees fees earned on funds in our multibank sweep program and interest assets in feebased accounts as of september 30 2013 were 1399 billion a majority of which is included in our asset management programs an increase of 21 as compared to the 1157 billion of assets in feebased accounts at september 30 2012the amount of net interest in the pcg segment in fiscal year 2013 was nearly unchanged from the prior year level increases in client margin balances and client cash balances outstanding over the year were nearly completely offset by further decreases 44indexin interest rates as a result of the extremely low rate interest environment that existed during fiscal year 2013 there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from the client cash balance increase as the interest spread earned on client balances were at historically low levels noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 430 million or 19 over the prior year sales commission expense increased 275 million or 18 consistent with the 19 increase in commission and fee revenues administrative and incentive compensation expenses increased 61 million or 14 this increase resulted primarily from the impact of a full year of salaries and benefits expense associated with the increased support staff and information technology and operations headcount arising from the addition of the morgan keegan associates communications and information processing expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 49 million or 43 computer software development costs and other information technology related costs which include consulting expenses increased over 42 million as compared to the prior year as a result of various information technology enhancements to existing platforms costs associated with operating two platforms for a portion of the year additional reporting requirements including regulatory requirements and expenses associated with omnibus arrangements refer to the increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenue arising from these arrangements discussed above occupancy and equipment expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 18 million or 19 primarily due to a full years rent and other facility related expenses associated with the increase of approximately 140 branch office locations resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition clearance and other expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 27 million or 38 these expense increases can generally be attributed to clearing and floor brokerage expenses resulting from the additional volume of client accounts and transactions arising from the morgan keegan acquisition

resulting from both favorable equity markets throughout the year and an active new issue market environment at certain times during fiscal year 2014 the active new issue market resulted in a 14 increase in equity underwriting fee revenues to 100 million underwriting fee revenues increased in both our domestic as well as our canadian equity capital markets operations the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 were real estate financial services and energyinstitutional fixed income sales commissions decreased 81 million or 25 primarily due to the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2014 resulting from economic uncertainty the continuation of historically low interest rates periods of relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and the resulting decreased customer trading volumes despite such conditions trading results were solid and steady during the year resulting in a 32 million or 112 improvement over the 46indexprior year which included a quarter the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 which was particularly negative these trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities these favorable trading results in fiscal year 2014 were achieved even as we continued to maintain relatively lower average balances of trading securities in response to the market uncertainty refer to the table of average interest earning asset and liability balances in the net interest section of this mdampa for information on our average levels of trading instruments held during each respective year merger and acquisitions and advisory fee revenues increased 24 million or 19 compared to the prior year the current year includes increases in revenues in both our domestic and canadian operations the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of such fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 were technology services healthcare energy financial services technology and general industrialstax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased by 10 million or 40 due to a 16 increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year and current year recognition of certain revenues that were associated with partnership interests sold in prior years which had been deferred in those years current year recognition of these previously deferred revenues result from the favorable resolution of certain conditions associated with the partnership interests which once favorably resolved result in the recognition of previously deferred revenuesnoninterest expenses increased 10 million or 1 compared to the prior year administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 25 million or 6 compared to the prior year offset by a decrease in sales commission expense of 30 million or 13 which is directly correlated with the 12 decrease in overall institutional sales commission revenues incentive compensation expense increases are primarily the result of higher volumes of underwriting mergers amp acquisitions and advisory fees investment banking and tax credit fund syndication fee revenues as well as to a lesser extent annual salary increases applicable to all of our operations the prior year included goodwill impairment expense of 7 million related to our rjes operations which did not recur in the current year losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds and

therefore included in the offsetting noncontrolling interests refer to note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on the consolidation of vies  noncontrolling interests includes the impact of consolidating certain lowincome housing tax credit funds which impacts other revenue interest expense and the losses of real estate partnerships held by

portion of these consolidated entities which we do not own total segment expenses attributable to others increased by 10 million compared to the prior year the increase in expenses associated with noncontrolling interests resulting from losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies discussed above are offset by the impact of the prior year consolidation of rjes as a result of our

2013 compared with the year ended september 30 2012  capital marketspretax income in fiscal year 2013 in the capital markets segment increased 26 million or 35 over the prior year certain of the capital markets businesses of morgan keegan were immediately integrated into rjampas operations on the date of acquisition other morgan keegan capital markets businesses were integrated into rjampa over time and were completed by midfebruary 2013 a full year of morgan keegan equity capital markets and fixed income operations are included in fiscal year 2013 results as compared to only six months in fiscal year 2012 impacting comparisons of our legacy capital markets results especially fixed income operations to fiscal year 2013 resultsour fixed income revenues in fiscal year 2013 were significantly higher as compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of a full years morgan keegan results the combination of our former fixed income operations with morgan keegans fixed income operations results in a combined department that is approximately three times the size of our legacy fixed income business net revenues in fiscal year 2013 increased by 126 million or 15 total institutional sales commissions increased 15 over the prior year equity institutional sales commissions increased 17 million or 7 primarily due to improved equity market conditions the 60 million or 22 increase in fixed income institutional sales commissions over the prior year is primarily due to the increased size of our fixed income operations after the morgan keegan acquisition and the inclusion of twelve months of 47indexthe combined entities operations in the current year as compared to only six months in the prior year our significantly larger public finance fixed income operations as a result of the morgan keegan acquisition favorably impacted both our investment banking revenues and our securities commissions and fees the number of lead and comanaged equity underwritings as well as merger amp acquisition transactions during fiscal year 2013 increased significantly in our us operations as compared to the prior year in the latter part of the first quarter of our fiscal 2013 concerns related to the then pending fiscal cliff crisis had at least in part a favorable impact on our equity capital markets business as underwriting and merger and acquisition activity improved significantly as issuers sought to complete certain equity transactions in advance of any anticipated tax law changes the activity levels experienced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 slowed considerably thereafter until a very active fourth quarter for fiscal year 2013 the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of merger and acquisition fees were technology services energy technology financial services healthcare and general industrials capital markets activities in our canadian operations have remained sluggish throughout fiscal year 2013 continuing to reflect the adverse market conditions which existed throughout the prior fiscal year particularly in the businesses in which we focus such as natural resourcesthe primary contributor to our fixed income investment banking revenues in fiscal year 2013 is our public finance investment banking operations the volume of our lead and comanaged public finance underwritings increased significantly over the prior year this favorable comparison is in part due to the positive impact of the inclusion of the public finance operations we acquired from morgan keegan in our results for an entire yearthe decrease in tax credit syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2013 results from an increase in the amount of fee revenues that have been deferred to be recognized at later dates upon completion of certain revenue recognition criteria the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during fiscal year 2013 is slightly higher than in the prior yeardespite our increase in fixed income trading capacity resulting from the morgan keegan acquisition our trading profit results for fiscal year 2013 while positive overall were unfavorably impacted by adverse conditions in the municipal fixed income market this market was impacted during fiscal year 2013 by a number of factors municipal fixed income markets were negatively impacted during the first quarter by discussions and rumors regarding potential changes in the tax laws pertaining to limits or caps on the taxexempt advantages of municipal fixed income instruments the fiscal cliff in response to these uncertainties interest rates on municipal securities increased during december 2012 which negatively impacted our trading results during the third quarter the 10year benchmark interest rate increased over 60 basis points in a very short period of time may through june 30 2013 resulting in very little demand for municipal fixed income securities in the market and valuation losses on municipal securities held in inventory which negatively impacted our third quarter trading results during the fourth quarter interest rates retreated somewhat back to their early may 2013 levels and our trading results were strong especially in municipal products during that period all of these factors considered in conjunction with what were strong municipal fixed income trading results in the prior year resulted in unfavorable trading profits in yearoveryear comparisonsnoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2013 increased 101 million or 13 over the prior year primarily driven by the inclusion of twelve months of the morgan keegan fixed income operations sales commission expense increased 41 million or 22 which is correlated with the increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues of 15 and includes the impact of the shift to a higher proportion of commissions being fixed income sales which are paid higher commissions including certain retentionrelated expenses implemented as part of the morgan keegan acquisition administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense increased 39 million or 10 primarily driven by the significant increase in personnel from the morgan keegan acquisition communications and information processing expense increased 7 million or 13 as a result of new technology initiatives and a full year of morgan keegan expenses goodwill impairment expense associated with rjes of 7 million see discussion below and a 6 million increase in losses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated variable interest entities discussed below contributed to the increase in other expense these increases are partially offset by a decrease in clearance and other expense of 5 million or 9 the decrease results primarily from the application of differing clearing charge allocation methodologies between the capital markets and the pcg segments within rjampa as compared to the historic mk amp co operations which favorably impact prior year comparisons refer to the pcg results of operations herein for a discussion of an offsetting unfavorable prior year comparison within that segmentduring the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 we incurred impairment expense associated with the rjes operations of 69 million however since we did not own 100 of rjes as of march 31 2013 23 million of this expense is attributable to others and is included in the offsetting

capital and private equity activities year ended september 30 2014 compared to the year ended september 30 2013  otherthe pretax loss generated by this segment decreased by approximately 48 million or 37 compared to the prior yearnet revenues in this segment decreased 81 million or 177 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in the current year arising from our private equity portfolio investments approximately 74 million of prior year revenues were associated with our indirect investment in albion an investment which was sold in april 2013 and therefore such revenues did not recur in the current year revenues associated with the remainder of our private equity portfolio have decreased 6 million compared to the prior year offsetting these decreases we realized a 6 million increase in the current year from gains on redemptions or sales of ars most notably arising from the current year redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars noninterest expenses decreased 74 million or 63 the decrease is primarily a result of a decrease in acquisition related expenses since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the acquisition related expenses incurred in the prior year were primarily comprised of expenses associated with the integration of morgan keegans operations into our own see note 3 of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on the components of the prior year expense the portion of revenue attributable to

valuation adjustments related to certain private equity investments we acquired as part of the morgan keegan acquisition increased 16 million over the prior year interest expense in fiscal year 2013 increased 18 million or 29 over the prior year the increase primarily results from our march 2012 issuances of 350 million 69 senior notes and 250 million 5625 senior notes as well as interest expense associated with borrowings under certain credit agreements with regions bank as more fully described in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k both of the march

at september 30 2014 are approximately 140 million or 1 more than our total assets as of september 30 2013 net bank loans receivable increased 21 billion due to significant growth of rj banks net loan portfolio during the year offsetting this increase segregated assets pursuant to federal regulations at september 30 2014 decreased 158 billion compared to september 30 2013 resulting from an increase during the current year in the capacity of the unaffiliated banks who participate in our rjbdp to accept client cash balances under the program with the increase in rjbdp capacity we increased the client cash balances redeposited with such unaffiliated banks which reduces the amount of brokerage client liabilities carried on our financial statements securities purchased under agreements to

redirected such shortterm investments to cash deposits with large canadian financial institutions which are included in our cash balance the investment balance associated with our available for sale securities portfolio decreased 137 million primarily as a result of redemptions maturations or sales of certain securities in the portfolio receivables from brokersdealers and clearing organizations

september 30 2014 compared to september 30 2013 is primarily due to the following a 199 billion decrease in brokerage client payables which occurred due to the increase in capacity with unaffiliated banks in our rjbdp program and the resultant increase in client cash balances that were redeposited with unaffiliated banks which reduces the amount of brokerage client payable balances carried on our

require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosuresfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs 69indexcertain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentslevel 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2014 9 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilities are instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis which are nearly unchanged from such measures as of september 30 2013financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 417 million as of september 30 2014 and represent 21 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2014 our private equity investments comprise 212 million or 51 of the total and our ars positions comprise 201 million or 48 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 52 million or 11 as compared to the september 30 2013 level primarily as a result of sales and redemptions of ars which generated proceeds of 512 million and a gain of 71 million in the year ended september 30 2014 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information level 3 assets represent 94 of total equity as of september 30 2014 reflecting a decrease from the 117 of total equity measure as of september 30 2013financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount to 58 thousand as of september 30 2014 and represent less than 1 of liabilities measured at fair value which is unchanged from such measure at september 30 2013valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2014 and 2013 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2014 are described below70indextrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2014 7 our gross trading security assets and 70 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2014 93 our gross trading security assets and 30 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2014 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 71indexavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 64 of the portfolio

recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and senior nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of senior securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor senior nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most senior nonagency securities at september 30 2014 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security

security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the security72indexfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity and merchant banking investments and comprise 51 of all of our level 3 assets as of september 30 2014 the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with third parties andor discounted cash flow models

by the fund manager investments valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchygoodwill impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2014 we performed a qualitative assessment evaluating the balances as of december 31 2013 for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of december 31 2013 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of our reporting units as of december 31 2013 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2013 that would cause us to update our latest annual impairment testingof our total september 30 2014 goodwill balance of

this form 10k for quantitative information regarding the allowance balances as of september 30 2014the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2014 includes 16 million resulting from the impact of our internal corporate loan classification changes as a result of the banking regulators annual shared national credit snc examination the snc exam included a review which represented 83 of the total held for investment corporate portfolio at such time the impact of the snc exam results from differences in judgment applicable to a limited number of the credits reviewed in the annual exam we incorporate all regulatory trends observed during each annual snc exam into our internal ratings methodology the limited number of loans with ratings differences the lengthy period between snc exams and the lack of a consistent pattern of credit characteristics leading to the loan ratings differences from year to year will cause the results of any years exam to be unpredictable and result in some changes from our internal ratings based on these factors however we do not believe the snc exam results to be indicative of current policies resulting in inaccurate loan classifications that need to be changed rather are differences in judgment and are not indicative of future trends in the subsequent year we do not always incorporate loan classification upgrades that result from the snc exam thus based on this policy the results of the annual snc exam on our portfolio may result in an increase to our provision for loan losses for the respective period these results become known given the relatively high percentage of snc loans in our total corporate loan portfolio and the probability that regulators are likely to have a different view on some loans in our portfolio the impact from each annual snc exam may be material to any fiscal years provision for loan losses should the credit ratings changes resulting from such exam be numerous significant meaning more than a one notch classification change or associated with considerably large loans in our portfolio the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2013 included 56 million resulting from the impact of the respective periods annual snc exam this prior year exam included a review which which represented 80 of the total held for investment corporate loan portfolio at such time at september 30 2014 the amortized cost of all rj bank loans was 111 billion and an allowance for loan losses of 1476 million was recorded against that balance the total allowance for loan losses is equal to 133 of the amortized cost of the loan portfoliothe uncertainty of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank74indexincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax
