certain other approved business activities such as offering insurance products independent registered investment advisory services and accounting and tax services over the past several fiscal years

regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the fed the fdic and the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb our brokerdealer subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory authorities which are discussed in the other regulations applicable to our operations portion of this sectionthe following discussion sets forth some of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to the financial services industry and provides some specific information relevant to us the regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of our clients customers the securities markets our depositors and the federal deposit insurance fund and not for the protection of our creditors or shareholders under certain circumstances these rules may limit our ability to make capital withdrawals from rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiariesto the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provisions a change in applicable statutes regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on our businessthe financial services industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under us federal and state laws10indexnew rules and regulations resulting from the doddfrank act in july 2010 the us government enacted financial services reform legislation known as the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes in the supervision and regulation of the financial industry designed to provide for greater oversight of financial industry participants reduce risk in banking practices and in securities and derivatives trading enhance public company corporate governance practices and executive compensation disclosures and provide greater protections to individual consumers and investors certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately however the details of some provisions remain subject to implementing regulations that are yet to be adopted by various applicable regulatory agencies furthermore many provisions of the doddfrank act are still subject to further rule making procedures and studies and will take effect over several yearsthe doddfrank act instructs us federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings studies and reports these regulatory agencies include the commodity futures trading commission the cftc the securities and exchange commission the sec the fed the occ the fdic the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council the fsoc as a result of doddfrank act rulemaking and other regulatory reforms we are currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct certain aspects of our business given that much of this regulatory development remains in a state of flux we cannot specifically quantify the potential impact that such regulations will have on our business and operations see item 1a risk factors within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations some of the changes that have been enacted under the doddfrank act thus far include the followingsince rj bank provides deposits covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is subject to the federal deposit insurance act in february 2011 under the provisions of the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment base in addition to other minor adjustments for banks with more than 10 billion in assets the fdics new rule changed the assessment rate calculation which relies on a scorecard designed to measure financial performance and ability to withstand stress in addition to measuring the fdics exposure should the bank fail this new rule became effective for rj bank beginning with the december 2013 assessment period in july 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act the cfpb began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and provide broad powers to supervise and enforce federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has supervisory and enforcement powers under the following consumer protection laws the equal credit opportunity act the truth in lending act real estate settlement procedures act fair credit reporting act fair debt collection act the consumer financial privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and certain other statutes at the beginning of fiscal year 2014 the cfpb assumed regulatory authority over rj bank for its compliance with various federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has proposed and finalized many rules since its establishment the majority of those became effective in early fiscal year 2014 the cfpb has authority to promulgate regulations issue orders draft policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions the creation of the cfpb has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws although the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain it could result in changes to pricing practices products and procedures it could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination remediation efforts and possible penaltiesmoreover in october 2012 under the provisions of the doddfrank act the fed fdic and occ jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies state member banks and savings and loan companies with total assets between 10 billion and 50 billion to conduct annual companyprepared stress tests report the results to their primary regulator and the fed and publish a summary of the results under the rules stress tests must be conducted using certain scenarios baseline adverse and severely adverse which the fed provides each year rjf was required to conduct its first stress test by march 31 2014 we submitted our initial stress testing results utilizing data as of september 30 2013 to the fed on march 31 2014 the doddfrank act also required that rjf begin publicly disclosing a summary of certain stress test results no later than june 30 2015 for the stress test cycle beginning on october 1 2014 rjf publicly disclosed the required summary of its stress test results on june 29 2015 in accordance with the abovementioned stress testing requirementsthe volcker ruleunder the provisions of the doddfrank act congress adopted the volcker rule which generally prohibits subject to exceptions insured depository institutions bank holding companies and their affiliates together banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund covered funds in december 2013 the cftc the occ the fed the fdic and the sec adopted a final version 11indexof the volcker rule certain elements of the final rule provide for phasingin over time however based upon our latest analysis and understandings of these regulations we do not anticipate that the volcker rule will have a material impact on our results of operations nevertheless due to its complexity and scope we continue to review the details contained in the volcker rule to assess its impact on our operationsthe volcker rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and imposes limitations on the extent to which banking entities are permitted to invest in certain covered funds eg hedge funds and private equity funds among others and requires that such investments be fully deducted from tier 1 capital proprietary trading is defined as engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in the purchase or sale of a financial instrument under the volcker rules perfund limits a banking entitys aggregate ownership in hedge funds and private equity funds cannot exceed three percent of tier 1 capital although the impact of such limit to rjfs investment portfolio is subject to further analysis additionally banking entities engaged in proprietary trading andor covered fund investments must establish a volcker rulespecific compliance program congress provided an exemption for certain permitted activities of banking entities such as underwriting market making hedging and risk managementthe volcker rule became effective as of april 1 2014 and all covered entities including rjf were required to conform to the volcker rules provisions on july 21 2015 the conformance period however on december 18 2014 the fed issued an order extending for an additional year the volcker rule conformance period for banking entities to conform their investments in and relationships with covered funds that may be subject to the volcker rule and were in place prior to december 31 2014 legacy funds the order also announced the feds intention to grant an additional oneyear extension of the conformance period until july 21 2017 this extension however only applies to legacy funds no extension was granted for the conformance period for proprietary trading activities banking entities may still apply for an additional fiveyear extension for continued investments with respect to an illiquid fund such an extension will only be granted after a demonstration that the investment is necessary to fulfill a contractual commitment effective on may 1 2010 we currently maintain a number of private equity investments some of which meet the definition of covered funds and therefore are subject to certain limitations under the covered funds provisions of the volcker rule the amount of future investments of this nature that we may make may be limited in order to maintain compliance levels specified by the volcker rule further subsequent interpretations of what constitutes covered funds under the final volcker rule may adversely impact our operations the recent extension of the conformance deadline provides us additional time to assess our holdings in the context of the new regulations and execute appropriate strategies to be in conformance with the volcker rulein july 2013 the occ the fed and the fdic released final united states basel iii regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the rule increases the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establishes a capital conservation buffer and makes selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the rule became effective for rjf on january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for several aspects of the rule including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and certain regulatory capital adjustments and deductions while we continue to evaluate the impact of these rules on both rjf and rj bank based on our current analyses we believe that both rjf and rj bank meet all capital adequacy requirements under the final rules however the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this report for more informationin july 2014 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds the amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds while preserving the benefits of the funds we do not sponsor any money market funds we utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes and offer to our clients money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternativesin september 2013 the sec issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors as required under the doddfrank act these rules which became effective on july 1 2014 impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities may result in the need for new written representations by issuers and may limit the manner in which we in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles interact with municipal issuers we registered as a municipal advisor with the sec in 2014 by virtue of such registration our municipal finance business is now subject to additional regulation and oversight by the sec in august 2014 the sec also announced that it will undertake a twoyear review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative moreover forthcoming rulemaking 12indexby the municipal securities rulemaking board may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local government are able to interact with outside finance professionals these new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients and may also have a negative shortterm impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape however we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations which are included in our capital markets segment other regulations applicable to our operationsthe sec is the federal agency charged with administration of the federal securities laws financial services firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in those states in which they conduct business rjampa and rjfs are currently registered as brokerdealers in all 50 states the sec recently adopted amendments most of which were effective october 2013 to its financial responsibility rules including changes to the net capital rule the customer protection rule the recordkeeping rules and the notification rules applicable to our brokerdealer subsidiaries we are currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on our brokerdealer subsidiaries however based on our current analyses we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on any of our brokerdealer subsidiaries pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct should be applicable to brokerdealers financial services firms are subject to regulation by various foreign governments securities exchanges central banks and regulatory bodies particularly in those countries where they have established offices outside of the united states we have additional offices in europe canada and latin america that are subject to local regulatory

prospectsrisks related to our business and industrydamage to our reputation could damage our businessesmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients customers investors and associates if we fail to deal with or appear to fail to deal with issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues money laundering cybersecurity and privacy recordkeeping sales and trading practices failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in our products a failure to maintain appropriate standards of service and quality or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and harm to our reputation further negative publicity regarding us whether or not true may also harm our future business prospects we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are generally affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including levels of economic output interest and inflation rates employment levels consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy these conditions may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits at times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low levels of economic output artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high rates of unemployment and significant uncertainty with regards to fiscal and monetary policy both domestically and abroad these 16indexconditions led to several changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while the global financial markets have showed general signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of short term interest rates a return to increased dislocations in the credit markets reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from a lower volume of trades we execute for our clients a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from the number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting financial advisory and other services increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses these periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short periods of time is limited  us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the middle east and in eastern europe and russia concerns about the european unions eu sovereign debt in recent years including the greek government bailout has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the eus financial support programs and the possibility exists that other eu member states may experience similar financial troubles in the future any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these matters could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity  our businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal and other policies adopted by various regulatory authorities of the united states foreign governments and domestic and international agencies the fed regulates the supply of money and credit in the united states fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies can also materially decrease the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict we may also be indirectly impacted by fiscal and monetary policy enacted in various global marketsus state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america market conditions in the united states and canada can be assessed through the following metrics the level and volatility of interest rates the rates of unemployment and underemployment real estate prices the level of consumer confidence changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others the deterioration of these factors can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earningslack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionmaintaining an appropriate level of liquidity or the amount of capital that is readily available for investment spending or to meet our contractual obligations is essential to our business our inability to maintain adequate levels of capital in the form of cash and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors selling assets at prices that may be less favorable to us and cutting or eliminating the dividends we pay to our shareholders some potential conditions that could negatively affect our liquidity include the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings changes imposed by regulators to our liquidity or capital requirements in our subsidiaries that may prevent the upstream of dividends in the form of cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for our company and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions the availability of outside financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on a variety of factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost and availability of funding may be adversely 17indexaffected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties as well as the stability of markets generallyif our credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our relationships with clients such a reduction in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our incremental borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to successfully obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information as of september 30 2015 a credit downgrade would also result in rjf incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its 300 million revolving credit facility executed on august 6 2015 in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  sources of liquidity for information on this revolving credit facilityfurthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the subsidiaries to their parent for the subsidiaries they supervise see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity riskwe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example changes in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilitymarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and private equity investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuerin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidityour venture capital and private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices 18indexsee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market riskwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes including bankruptcy lack of liquidity or operational failure among others we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers market making and underwriting businesses which exposes us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face the risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold certain securities loans and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses  we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase andor resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels on a daily basis a significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to concerns in the market about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or substitute collateral pledged in the case of aged securities failed to receive we may under industry regulations purchase the underlying securities in the market and seek reimbursement for any losses from the counterparty also we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if the clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit and margin and nonpurpose loans collateralized by securities among others we incur credit risk through our investments which include mbs collateralized mortgage obligations auction rate securities and other municipal securitiesour credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics acts of terrorism severe weather events or other adverse economic events could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit risk19indexour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and on advisory feesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management aum aum balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting marketmaking trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings we underwrite as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition we may incur losses as a result of proprietary positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activitiesfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments which are typically private limited partnership interests and securities that are not publicly traded there is risk that we may be unable to realize our investment objectives by sale or other disposition at attractive prices or that we may otherwise be unable to complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments through resale even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients furthermore although we do not hold any eu sovereign debt we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the eu sovereign debt circumstances defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us although we have not suffered any material or significant losses 20indexas a result of the failure of any financial counterparty any such losses in the future may have a material adverse effect on our results of operationswe have experienced increased pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilityour business continues to experience increased pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to increased price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we have experienced increased pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the increased use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginsregions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan mattersunder the definitive stock purchase agreement dated january 11 2012 entered into by rjf and regions governing our acquisition of morgan keegan the spa regions has ongoing obligations to continue to indemnify rjf with respect to certain litigation as well as other matters specifically the terms of the spa provide that regions will indemnify rjf for losses incurred in connection with legal proceedings pending as of the closing date april 2 2012 or commenced thereafter and related to preclosing matters that are received prior to april 2 2015 as well as any cost of defense pertaining thereto rjf is relying on regions to continue fulfilling its indemnification obligations under the spa with respect to such matters our inability to enforce these indemnification provisions or our failure to recover losses for which we are entitled to be indemnified could result in our incurring significant costs for defense settlement and any adverse judgments and resultantly have an adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and our regulatory capital levelssee note 21 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information regarding the indemnification from regionsgrowth of our business could increase costs and regulatory and integration risksintegrating acquired businesses providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve a number of risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expenses in connection with further expansion of our existing businesses or recruitment of financial advisors or in connection with strategic acquisitions or investments if and to the extent they arise from time to time our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues that are derived from such investment or growthexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves the hiring of additional personnel to monitor such procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate to appropriately monitor any new or expanded business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction moreover to the extent we pursue strategic acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or be unable to successfully integrate the operations of any acquired business into our existing business such acquisitions could be of significant size andor complexity this effort together with difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise equity capital or borrow to finance such acquisitions which could dilute our shareholders or increase our leverage any such borrowings might not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowings or perhaps at all we face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent 21indexentrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms and hedge funds among others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services the inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology including improvements made to internet connectivity networking and telecommunications systemsour ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our client base depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals particularly our managing directors and the members of our executive committees as well as employees and financial advisors to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel the reputations and relationships of our senior professionals with our clients are a critical element in obtaining and executing client engagement competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidityturnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably employers in the industry are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a new or existing competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenuesmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims in the past and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may currently be working for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who currently work for our competitors from joining uswe are exposed to operational riskour diverse operations expose us to risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems external events including technological or connectivity failures either at the exchanges in which we do business or between our data center operations processing sites or our branches our businesses depend on our ability to process and monitor on a daily basis a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse markets the inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses our financial accounting data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions or provide these services operational risk exists in every activity function or unit of our business and can take the form of internal or external fraud employment and hiring practices an error in meeting a professional obligation or failure to meet corporate fiduciary standards it is not always possible to deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our employees engage in misconduct our businesses would be adversely affected operational risk also exists in the event of business disruption system failures or failed transaction processing third parties with which we do business could also be a source of operational risk including with respect to breakdowns or failures of the systems or misconduct by the employees of such parties in addition as we change processes or introduce new products and services we may not fully appreciate 22indexor identify new operational risks that may arise from such changes increasing use of automated technology has the potential to amplify risks from manual or system processing errors including outsourced operationsour existing business contingency plan is intended to ensure that we have the ability to recover our critical business functions and supporting assets including staff and technology in the event of a systemic business interruption despite the diligence we have applied to the development and testing of our plans due to unforeseen factors our ability to conduct business may in any case be adversely affected by a disruption involving physical site access catastrophic events including weather related events events involving electrical environmental or communications malfunctions as well as events impacting services provided by others that we rely upon which could impact our employees or third parties with whom we conduct businesssee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing operational risk associate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harmthere have been a number of highlypublicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry and there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients if our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected our businesses depend on technologyour businesses rely extensively on electronic data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standardsour continued success depends in part upon our ability to successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and retain skilled information technology employees failure of our technology systems which could result from events beyond our control or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions the expectations of sound operational and informational security practices have risen among our clients and customers the public at large and regulators thus our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions cyberattacks and breakdowns our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however there can be no assurances that we will not suffer such losses in the future despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations notwithstanding the precautions taken by us and measures put in place if one or more of these events were to occur this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain including that of our clients and counterparties which is processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients and counterparties we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications 23indexwe may also be subject to litigation and financial losses that are neither insured nor covered under any of our current insurance policies a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulatorsextraordinary trading volumes beyond reasonably foreseeable spikes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably slow speed or even fail entirely while we have invested resources to maintain the reliability and scalability of our systems and maintain hardware to address extraordinary volumes there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle truly extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances systems failures and delays could occur and could cause among other things unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients or slower system response times resulting in client dissatisfaction due to transactions not being processed as quickly as desiredin providing services to clients we may manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through system failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damagessee item 7a quantitative and qualitative

of our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data center in the denver colorado area our

refer to the we are exposed to operational risk risk factor in this item 1a for a discussion of how weatherrelated events could impact our ability to conduct businesswe are exposed to litigation risks which could materially and adversely impact our business operations and prospectsmany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability arising out of the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant or codefendant in lawsuits and arbitrations involving primarily claims for damages the risks associated with potential litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability the failure of our advisors to fully understand investor needs or risk tolerances may result in the recommendation or purchase of a portfolio of assets that may not be suitable for the investor to the extent we fail to fully understand our clients or improperly advise them we could be found liable for losses suffered by such clients which could harm our business our private client group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related to the suitability of our investment advice based on our clients investment objectives the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operations24indexwith regard to morgan keegan a number of the types of claims and matters described above arising prior to our acquisition that are received prior to april 2 2015 are subject to indemnification from regions refer to the separate risk factor in this section entitled regions may fail to honor its indemnification obligations associated with morgan keegan matters for a discussion of the risks associated with these indemnificationssee item 3 legal proceedings in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal riskthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective and consequently based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the financial accounting standards board the fasb and the sec have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 in this report and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10kin december 2012 the fasb issued a proposed standard on accounting for credit losses the standard would replace multiple existing impairment models including the replacement of the incurred loss model for loans with an expected loss model the fasb announced it will establish the effective date when it issues the final standard we cannot predict when a final standard will be issued when it will be made effective what its final provisions will encompass or the potential impact its eventual adoption may have on our retained earnings our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be fully effective our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we utilize limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes 25indexfurther our risk management methods may not effectively predict future risk exposures which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to adequately manage our growth or to effectively manage our risk could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition financial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts all of which are under growing scrutiny by federal and state regulators in the united states our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business we have procedures and controls in place to address conflicts of interest management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities through numerous transactions obligations and interests with and among our clients the actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this reportwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to a number of risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability less established regulatory regimes changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative economic and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations and our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from the trading of nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the abovementioned factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly in emerging market countries are generally smaller and less developed less liquid and more volatile than us trading markets additionally a political economic or financial disruption in a country or region could adversely impact our business and increase volatility in financial markets generallywe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion of employeerelated health care benefits plans we fund among others while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage that is appropriate to our assessment of risk we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if in the future our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our businessrisks related to our regulatory environmentfinancial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actionsfirms in the financial services industry have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment which will become even more stringent in light of recent wellpublicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators including the sec the fed the occ and the cfpb in addition to stock exchanges finra and state attorneys general penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and sros each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services including but not limited to the authority to fine us and to grant cancel restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses for example the failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the exchange act on brokerdealers and the investment advisers act of 1940 on investment advisers including recordkeeping advertising and operating requirements disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities 26indexor by the investment company act of 1940 the 1940 act could result in investigations sanctions and reputational damage we also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec other us or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or sros eg finra that supervise the financial markets substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could harm our business prospects through adverse financial effects and reputational harmchanges in regulations resulting from either the doddfrank act or any new regulations or laws may affect our businessesthe market and economic conditions over the past several years have directly led to a demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the united states and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry see item 1 regulation in this report for a discussion of such changes including the volcker rule the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act will have on us the financial industry and the economy at large cannot be specifically ascertained until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented nevertheless it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of our assets require us to alter at least some of our business practices impose additional costs and otherwise adversely affect our businessesthe doddfrank act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our businesses include the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading and restrictions on proprietary trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain thresholds established under the doddfrank act these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has been active in investigating products services and operations of credit providers including banks for compliance with various consumer protection laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act and the real estate settlement procedures act any actions taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make them less attractive and restrict our ability to offer them in addition to increasing our regulatory and compliance costs to the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with usin december 2013 the final version of the volcker rule was adopted see item 1 regulation in this report for discussion of the volcker rule and became effective april 1 2014 we were required to comply with the volcker rules provisions starting on july 21 2015 although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading for our own trading account due to our underwriting and market making activities the volcker rule will likely adversely affect our results of operations through increased operational and compliance costs possible reductions in our trading revenues and changes to our principal capital private equity investmentsthe basel iii capital standards will impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitabilityin july 2013 the fed the occ and the fdic released final us basel iii regulatory capital rules which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act these rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets the regulatory capital rule became effective for us january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for several of its provisions including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition or prospects could be adversely affected we continue to evaluate the impact of the capital rules on both rj bank and rjf27indexfailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators and accordingly must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classification for both rjf and rj bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by u s federal regulators based on components of our capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets tier 1 capital to average assets as defined in the regulations and under rules defined in basel iii common equity tier 1 capital to riskweighted assets failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and our financial conditionas more fully discussed in item 1 regulation in this report rjf is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the fed while we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capitaladditionally as rjf is a holding company it depends on dividends distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund payments of its obligations including debt service we are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and finras net capital rule which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below its requirements in addition our canadabased brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by iiroc regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds the holding company needs to make payments on any such obligationssee note 26 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on regulations and capital requirementswe operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionthe securities industry is subject to extensive and constantly changing regulation and brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including but not limited to sales and trading methods trade practices among brokerdealers use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts recordkeeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees a violation of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to civil and criminal liability sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business any of those events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operationswe are subject to financial holding company regulatory reporting requirements including the maintenance of certain riskbased regulatory capital levels that could impact various capital allocation decisions of one or more of our businesses a failure to satisfy the riskbased regulatory capital levels could require us to halt certain activities permitted under the bank holding company act of 1956 however due to our strong current capital position we do not anticipate that these capital level requirements will have any negative impact on our future business activities see the section entitled business  regulation of item 1 in this report for additional informationas a financial holding company we are regulated by the fed rj bank is regulated by the occ the fed the cfpb and the fdic this oversight includes but is not limited to scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has caused increased attention on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by us regulators that oversee the financial services industry could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our 28indexbusiness financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes in federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations the sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the 1940 act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares the staff of the secs office of compliance inspections and examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to subtransfer agents and subadministrators for services that may be deemed to be distributionrelated any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry their impact cannot be predicted at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds investment advisors and brokerdealers as some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the sec increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities it is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business for example pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for brokerdealers however any such standard if mandated would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliancein addition the us and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry and may continue to take further actions including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries for example several states and municipalities in the united states have recently adopted paytoplay rules which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees such paytoplay rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business additionally the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors is periodically reexamined and may in the future be limited or modified a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research including external research paid for with soft dollars this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as third party provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars is limited we may have to bear some of these additional costs furthermore new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs for example many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund businesses or other businesses and changes to the laws rules and regulations in the united states related to the overthecounter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration recordkeeping and reporting obligationssee the section entitled

with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined not to be meaningfulexecutive overviewwe operate as a financial services and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2015 compared with the year ended september 30 2014 for the sixth consecutive year we achieved record net revenues for the fiscal year 52 billion in fiscal year 2015 a 339 million or 7 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues total client assets under administration increased to 480 billion at september 30 2015 a 1 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting results and high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors which more than offset the decline in the us equity markets for the year primarily occurring in our fourth fiscal quarterwe also achieved a record level of net income of 502 million an increase of 22 million or 5 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 343 increased 011 or 3 over the prior year amount noninterest expenses increased 278 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increased revenues in addition as a result of various growth strategies across our businesses we experienced an increase in our business development expenses our strategic efforts during the year to continually improve the technology available to our financial advisors as well as the additional costs of compliance with various new rules and regulations impacting our industry are factors impacting an increase in our communications and information processing expenses the provision for loan losses increased significantly year over year as the prior year benefited to a greater extent than the current year from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the combination of the above noted factors even after consideration of the incremental expenses resulting from activities associated with the strategic growth initiatives that should favorably impact future revenues resulted in a pretax margin on net revenues of 153 a level that is nearly equivalent to the 154 pretax margin on net revenues in the prior yeara summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 35 billion a 228 million or 7 increase over the prior year pretax income also established a record at 342 million a 12 million or 4 increase over the prior year the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues client assets under administration of the private client group increased 1 over the prior year level to 4533 billion at september 30 2015 the increase in commission revenues and client assets have resulted primarily from successful recruiting of financial advisors and high levels of financial advisor retention we had our second best financial advisor recruiting year ever in fiscal year 2015 with a net increase of 331 financial advisors over the year to 6596 affiliated financial advisors as of september 30 2015 there was an overall net increase in client assets despite the impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased 5 as we incurred increases in certain costs associated with the successful recruiting efforts and continued information system improvements on july 31 2015 we completed our 35indexacquisition of the producers choice llc tpc a private insurance and annuity marketing organization based in troy michigan our acquisition of tpc brings more life insurance and annuity experts to the firm to support financial advisors and their clientsthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 960 million a 7 million or 1 increase over the prior year pretax income was 107 million a decrease of 24 million or 18 compared to the prior year fiscal year 2015 reflected new record levels of merger and acquisition fees and tax credit fund syndication fees commission revenues from fixed income institutional sales increased over the prior year level resulting in part from growth in our public finance activities however equity underwriting revenues declined compared to the prior year as a result of weakness in both the energy and real estate sectors which also led to a decline in commission revenues on equity products the net profit generated by this segment was negatively impacted by increased costs some of which result from our efforts during the year to broadly build out certain sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in certain sectors which we believe present solid longterm opportunities for future revenue growth the continued difficult market environment in canada negatively impacted this segments revenues and profitabilityour asset management segment generated record net revenues of 392 million a 23 million or 6 increase over the prior year pretax income was a record 135 million a 7 million or 5 increase over the prior year financial assets under management increased 1 from the prior year to 652 billion as of september 30 2015 the increase resulted from net inflows of client assets which more than offset the unfavorable impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions on april 30 2015 we completed our acquisition of cougar global investments limited cougar an asset management firm based in toronto canada that markets its investment services to high net worth individuals families foundations trusts and institutions in canada and the united statesrj bank generated record net revenues of 414 million a 63 million or 18 increase over the prior year pretax income was a record 279 million a 36 million or 15 increase over the prior year net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding coupled with a modest increase in net interest margin our provision for loan losses increased 10 million or 74 compared to the prior year we incurred substantial provision for loan losses associated with loan growth in both years however the majority of the yearoveryear increase resulted from the prior year benefiting to a greater extent than the current year from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the credit characteristics of the loan portfolio generally improved over the year reflecting the positive impact of improved economic conditions activities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that was 19 million less than the prior year net revenues in this segment increased 25 million resulting from increases in revenues associated with our private equity portfolio investments and an increase in gains resulting from our auction rate securities portfolio sales and redemption activities as a result of the increase in private equity investment revenues the portion of this segments pretax income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests also increasedour fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate was 371 up from the 358 in the prior year as a result of the fiscal year 2015 decline in equity market values compared to positive markets in fiscal year 2014 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses arising from the value of our companyowned life insurance portfolio had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by 12 compared to the prior year effective tax rateconsistent with our growth strategies we completed two acquisitions during the year cougar and tpc we continue to evaluate future opportunities but remain committed to our strategy that our acquisitions must meet our strategic growth objectives involve entities that share our culture of conservatism and clientfirst values and be executed at purchase prices that provide us opportunities to increase our shareholders valueduring the year we implemented the new basel iii regulatory capital rules a change which did not have a significant impact on our regulatory capital ratios we have published the results of the 2015 doddfrank act mandated stress test the results of which indicated that both rjf and rj bank have sufficient capital to successfully navigate a severe and prolonged economic downturn while still maintaining capital levels that exceed both regulatory requirements and higher management thresholds throughout the course of the severely adverse scenario the volume of possible regulatory changes that impact the businesses in which we operate continues to grow and evolve regulatory rulemaking activities that have arisen during the year include the dol proposed rule enhancing standards for individuals providing investment advice to retirement plans their participants or beneficiaries we are continuing our study and evaluation of the proposal the total impact of the standard once finalized and implemented on our business is unknown at this 36indextime we continue to monitor the impact of proposed future legislation while implementing new regulations we presently do not expect currently enacted legislation to have a significant adverse direct impact on our operations as a whole however we continue to evaluate the specific impacts of eachyear ended september 30 2014 compared with the year ended september 30 2013we achieved record net revenues of 49 billion in fiscal year 2014 a 376 million or 8 increase compared to the prior year the increase generated by our ongoing operations is even greater than that amount after factoring in the 74 million of revenue reflected in fiscal year 2013 that was associated with a private equity investment we sold in that year all four operating segments achieved record levels of net revenues total client assets under administration increased to 475 billion at september 30 2014 a 12 increase over the prior year level we also achieved a record level of net income in fiscal year 2014 to 480 million an increase of 113 million or 31 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved record levels of profitability fully diluted earnings per share of 332 in fiscal year 2014 increased 074 or 29 over the fiscal year 2013 amount after excluding the acquisition related and other nonrecurring expenses we incurred in fiscal year 2013 our adjusted net income in fiscal year 2014 increased 61 million or 15 compared to fiscal year 2013 a nongaap measure1 the increase in net income in fiscal year 2014 over the prior year level is even more significant given that the fiscal year 2013 net income included 14 million after the attribution to noncontrolling interests arising from our indirect investment in albion medical holdings inc albion a private equity holding which was sold during fiscal year 2013noninterest expenses increased 254 million in fiscal year 2014 or 7 compared to the prior year the increase in fiscal year 2014 is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses which were partially offset by the decrease in acquisition related expenses acquisition and integration related expenses in fiscal year 2014 were no longer material for separate reporting since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 the combination of increasing net revenues and overall expense control in fiscal year 2014 helped us achieve a 154 pretax margin on net revenuesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal year 2014 as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated record net revenues of 33 billion in fiscal year 2014 a 12 increase while pretax income increased 100 million or 43 to a record 330 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues commission expenses increased in proportion to the increase in corresponding commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased by 3 client assets under administration of the private client group increased 12 over the prior year level to 4506 billion at september 30 2014 net inflows of client assets in fiscal year 2014 were positively impacted by successful recruiting of financial advisors among other favorable factorsthe capital markets segment generated record net revenues of 953 million in fiscal year 2014 a 3 increase while pretax income increased 28 million or 28 to a record 131 million increases in trading profits merger and acquisition fee revenues equity underwriting fee revenues and institutional sales commissions on equity products more than offset a decline in institutional sales commissions on fixed income products the decline in institutional fixed income commission revenues results from challenging fixed income market conditions during fiscal year 2014 due to economic uncertainty historically low interest rates relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and decreased customer trading volumes our asset management segment generated record net revenues of 370 million in fiscal year 2014 a 26 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 33 to a record 128 million financial assets under management increased 15 from the prior year to 646 billion as of september 30 2014 both strong net inflows of client assets and market appreciation contributed to the increase we also earned nearly 10 million in performance fees in fiscal year 2014 compared to nearly 2 million in the prior year as a result of positive net performance from certain of our managed funds a portion of which are attributable to noncontrolling interests which contributed to the increase in revenues and pretax income 1refer to the discussion and reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap results in the reconciliation of the gaap results to the nongaap measures section of this mdampa37indexrj bank generated record net revenues of 352 million in fiscal year 2014 a 1 increase while pretax income decreased 25 million or 9 to 243 million net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding offset in large part by a lower net interest margin the provision for loan losses increased in fiscal year 2014 primarily as the result of significant loan portfolio growth partially offset by decreases resulting from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio reflecting the positive impact from improved economic conditions noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses increased 19 millionactivities in our other segment resulted in a pretax loss that is 48 million less in fiscal year 2014 than the prior year our noninterest expenses decreased substantially as we are no longer incurring acquisition and integration related costs since our integration of morgan keegan was substantially complete as of september 30 2013 in addition fiscal year 2013 included significant revenues and pretax income associated with our indirect investment in albion which was sold in april 2013 thus having a significant impact on comparisons to the prior year our fiscal year 2014 effective tax rate was 358 up from the 349 in fiscal year 2013 our fiscal year 2013 effective tax rate included a nonrecurring tax benefit resulting from a change in managements repatriation strategy of certain

analysiswe have certain assets and liabilities primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments which are subject to changes in interest rates and would have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance in the event of a change in shortterm interest rates a gradual increase in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this report which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a 12 month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankbased upon our analysis performed as of september 30 2015 we estimate that a 100 basis point instantaneous rise in shortterm interest rates would result in an increase in our pretax income of approximately 150 million over the subsequent twelve month period approximately 55 of such an increase would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest income from client cash balances in our multibank sweep program and the discontinuance of money market fund fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments this estimate is based on static balances as of september 30 2015 and a conservative assumption related to interest credited to our clients on their cash balances in such an interest rate environment the actual amount of any increase we would realize in the future will ultimately be based on a number of factors including but not limited to the actual change in balances the rapidity and magnitude of the increase in interest rates the competitive landscape at such time and the returns on comparable investments all of which will factor into the interest rates we pay on client cash balances the great majority of the benefit to pretax income from an increase in shortterm interest rates would be expected to arise from the first 100 basis point increase as we presume any further increases in shortterm interest rates would be passed along to clients through our various cash sweep programs and thus such additional interest revenues and interest sensitive fees would be offset by increases of

policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements net interest revenue in the private client group is generated by client balances predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations less interest paid on client cash balances the client interest program we also utilize a multibank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue the cash sweep program known as the raymond james bank deposit program rjbdp is a multibank rj bank and several non43indexaffiliated banks program under which clients cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are redeposited into interestbearing deposit accounts up to 250000 per bank for individual accounts and up to 500000 per bank for joint accounts

and finra rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions sec regulations however restrict the use of clients funds derived from pledging and lending clients securities as well as funds awaiting investment to the financing of margin account balances to the extent not so used such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the

fiscal year exceed our historical benchmark averages nothwithstanding the future impact of changes in the overall economy and more specifically their impact on future equity markets and fixed income markets factors which we have no control we believe that this increase in productive financial advisors is a positive indication of potential future revenue growth in this segment44indexyear ended

administration increased to 4533 billion an increase of 27 billion or 1 compared to september 30 2014 the year over year increase in client assets was driven by positive net inflows generated by financial advisor retention and recruiting results as the equity markets in the us were down compared to the prior year the most significant increase in these revenues arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 212 million or 17 and was partially offset by a 27 million or 9 decrease in commissions on equity products a 13 million or 15 decrease in new issue sales credits due to a decrease in equity underwritings and a 4 million or 5 decrease in commissions on fixed income products fiscal year 2015 includes a 7 million decrease in mutual fund commission revenues due to the resolution of a mutual fund share class issue that resulted in refunds of commissions being paid during the year to certain of our clients despite this unusual item mutual fund commission revenues still increased 2 million commission revenues on equity products have decreased in our canadian brokerdealer subsidiary as a result of the weaker canadian currency compared to the us dollar as well as the overall challenging canadian market conditions that existed throughout the fiscal year commission earnings on fixed income products decreased primarily due to the continuation of historically low interest rates which continue to result in challenging fixed income market conditions total account and service fee revenues increased 52 million or 13 mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 37 million or 17 primarily as a result of an increase in education and marketing support ems fees which include notransactionfee ntf program revenues and mutual fund omnibus fees all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios increases in such revenues are a result of increases in the number of positions for existing fund families on the omnibus platform as well as new fund families joining the omnibus program client account and service fees increased 14 million or 9 as a result of the changes made in many of our fee schedules implemented since december 2013 in addition transaction handling fees in feebased accounts increased due to the increased number of transactions fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks increased due to higher average balances in the program and sbl affiliate servicing fees increased refer to the rj bank results of operations in this report for additional information on sbl activities as sbl balances have continued to growpcg net interest is relatively

rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average margin loan balances outstanding the rate of growth in margin loan balances in fiscal year 2015 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our sbl product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest rate environment that existed during fiscal year 2015 and the related low net interest spreads earned there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash balances refer to the discussion of how the pretax income of this segment could be favorably impacted

in the us which were generally improved as compared to fiscal year 2013 and increased financial advisor productivity the most significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2014 arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 245 million or 24 and commission revenues on mutual fund products which increased 57 million or 9 primarily due to increases in trailing commissions on mutual fund products partially offset by a 21 million or 21 decrease in commissions on fixed income products commission earnings on fixed income products in fiscal year 2014 decreased

products we distribute in fiscal year 2014 we continued to implement changes in the data sharing arrangements with many mutual fund companies converting from a networking to an omnibus arrangement the fees earned from omnibus arrangements are greater than those under networking arrangements in order to compensate us for the additional reporting requirements performed by the brokerdealer under omnibus arrangements during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased

public finance activities during the year offsetting this increase institutional equity sales commissions decreased 14 million or 5 resulting primarily from decreased equity underwriting activities throughout fiscal year 2015 particularly in the energy and real estate sectors merger and acquisitions and advisory fee revenues increased 11 million or 7 reaching a record 162 million we experienced significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arising from our us operations led by our technology services sector and reflecting the benefit of prior years investments in other business sectors the portion of these revenues arising from our canadian operations decreased significantly due to the difficult canadian equity market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 especially in the natural resources sector our net trading profits decreased 5 million or 8 typically our trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities however in fiscal year 2015 the primary reason for the decrease is 5 million of realized trading losses arising in our canadian operations primarily attributable to a loss on an equity underwriting position despite the continuation of the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 fixed income trading results were solid and steady throughout the year assisted by the trading profits generated on gnma and fnma

from our public finance business activities increased 11 million or 17tax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased by 10 million or 29 due to a 17 increase in the volume of tax credit fund

institutional sales commission revenues business development expenses increased 4 million or 9 predominately in our equity capital markets operations representing recruiting and other costs as they pursue opportunities for future growth and revenues clearance and other expense increased 13 million or 19 primarily due to a higher volume of trades as reflected by the increase in institutional

equity sales commissions in fiscal year 2014 increased 14 million or 6 resulting from both favorable equity markets throughout the year and an active new issue market environment at certain times during fiscal year 2014 the active new issue market resulted in a 14 increase in equity underwriting fee revenues to 100 million underwriting fee revenues increased in both our domestic as well as our canadian equity capital markets operations the sectors in which we generated the most significant amounts of underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 were real estate financial services and energyinstitutional fixed income sales commissions in fiscal year 2014 decreased 81 million or 25 primarily due to the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2014 resulting from economic uncertainty the continuation of historically low interest rates periods of relatively low volatility of benchmark interest rates and the resulting decreased customer trading volumes despite such conditions trading results were solid and steady during fiscal year 2014 resulting in a 32 million or 112 improvement over fiscal year 2013 which included a quarter the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 which was particularly negative these trading profits were generated primarily from fixed income securities these favorable trading results in fiscal year 2014 were achieved even as

most significant amounts of such fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 were technology services healthcare energy financial services technology and general industrialstax credit fund syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2014 increased by 10 million or 40 due to a 16 increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during fiscal year 2014 and the recognition of certain revenues in fiscal year 2014 that were associated with partnership interests sold in prior years which had been deferred in those years fiscal year 2014 recognition of these previously deferred revenues result from the favorable resolution of certain conditions associated with the partnership interests which once favorably resolved result in the recognition of previously deferred revenuesnoninterest expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased 8 million or 1 compared to fiscal year 2013 administrative and incentive compensation and benefit expense in fiscal year 2014 increased 23 million or 6 compared to fiscal year 2013 offset by a decrease in sales commission expense of 30 million or 13 which is directly correlated with the 12 decrease in overall institutional sales commission revenues incentive compensation expense increases in fiscal year 2014 were primarily the result of higher volumes of underwriting mergers amp acquisitions and advisory fees investment

certain performance targets amounted to 5 million a decrease of 5 million from the amount earned in the prior year refer to the information presented above regarding the increases in the balances of

a 3 million or 16 increase in communications and information support processing expense and a 7 million or 14 increase in other expenses the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense is primarily attributable to increased fees paid to external managers for raymond james consulting services and uma programs which have both experienced increases in asset levels compared to the prior year the increase in communications and information processing expense result from additional costs associated with supporting the steadily increasing levels of assets under management as well as the growth in asset levels in our nondiscretionary assetbased programs the increase in other expense is primarily due to eagles share of certain costs incurred in the organization and startup of a new fund in which eagle serves as the subadvisor  noncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries including clarivest total segment net

increase in rj trust client assets compared to the prior year to 338 billion as of september 30 2014expenses in fiscal year 2014 increased by approximately 40 million or 21 primarily resulting from a

the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense in fiscal year 2014 is directly related to the increase in assets in programs managed by external managers such assets are included within the uma and raymond james consulting services program asset under management balances the increase in other expense in fiscal year 2014 is primarily due to increases in the costs incurred so that certain funds sponsored by eagle are available as investment choices on the platforms of other brokerdealers and increases in expenses of rj trust resulting from the increase in client assets the increase in administrative and performance based incentive compensation in fiscal year 2014 is a result of the combination of increases in performance compensation which is directly related to the increase in

also realized an increase in revenues arising from the sale or redemption activities in our ars portfolio of 4 million which were offset by certain foreign currency translation losses that primarily result from the weakened canadian dollar and decreases in the valuation of other investments primarily in managed equities the current year ars portfolio gain is primarily the result of an 11 million gain on the sale of all of our jefferson county alabama limited obligation school warrants ars in the prior year gains resulting from sales and redemption activities in our ars portfolio were primarily comprised of a 55 million gain on the redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests increased 8

fiscal year 2014 decreased 81 million or 177 the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues in fiscal year 2014 arising from our private equity portfolio investments approximately 74 million of fiscal year 2013 revenues were associated with our indirect investment in albion an investment which was sold in april 2013 and therefore such revenues did not recur in fiscal year 2014

and capital requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements refer to notes 5 and 6 in our notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for these disclosuresfair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assets70indexin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentslevel 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2015 79 of our total assets and 32 of our total liabilities are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of september 30 2014 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 86 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilitiesfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 356 million as of september 30 2015 and represent 17 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2015 our private equity investments comprise 209 million or 59 of the total and our ars positions comprise 139 million or 39 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 62 million or 15 as compared to the september 30 2014 level primarily as a result of sales and redemptions of ars which generated proceeds of 64 million and a gain of 11 million in the year ended september 30 2015 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information level 3 assets represent 74 of total equity as of september 30 2015 reflecting a decrease from the 94 of total equity measure as of september 30 2014financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount to 58 thousand as of september 30 2015 and represent less than 1 of liabilities measured at fair value which is unchanged from such measure at september 30 2014valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial 71indexinstrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2015 and 2014 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2015 are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2015 7 of our gross trading security assets and 62 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2015 93 of our gross trading security assets and 38 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2015 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset 72indexor an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bank the rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelsavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 73 of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 27 is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchydebt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive loss income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most nonagency securities at september 30 2015 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of 73indexthe ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments held in our other segment consist of various direct and third party private equity investments and comprise 59 of all of our level 3 assets as of september 30 2015 the valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrumentprivate equity investments are carried at estimated fair value they are valued initially at the transaction price until significant transactions or developments indicate that a change in the carrying values of these investments is appropriate the carrying values of these investments are adjusted based on financial performance investmentspecific events financing and sales transactions with

impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment evaluating the balances as of december 31 2014 for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of december 31 2014 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill 74indexallocated to any of our reporting units as of december 31 2014 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2014 that would cause us to update our latest

uncertainty of the real estate and credit markets continues to influence the complexity involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bankincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is

appropriate statistical technique for estimating potential losses in trading portfolios due to typical adverse market movements over a specified time horizon with a suitable confidence levelwe apply the feds market risk rule mrr for the purpose of calculating our capital ratios the mrr also known as the riskbased capital guidelines market risk rule released by the fed occ and fdic requires us to calculate var numbers for all of our trading portfolios including fixed income equity foreign exchange and derivative instrumentsto calculate var we use historical simulation this approach assumes that historical changes in market conditions such as in interest rates and equity prices are representative of future changes the simulation is based on daily market data for the previous twelve months var is reported at a 99 confidence level for a oneday time horizon assuming that future market conditions change as they have in the past twelve months we would expect to incur losses greater than those predicted by our oneday var estimates about once every 100 trading days or about three times per year on average for regulatory capital calculation purposes we also report var numbers for a tenday time horizonwe continually monitor our var computational model to ensure its calculated results accurately portray risks within our trading portfolios during the quarter ended march 31 2015 after independent validation and regulatory approval we implemented a new var model for measuring the market risk of all of our trading portfolios in comparing var results from the old model versus the new one all else equal the var from the new model is higher than that from the old model because the new model incorporates an expanded set of risk factors including those captured previously within stress testing the feds mrr requires us to perform daily back testing procedures of our var model whereby we compare each days projected var to its regulatorydefined daily trading losses which excludes fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading based on these daily ex ante versus ex post comparisons we verify that the number of times that regulatorydefined daily trading losses exceed var is consistent with our expectations at a 99 confidence level during the twelve months ended september 30 2015 our regulatorydefined daily loss in our trading portfolios exceeded our predicted var four timesthe following table sets forth the high low and daily average var for all of our trading portfolios including fixed income equity and derivative instruments as of

this date was computed under a previous historical computational modelthe modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var and different assumptions or approximations could produce materially different var estimates as a result var statistics are more reliable when used as indicators of risk levels and trends within a firm than as a basis for inferring differences in risktaking across

consecutive trading days accordingly management applies additional controls including position limits a daily review of trading results review of the status of aged inventory independent controls on pricing monitoring of concentration risk and review of issuer ratings as well as stress testing we utilize stress testing to complement our var analysis so as to measure risk under historical and

portfolio that is comprised of campi loans taxexempt loans sbl and commercial and residential real estate loans as well as mbs cmos sba loan securitizations and a trading portfolio of corporate loans those earning assets are primarily funded by rj banks obligations to customers ie customer deposits based on its current earning asset portfolio rj bank is subject to interest rate risk the current economic environment has led to an extended period of low market interest rates as a result the majority of rj banks adjustable rate assets and liabilities have experienced a reduction in interest rate yields and costs that reflect these very low market interest rates during the year rj bank has focused its interest rate risk analysis on the risk of market interest rates rising rj bank analyzes interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both in a range of interest rate scenariosone of the objectives of rj banks asset liability management committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rj banks interest rate risk including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right but not the obligation to repay before the scheduled maturity to ensure that rj bank is within its limits established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios rj bank utilizes an internally developed assetliability model using standard industry software to analyze the available data the model estimates changes in net interest income by calculating interest income and interest expense from existing assets and liabilities using current repricing prepayment and volume assumptions various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income in february 2015 we implemented a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps as a result of rj banks asset and liability management process described above for further information regarding this risk management objective see the discussion of the rj bank

statements of income and comprehensive income83indexcredit riskcredit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activitieswe are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performanceour client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin accounts which are monitored daily and are collateralized we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a regular basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will renege on the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss however most private clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed we offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss in the event that such borrower declares bankruptcy or is no longer affiliated with us historically such losses have not been significant due to our strong advisor retention and successful collection effortswe are subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions extend large loans to or have large commitments with a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry securities purchased under agreements to resell consist primarily of securities issued by the us government or its agencies receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made including underwritings may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses we seek to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the counterparty the size of the position or commitment the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstandingthe valuation of the nonagency cmos held as available for sale securities by rj bank is impacted by

corporate sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where rj bank has a concentration could result in large provisions for loan losses andor chargeoffsrj banks strategy for credit risk management includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all corporate residential and sbl credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification on a geographic industry and customer level regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate loans and individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes an annual independent review of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with corporate and residential mortgage credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information rj bank seeks to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for probable incurred loan losses rj bank utilizes a comprehensive credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate loans and related unfunded lending commitments including the probability of default andor loss given default of each corporate loan and commitment outstanding for its sbl and residential mortgage loans rj bank utilizes the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans84indexrj banks allowance for loan losses methodology are described in the critical accounting estimates section of this item 7 and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as rj banks loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for loan losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as followscampi loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentcre construction loans in this segment have similar risk characteristics of loans in the cre segment as described above in addition project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors may affect the credit quality of loans in this segment with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in all of these areas may significantly affect the credit quality of the loans in this segmenttaxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentresidential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or other types of nontraditional loan products loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segmentsbl loans in this segment are secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of securities which will bring the loan current and may bring the loan within the prescribed ltv guidelines in evaluating credit risk rj bank considers trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors during fiscal year 2015 corporate profit levels continued to improve but have remained weak as compared to historic levels unemployment rates have declined retail sales continue to be sluggish and credit quality trends while improved in some sectors remain somewhat tenuous the volatility in residential home values in certain geographies has continued to have an impact on residential mortgage loan performance all of these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs however during fiscal year 2015 corporate borrowers have continued to access the markets for new equity and debt several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for loan losses at september 30 2015 including the risk profile of the portfolios net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and delinquency ratios rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio rj bank further stratified the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio based upon updated ltv estimates with higher reserve percentages allocated to the higher ltv loans finally rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio rj bank determined the allowance that was required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis rj bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate 85indexchanges in the allowance for loan losses of rj bank are as follows for the year

other collateralized financingswe purchase securities under shortterm agreements to resell reverse repurchase agreements additionally we sell securities under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements both reverse repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financings and are carried at contractual amounts plus accrued interest our policy is to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under the reverse repurchase agreements to ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient the securities are valued daily and collateral is obtained from or returned to the counterparty when contractually required these reverse repurchase agreements may result in credit exposure in the event the counterparty to the transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations other collateralized financings may include secured call loans receivable held by rj ltd when executed these financings represent loans of excess cash to financial institutions which are fully collateralized by canadian treasury bills or provincial obligations and bear interest at call loan ratesfinancial instruments owned financial instruments sold but not yet purchased and fair valuefinancial instruments owned and financial instruments sold but not yet purchased are recorded at fair value fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement datein determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurementslevel 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securitieslevel 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mortgagebacked securities mbs our derivative instruments corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly small business administration sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include auction rate securities ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrumentwe offset our long and short positions for a particular security recorded at fair value as part of our trading instruments long positions and trading instruments sold but not yet purchased short positions when the long and short positions have identical committee on uniform security identification procedures numbers cusips105indexvaluation techniques the fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2015 and 2014 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe specific valuation techniques utilized for the categorization of financial instruments presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition are described as followstrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries these instruments are recorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reflected in current period net incomewhen available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of our trading securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securitieswhen instruments are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotationsthe fair value for sba loan securitizations is determined by utilizing observable prices obtained from a third party pricing service the third party pricing service provides comparable price evaluations utilizing observable market data for similar securities we substantiate the prices obtained from the third party pricing service by comparing such prices for a sample of securities to observable market trades obtained from external sources the instruments valued using these observable inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyrj bank maintains a trading portfolio of certain corporate loans that it originates through the primary syndication market these trading instruments are recognized as of the trade date and are carried at fair value with the related unrealized and realized gains and losses reflected in net trading profit these trading instruments are valued using quotes from a third party pricing service these third party pricing service quotes are based on current market data provided by multiple dealers the instruments are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the market inputs utilized by the third party pricing service are based upon observable inputs we validate the third party pricing service quotes by comparing such prices to those provided by another external sourcepositions in illiquid securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy106indexio strip securities do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices accordingly we use valuation techniques that consider a number of factors including a the original cost of the pooled underlying sba loans from which the io strip securities were created and any changes from the original to the hypothetical cost of buying similar loans under current market conditions b seasoning of the underlying sba loans in the pool that back the io strip securities c the type and nature of the pooled sba loans backing the io strip securities d actual and assumed prepayment rates on the underlying pools of sba loans and e market data for past trades in comparable io strip securities prices from independent sources are used to corroborate our estimates of fair value our io strip securities are recorded in other securities within our trading instruments on our consolidated statements of financial condition these fair value measurements use significant unobservable inputs and accordingly we classify them as level 3 of the fair value hierarchyincluded within trading instruments or trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are to be announced tba security contracts with investors for generic mbs securities at specific rates and prices to be delivered on settlement dates in the future these tbas are entered into by rjampa as a component of a hedging strategy to hedge interest rate risk that it would otherwise be exposed to as part of a program its fixed income public finance operations offers to certain state and local housing finance agencies hfa under this program rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase government national mortgage association gnma or federal national home mortgage association fnma mbs the mbs securities are issued on behalf of various hfa clients and consist of the mortgages originated through their lending programs rjampas forward gnma or fnma mbs purchase commitments arise at the time of the loan reservation for a borrower in the hfa lending program these loan reservations fix the terms of the mortgage including the interest rate and maximum principal amount the underlying terms of the gnma or fnma mbs purchase including the price for the mbs security which is dependent upon the interest rates associated with the underlying mortgages are also fixed at loan reservation upon acquisition of the mbs security rjampa typically sells such security in open market transactions as part of its fixed income operations given that the actual principal amount of the mbs security is not fixed and determinable at the date of rjampas commitment to purchase these forward mbs purchase commitments do not meet the definition of a derivative instrument these tba securities are accounted for at fair value and are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy the tba securities may aggregate to either a net asset or net liability at any reporting date depending upon market conditions the offsetting purchase commitment is accounted for at fair value and is included in either other assets or other liabilities depending upon whether the tba securities aggregate to a net asset or net liability the fair value of the purchase commitment is classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy available for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities interest on the rjf afs securities is recognized in interest income on an accrual basis for the rj bank afs securities discounts are accreted and premiums are amortized as an adjustment to yield over the estimated average life of the security realized gains and losses on sales of any rjf afs securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldunrealized gains or losses on any rjf afs securities except for those that are deemed to be otherthantemporary are recorded through other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on our consolidated statements of financial conditionfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at a reporting period end we make an assessment whether such securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered in order to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the securitywe intend and have the ability to hold the rjf afs securities to maturity we have concluded that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these available for sale securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis those securities whose amortized cost basis we do not expect to recover in full are deemed to be otherthantemporarily impaired and 107indexare written down to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in shareholders equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security for any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidity expected principal and interest cash flows on the impaired debt security are discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the time of acquisition the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment otti recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securitythe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or for any securities traded in markets where the trading activity has slowed such as the cmo market the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were at one time able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple inputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyderivative contractswe enter into interest rate swaps futures contracts and forward foreign exchange contracts either as part of our fixed income business to facilitate client transactions to hedge a portion of our trading inventory or to a limited extent for our own account these derivatives are accounted for as trading account assets or liabilities and recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition any realized or unrealized gains or losses are recorded in net trading profits within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income with any interest earned thereon recorded in interest income the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted bycounterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of these interest rate derivative contracts is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelswe also facilitate matched book derivative transactions through nonbrokerdealer subsidiaries either raymond james financial products llc or raymond james capital services llc collectively referred to as the raymond james matched book 108indexswap subsidiaries or rjss the only difference in the swap businesses conducted by these two subsidiary entities is that they utilize different third party financial institutions to facilitate the offsetting transaction rjss enters into derivative transactions primarily interest rate swaps with clients for every derivative transaction rjss enters into with a client it enters into an offsetting transaction with terms that mirror the client transaction with a credit support provider who is a third party financial institution any collateral required to be exchanged under these derivative contracts is administered directly by the client and the third party financial institution rjss does not hold any collateral or administer any collateral transactions related to these instruments we record the value of each derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition fair value is determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position there is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments rjss recognizes revenue on derivative transactions on the transaction date computed as the present value of the expected cash flows rjss expects to receive from the third party financial institution over the life of the derivative contract the difference between the present value of these cash flows at the date of inception and the gross amount potentially received is accreted to revenue over the term of the contract the revenue from these transactions is included within other revenues on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income rj bank enters into threemonth forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cumulative translation adjustment component of aoci with such balance impacting earnings in the event the net investment is sold or substantially liquidated gains and losses on the undesignated derivative instruments as well as amounts representing hedge ineffectiveness are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at each reporting period using a method that is based on changes in forward rates the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the beginning balance of the foreign net investment at the inception of the hedging relationship and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the terms of the hedging instrument and hypothetical derivative match at inception there is no expected ineffectiveness to be recorded in earnings the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the forward exchange contracts is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrument the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy the cash flows associated with certain assets held by rj bank provide interest income at fixed interest rates therefore the value of these assets absent any risk mitigation is subject to fluctuation based upon changes in market rates of interest over time beginning in february 2015 we entered into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bankthe rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the effective portion of the related gain or loss is recorded net of tax in shareholders equity as part of the cash flow hedge component of aoci and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings specifically upon the incurrence of interest expense on certain borrowings the ineffective portions of the related gain and loss are immediately recognized into earnings in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income hedge effectiveness is assessed at inception and each reporting period utilizing regression analysis and performed using the hypothetical derivative method however as the key terms of the hedging instrument and hedged transaction match at inception management expects there to be no ineffectiveness impacting earnings from this hedge while it is outstanding as a result of these derivative transactions being executed through a clearing exchange the cash deposit associated with this transaction that we have provided to the exchange is included as a component of deposits with clearing organizations on our consolidated statements of financial condition the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models109indexprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments are held primarily in our other segment and consist of various direct and third party private equity investments employee investment

clients are primarily for accrued investment advisory fees both the receivables from the asset management and brokerdealer clients are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any allowance for doubtful accounts when a receivable held by one of our brokerdealer subsidiaries is considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value

customers including those that collateralize margin or other similar transactions 110indexare not reflected in our consolidated statements of financial condition see note 19 for additional information regarding this collateralwe offer loans to financial advisors and certain key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes these loans are generally repaid over a five to eight year period with interest recognized as earned there is no fee income associated with these loans we assess future recoverability of these loans through analysis of individual financial advisor production or other performance standards in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us any unpaid balance of such loan becomes immediately due and payable to us in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts related to former employees or independent contractors management primarily considers our historical collection experience as well as other factors including any amounts due at termination the reasons for the terminated relationship and the former financial advisors overall financial position when the review of these factors indicates that further collection activity is highly unlikely the outstanding balance of such loan is writtenoff and the corresponding allowance is reduced based upon the nature of these financing receivables we do not analyze this asset on a portfolio segment or class basis further the aging of this receivable balance is not a determinative factor in computing our allowance for doubtful accounts as concerns regarding the recoverability of these loans primarily arise in the event that the financial advisor is no longer affiliated with us we present the outstanding balance of loans to financial advisors on our consolidated statements of financial condition net of their applicable allowances for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts balance associated with all of our

market conditions for a new loan of similar risk made to another borrower in similar financial circumstances for those restructurings of first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage loans which may reflect current market conditions the concessions granted by rj bank are generally interest capitalization principal forbearance release of liability ordered under chapter 7 bankruptcy not reaffirmed by the borrower or an extension of the interestonly or maturity period the concessions granted in restructurings of corporate loans are similar to those for residential mortgage loans and may also include the reduction of the guarantors liability first mortgage and home equity residential mortgage tdrs may be returned to accrual status when there has been a sustained period of six months of satisfactory performance corporate tdrs have generally been partially chargedoff and therefore remain on nonaccrual status until the loan is fully resolvedimpaired loansloans in all classes are considered to be impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that rj bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest on a loan when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired rj bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a casebycase basis taking into consideration reasons for the delay the borrowers prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed for individual loans identified as impaired impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate and taking into consideration the factors described below in relation to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses except that as a practical expedient rj bank measures impairment based on the loans observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent impaired loans include all corporate nonaccrual loans all residential mortgage nonaccrual loans for which a chargeoff had previously been recorded and all loans which have been modified in tdrs interest income on impaired loans is recognized consistently with the recognition policy of nonaccrual loansallowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitmentsrj bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when rj bank believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed subsequent recoveries if any are credited to the allowance rj bank has developed policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of risk considering all available information in developing this assessment rj bank relies on estimates and exercises judgment in evaluating credit risk the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available depending on changes in circumstances future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results from the prior estimates which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan lossesthis allowance for loan loss is comprised of three components allowances calculated based on formulas for homogenous classes of loans collectively evaluated for impairment specific allowances assigned to certain classified loans individually evaluated for impairment and unallocated allowances resulting from our analysis of certain qualitative factors these homogeneous classes are a result of managements disaggregation of the loan portfolio and are comprised of the previously mentioned classes campi cre cre construction taxexempt residential first mortgage residential home equity and sbla quarterly analysis of the loss emergence period the average length of time in calendar quarters between discovery of the estimate of the loss event and confirmation of loss is performed on all defaulted loans in the corporate residential first mortgage and residential home equity loan classes where deemed necessary this analysis is utilized in establishing the allowance for each of these classes of loans through the application of an adjustment to the calculated allowance percentage for the respective loan grade the loans within the corporate loan classes are assigned to one of several internal loan grades based upon the respective loans credit characteristics the loans within the residential first mortgage residential home equity and sbl classes are assigned loan grades equivalent to the loan classifications utilized by bank regulators dependent on their respective likelihood of loss we assign each loan grade for all loan classes an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that grade the allowance for loan losses for all nonimpaired loans is then calculated based on the allowance percentage assigned to the respective loans 113indexclass and grade the allowance for loan losses for all impaired loans and those nonaccrual residential mortgage loans that have been evaluated for a chargeoff are based on an individual evaluation of impairment as previously described in the impaired loans sectionthe qualitative and quantitative factors taken into consideration when assigning the loan grades and allowance percentages to the loans within the corporate loan classes include estimates of borrower default probabilities and collateral values trends in delinquencies loan growth loan terms changes in geographic distribution updated loantovalue ltv ratios lending policies experience ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff local regional national and international economic conditions concentrations of credit risk past loss history shared national credit snc reviews and examination results from bank regulators loan grades for individual corporate loans are derived from analyzing two aspects of the risk factors in a particular loan the obligor rating and the facility collateral rating the obligor rating relates to a borrowers probability of default and the facility rating is utilized to estimate the anticipated loss given default these two ratings which are based on rj banks internal historical loss data or historical longterm industry loss rates where rj bank has limited loss history are considered in combination with certain management adjustments to derive the final corporate loan grades and allowance percentages for sbl residential first mortgage loan and residential home equity loan classes the qualitative factors considered when assigning allowance percentages include loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements whether the loan is originated or purchased borrower credit scores at origination occupancy ie owner occupied second home or investment property documentation level loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size and loan policy exceptions these qualitative factors while considered and reviewed in establishing the allowance for loan losses have generally not resulted in any quantitative adjustments to rj banks historical loss rates historical loss rates a quantitative factor are utilized when assigning the allowance percentages for residential first mortgage loans and residential home equity loans and are derived from estimates of the probability of default and loss given default severity these estimated loss rates are based on rj banks historical loss data as adjusted by management over a period of time prior to the quarter ended september 30 2015 the estimated loss rates were based on a twoyear period during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 this lookback period was revised to five years in order to encompass a full housing cycle in addition to historical loss rates one other quantitative factor utilized for the performing residential mortgage loan portfolio is updated ltv ratios rj bank segregates the performing loans in the residential loan classes on a quarterly basis based upon updated ltv data rj bank obtains the most recently available information generally on a quarterlag to estimate the current ltv ratios on the individual loans in the residential mortgage loan portfolio current ltvs are estimated on a loan by loan basis utilizing the initial appraisal obtained at the time of origination adjusted for housing price changes that have occurred since origination using current valuation indices the value of the homes could vary from actual market values due to changes in the condition of the underlying property variations in housing price changes within current valuation indices and other factors the product of the default and loss severity percentages is then applied to the balance of residential first mortgages and residential home equity loan balances which have been further stratified by updated ltv in order to calculate the related allowance for loan lossesas tdrs regardless of the loan portfolio segment or accrual status are impaired loans rj bank evaluates its credit risk on an individual loan basis the amount of impairment recorded on these loans is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate or if collateral dependent based on the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell in addition all redefaults 60 or more days delinquent subsequent to the loans modification date on tdrs are factored into each portfolio segments allowance for loan losses qualitative information such as geographic area and industry for tdrs and redefaulted tdrs is considered and reviewed in the determination of expected loss rates previously discussedrj bank reserves for losses inherent in its unfunded lending commitments using a methodology similar to that used for loans in the respective portfolio segment based upon loan grade and expected funding probabilities for fully binding commitments this will result in some reserve variability over different periods depending upon the mix of the loan portfolio at the time and future funding expectations all classes of impaired loans which have unfunded lending commitments are analyzed in conjunction with the impaired reserve process previously described loan chargeoff policiescorporate loans are monitored on an individual basis and loan grades are reviewed at least quarterly to ensure they reflect the loans current credit risk when rj bank determines that it is likely a corporate loan will not be collected in full the loan is evaluated for potential impairment after consideration of the borrowers ability to restructure the loan alternative sources of repayment and other factors affecting the borrowers ability to repay the debt the portion of the loan deemed to be a confirmed loss if any is chargedoff for collateraldependent loans secured by real estate the amount of the loan considered a confirmed loss and chargedoff is generally equal to the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the collaterals appraised value less estimated costs to sell in instances where the individual loan under evaluation is agented by another bank and where 114indexthe agent bank has not ordered a timely update of an outdated appraisal rj bank may make adjustments to previous appraised values for purposes of calculating specific reserves or taking partial chargeoffs these impaired loans are then considered to be in a workout status and we evaluate on an ongoing basis all factors relevant in determining the collectability and fair value of the loan appraisals on these impaired loans are obtained early in the impairment process as part of determining fair value and are updated as deemed necessary given the facts and circumstances of each individual situation certain factors such as guarantor recourse additional borrower cash contributions or stable operations will mitigate the need for more frequent than annual appraisals in its ongoing evaluation of each individual loan rj bank may consider more frequent appraisals in locations where commercial property values are known to be experiencing a greater amount of volatility for campi and taxexempt loans rj bank evaluates all sources of repayment including the estimated liquidation value of collateral to arrive at the amount considered to be a loss and chargedoff corporate banking and credit risk managers also hold a monthly meeting to review criticized loans loans that are rated special mention or worse as defined by bank regulators see note 9 for further discussion additional chargeoffs are taken when the value of the collateral changes or there is an adverse change in the expected cash flowsthe majority of rj banks corporate loan portfolio is comprised of participations in either sncs or other large syndicated loans in the us or canada the sncs are us loan syndications totaling over 20 million that are shared between three or more regulated institutions most snc loans are reviewed annually by the agent banks regulator a process in which the other participating banks have no involvement once the snc regulatory review process is complete rj bank receives a summary of the review of these snc credits from the office of the comptroller of the currency occ this summary includes a synopsis of each loans regulatory classification loans that are designated for nonaccrual status and directed chargeoffs rj bank must be at least as critical with nonaccrual designations directed chargeoffs and classifications as the occ this ensures that each bank participating in a snc loan rates the loan at least as critical any classification changes may impact rj banks reserves and chargeoffs during the quarter that the snc information is received from the occ however these differences in classifications are generally minimal given the size of the snc loan portfolio the amount of such adjustments depend upon the classification and whether rj bank had the loan classified differently either more or less critically than the snc review findings and therefore could result in higher lower or no change in loan loss provisions than previously recorded rj bank incorporates into its ratings process any observed regulatory trends in the annual snc exam process but there will inherently be differences of opinion on individual credits due to the high degree of judgment involved while the snc review has historically been an annual process regulators may increase the frequency of such examinations in the future with respect to its ongoing credit evaluation process of the snc portfolio rj bank conforms to what it believes will be the regulators view of individual credits corporate loans are subject to rj banks internal review procedures and regulatory review by the occ as part of rj banks regulatory examinationevery residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due is reviewed by rj bank personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status appraised value and other data points rj bank senior management meets monthly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoffwritedown recommendations on every residential mortgage loan over 60 days past due with chargeoffs considered on residential mortgage loans once the loans are delinquent 90 days or more and then generally taken before the loan is 120 days past due a chargeoff is taken against the allowance for loan losses for the difference between the loan amount and the amount that rj bank estimates will ultimately be collected based on the value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell rj bank predominantly uses broker price opinions bpo for these valuations as access to the property is restricted during the collection and foreclosure process and there is insufficient data available for a full appraisal to be performed bpos contain relevant and timely sale comparisons and listings in the marketplace and therefore we have found these bpos to be reasonable determinants of market value in lieu of appraisals and more reliable than an automated valuation tool or the use of tax assessed values a full appraisal is obtained postforeclosure rj bank takes further chargeoffs against the owned asset if an appraisal has a lower valuation than the original bpo but does not reverse previously chargedoff amounts if the appraisal is higher than the original bpo if a loan remains in preforeclosure status for more than nine months an updated valuation is obtained and further chargeoffs are taken against the allowance for loan losses if necessary other assets rj bank carries

intangible assets such as goodwill rather these assets are subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired however if the estimated fair value is below carrying value further analysis is required to determine the amount of the impairment this further analysis involves assigning tangible assets and liabilities identified intangible assets and goodwill to reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount in the course of our evaluation of the potential impairment of goodwill we may perform either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our qualitative assessment of potential impairment may result in the determination that a quantitative impairment analysis is not necessary under this elective process we assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount then performing a quantitative analysis is not required however if we conclude otherwise then we perform a quantitative impairment analysis 116indexif we either choose not to perform a qualitative assessment or we choose to perform a qualitative assessment but are unable to qualitatively conclude that no impairment has occurred then we perform a quantitative evaluation in the case of a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit which the goodwill that is subject to the quantitative analysis is associated generally defined as the businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management and compare it to the carrying value if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the excess we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date see note 13 for additional information regarding the outcome of our goodwill impairment assessmentslegal liabilitieswe recognize liabilities for contingencies when there is an exposure that when fully analyzed indicates it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated whether a loss is probable and if so the estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and uncertainties when a range of possible loss can be estimated we accrue the most likely amount within that range if the most likely amount of possible loss within that range is not determinable we accrue a minimum based on the range of possible loss no liability is recognized for those matters which in managements judgment the determination of a reasonable estimate of loss is not possible we record liabilities related to legal proceedings in trade and other payables on our consolidated statements of financial condition the determination of these liability amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management management considers many factors including but not limited to the amount of the claim the amount of the loss in the clients account the basis and validity of the claim the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of one of our employees or financial advisors previous results in similar cases and legal precedents and case law each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the liability balance is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management any change in the liability amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as either a charge or a credit to net income in that period the

namely limited partners or investor members and 2 the tax credit funds purpose and design including the risks that the tax credit fund was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest

to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the tax credit fund vie which could potentially be significant to the fundrjtcf sponsors two general types of nonguaranteed tax credit funds either nonguaranteed single investor funds or nonguaranteed multiinvestor funds in single investor funds rjtcf has concluded that the one single investor member or limited partner in such funds has significant participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund resulting in a conclusion of shared power with the limited partner therefore rjtcf as managing member or general partner of such funds is not the one party with power over such activities and resultantly is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such single investor funds and these funds are not consolidated in multiinvestor funds rjtcf has concluded that since the participating rights over the activities that most significantly impact the economics of the fund are not held by one single investor member or limited partner rjtcf is deemed to have the power over such activities rjtcf then assesses whether its projected benefits to be received from the multiinvestor funds primarily from ongoing asset management fees or its share of any residuals upon the termination of the fund are potentially significant to the fund rjtcf is deemed to be the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates any multiinvestor fund for which it concludes that such benefits are potentially significant to the fund among the lihtc fund entities evaluated rjtcf determined that some of the lihtc funds it sponsors are not vies these funds are either 1 funds which rjtcf holds a significant interest one of which typically holds interests in certain tax credit limited partnerships

sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in significant unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those unobservable inputs are described belowauction rate securitiesone of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of auction rate securities presented within our available for sale securities portfolio relates to judgments regarding whether the level of observable trading activity is sufficient to conclude markets are active where insufficient levels of trading activity are determined to exist as of the reporting date then managements assessment of how much weight to apply to trading prices in inactive markets versus managements own valuation models could significantly impact the valuation conclusion the valuation of the securities impacted by changes in managements assessment of market activity levels could be either higher or lower depending upon the relationship of the inactive trading prices compared to the outcome of managements internal valuation modelsthe future interest rate and maturity assumptions impacting the valuation of the auction rate securities are directly related as shortterm interest rates rise due to the variable nature of the penalty interest rate provisions embedded in most of these securities in the event auctions fail to set the securitys interest rate then a penalty rate that is specified in the security increases these penalty rates are based upon a stated interest rate spread over what is typically a shortterm base interest rate index management estimates that at some level of increase in shortterm interest rates issuers of the securities will have the economic incentive to refinance and thus prepay the securities therefore the shortterm interest rate assumption directly impacts the input related to the timing of any projected prepayment the faster and steeper shortterm interest rates rise the earlier prepayments will likely occur and the higher the fair value of the securityprivate equity investmentsthe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of private equity investments relate to the financial performance of the investment entity and the markets required return on investments from entities in industries in which we hold investments significant increases or decreases in our investment entities future economic performance will have a directly proportional impact on the valuation results the value of our investment moves inversely with the markets expectation of returns from such investments should the market require higher returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will decrease in value should the market accept lower returns from industries in which we are invested all other factors held constant our investments will increase in valuefair value optionthe fair value option is an accounting election that allows the reporting entity to apply fair value accounting for certain financial assets and liabilities on an instrument by instrument basis as of september 30 2015 and 2014 we have elected not to choose the fair value option for any of our financial assets

pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are recorded at amounts that approximate the fair value of these instruments these financial instruments generally expose us to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have shortterm maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market rates under the fair value hierarchy cash and cash equivalents and assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations and other segregated assets are classified as level 1 securities either purchased or sold under agreements to resell and other collateralized financings are classified as level 2 under the fair value hierarchy because they are generally variable rate instruments

held for sale are included in the nonrecurring fair value measurements in addition to any impaired loans held for investmentfair values for both variable and fixedrate loans held for investment are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality this methodology for estimating the fair value of loans does not consider other market variables and therefore is not based on an exit price concept refer to note 2 for information regarding the fair value policies specific to loans

adjustment due to a change in a tax election pertaining to whether assets acquired and liabilities assumed are writtenup to fair value for tax purposes this election is made on an entitybyentity basis and during the year indicated our assumption regarding whether we would make such election changed for one of the morgan keegan entities we acquired in the prior fiscal year the offsetting balance associated with this adjustment to goodwill was the net deferred tax asset2the impairment expense in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 is associated with the rjes reporting unit we concluded the goodwill associated with this reporting unit to be completely impaired during fiscal year 2013 since we did not own 100 of rjes as of the goodwill impairment testing date for the year ended september 30 2013 the effect of this impairment expense on the pretax income attributable to raymond james financial inc is approximately 46 million and the portion of the impairment expense attributable to the noncontrolling interests is approximately 23 million rjes is an entity that provides research coverage on european corporations as well as having sales and trading operations the decline in value of rjes as of december 31 2012 was primarily due to the economic slowdown experienced in europe at that time which was having a negative impact on the financial services entities operating therein as well as certain management decisions that were made during the quarter ended march 31 2013 which impacted rjes operating plans on a going forward basis in april 2013 we purchased all of the outstanding equity in rjes that was held by others thus we now have sole control over rjes there was no goodwill impairment in any other reporting unit in fiscal year 2013 3the addition in fiscal year 2015 is directly attributable to the acquisition of tpc see notes 1 and 3 for additional informationas described in note 2 goodwill is subject to an evaluation of potential impairment on an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended march 31 2015 evaluating the balances as of december 31 2014 we performed a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any reporting unit as of december 31 2014 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of our reporting units as of december 31 2014 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2014 that would cause us to update our latest annual impairment testingin fiscal year 2014 we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing during the quarter ended march 31 2014 evaluating the balances as of december 31 2013 similar to fiscal year 2015 we performed a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that includes an allocation of goodwill based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessment we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair

financial instruments with offbalance sheet riskin the normal course of business we purchase and sell securities as either principal or agent on behalf of our clients if either the client or counterparty fails to perform we may be required to discharge the obligations of the nonperforming party in such circumstances we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security or futures contract is different from the contract value of the transactionin a number of instances in the discussions that follow reference is made to collateral note 19 provides additional information regarding the recorded balances in the consolidated statements of financial condition and the collateral balances related thereto we also act as an intermediary between brokerdealers and other financial institutions whereby we borrow securities from one brokerdealer and then lend them to another securities borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amounts of cash 183indexcollateral advanced and received in connection with the transactions we measure the market value of the securities borrowed and loaned against the cash collateral on a daily basis the market value of securities borrowed was 834 million and securities loaned was 397 million at september 30 2015 and the market value of securities borrowed was 1133 million and securities loaned was 61 million at september 30 2014 the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 863 million and 444 million respectively at september 30 2015 and the contract value of securities borrowed and securities loaned was 1177 million and 673 million respectively at september 30 2014 additional cash is obtained as necessary to ensure such transactions are adequately collateralized if another party to the transaction fails to perform as agreed for example failure to deliver a security or failure to pay for a security we may incur a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract amount of the transactionwe have also loaned to brokerdealers and other financial institutions securities owned by clients and others for which we have received cash or other collateral the market value of securities loaned was 4326 million and 3412 million at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively the contract value of securities loaned was 4342 million and 350 million at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively if a borrowing institution or brokerdealer does not return a security we may be obligated to purchase the security in order to return it to the owner in such circumstances we may incur a loss equal to the amount by which the market value of the security on the date of nonperformance exceeds the value of the collateral received from the financial institution or the brokerdealer we have sold securities that we do not currently own and will therefore be obligated to purchase such securities at a future date we have recorded 288 million and 2384 million at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively which represents the market value of such securities see notes 5 and 6 for further information we are subject to loss if the market price of those securities not covered by a hedged position increases subsequent to fiscal yearend we utilize short positions on government obligations and equity securities to economically hedge long inventory positionswe enter into security transactions on behalf of our clients and other brokers involving forward settlement forward contracts provide for the delayed delivery of the underlying instrument the contractual amounts related to these financial instruments reflect the volume and activity and do not reflect the amounts at risk the gain or loss on these transactions is recognized on a trade date basis transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument our exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors including the duration size composition and diversification of positions held the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and market volatility the credit risk for these transactions is limited to the unrealized market valuation gains recorded in the consolidated statements of financial conditionthe majority of our transactions and consequently the concentration of our credit exposure is with clients brokerdealers and other financial institutions in the us these activities primarily involve collateralized arrangements and may result in credit exposure in the event that the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations our exposure to credit risk can be directly impacted by volatile securities markets which may impair the ability of counterparties to satisfy their contractual obligations we seek to control our credit risk through a variety of reporting and control procedures including establishing credit limits based upon a review of the counterparties financial condition and credit ratings we monitor collateral levels on a daily basis for compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines and request changes in collateral levels as appropriate as a part of our fixed income public finance operations rjampa enters into forward commitments to purchase gnma or fnma mbs see note 2 and note 21 for information on these commitments we utilize tba security contracts to hedge our interest rate risk associated with these commitments we are subject to loss if the timing of or the actual amount of the mbs securities differs significantly from the term and notional amount of the tba security contracts we enter into rj ltd is subject to foreign exchange risk primarily due to financial instruments denominated in us dollars that may be impacted by fluctuation in foreign exchange rates in order to mitigate this risk rj ltd enters into forward foreign exchange contracts the fair value of these contracts is not significant as of september 30 2015 forward contracts outstanding to buy and sell us dollars totaled cdn 22 million and cdn 169 million respectively rj bank is also subject to foreign exchange risk related to its net investment in a canadian subsidiary see note 18 for information regarding how rj bank utilizes net investment hedges to mitigate a portion of this riskrj bank has outstanding at any time a significant number of commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments such as standby letters of credit and loan purchases which then extend over varying periods of time these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments and each customers credit worthiness is evaluated on a casebycase basis fixedrate commitments are also subject to market risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and rj banks exposure is limited to the replacement value of those commitments 184indexrj banks commitments to extend credit and other creditrelated offbalance sheet financial instruments outstanding are as follows as of september 30 2015 2014 in thousandsstandby letters of credit60925 100582open end consumer lines of credit primarily sbl2531690 1585717commercial lines of credit1419746 1692896unfunded loan commitments322419 248931in the normal course of business rj bank issues or participates in the issuance of financial standby letters of credit whereby it provides an irrevocable guarantee of payment in the event the letter of credit is drawn down by the beneficiary these standby letters of credit generally expire in one year or less as of september 30 2015 609 million of such letters of credit were outstanding in the event that a letter of credit is drawn down rj bank would pursue repayment from the party under the existing borrowing relationship or would liquidate collateral or both the proceeds from repayment or liquidation of collateral are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn down under the existing letters of credit the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved with extending loan commitments to clients and accordingly rj bank uses a credit evaluation process and collateral requirements similar to those for loan commitmentsopen end consumer lines of credit primarily represent the unfunded amounts of rj bank loans to customers that are secured by marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards the proceeds from repayment or if necessary the liquidation of collateral which is monitored daily are expected to satisfy the amounts drawn against these existing lines of creditbecause many of rj banks lending commitments expire without being funded in whole or part the contract amounts are not estimates of rj banks actual future credit exposure or future liquidity requirements rj bank maintains a reserve to provide for potential losses related to the unfunded lending commitments see note 9 for further discussion of this reserve for unfunded lending commitments credit risk represents the accounting loss that would be recognized at the reporting date if counterparties failed completely to perform as contracted the credit risk amounts are equal to the contractual amounts assuming that the amounts are fully advanced and that the collateral or other security is of no value rj bank uses the same credit approval and monitoring process in extending loan commitments and other creditrelated offbalance sheet instruments as it does in making loans185indexnote 28  earnings per sharethe following
