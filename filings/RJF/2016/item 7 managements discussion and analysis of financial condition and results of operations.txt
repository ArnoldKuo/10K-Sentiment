highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets the corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions interest rates economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants which include investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of public offerings investment banking activity trading profits interest rate volatility and asset valuations or a combination thereof in turn these decisions and factors affect our business resultsyear ended september 30 2016 compared with the year ended september 30 2015  we achieved net revenues of 54 billion a 203 million or 4 increase over the prior year our net income of 529 million reflects an increase of 27 million or 5 and our diluted earnings per share for the current year amount to 365 a 6 increase the current year diluted earnings per share benefited from our repurchase of common stock in open market transactions total client assets under administration increased to 6044 billion at september 30 2016 a 26 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to our acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs strong financial advisor recruiting results high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors and an increase in u s equity markets over the yearafter excluding the acquisitionrelated expenses we incurred during the current year our nongaap adjusted net income amounts to 556 million1 an increase of 11 over the prior year nongaap adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts to 3841 an increase of 12 over the 343 diluted earnings per share in the prior yearnet revenues increased in each of our four operating segments our nonoperating other segment reflects a decline in net revenues as the prior year experienced higher valuation gains from our private equity investments than the current year as well as realized gains on sales of ars noninterest expenses have increased 202 million or 5 the increase primarily results from increases in compensation commissions and benefits due to annual raises growth in related commission and fee revenues and increases in benefits expenses increases in communications and information processing expenses resulting from our continued investment in our pcg platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems an increase in the bank loan loss provision resulting from loan growth and an increase associated with the credit deterioration of certain loans in the energy sector and increases in other expenses predominately due to increases in certain legal and regulatory expensesa summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results as compared to the prior year are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues of 362 billion a 3 increase while pretax income decreased by 2 million to 341 million the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to an increase in account and service fee income most notably an increase in fees associated with our multibank client cash sweep program resulting from both an increase in shortterm interest rates and an increase in client cash balances resulting from clients reaction to market volatility and uncertainty securities commissions and fee revenues increased 1 overall fees arising from feebased accounts as well as commissions on fixed income products increased substantially more than offsetting declines in commissions on mutual funds equity securities and new issue sales credits noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior year level most significantly due to higher administrative expenses to support our continued growth higher communications and information technology expenses resulting from our continued investments in our platform and in improving our compliance and regulatory systems and an increase in other expense predominately due to certain legal and regulatory expenses the segments margin on net revenues decreased to 94 from 98 1adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are each nongaap financial measures please see the reconciliation of the gaap measures to the nongaap measures in this item 7 for a reconciliation of our nongaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures35indexthe capital markets segment generated net revenues of 1 billion a 4 increase while pretax income increased 32 million or 30 to 139 million the increase in revenues is driven by an increase in trading profits sales commissions on fixed income products and to a lesser extent an increase in tax credit fund syndication fee revenues offset by declines in equity underwriting fee and merger and acquisition and advisory fee revenues noninterest expenses increased a modest 1 over the prior year level our asset management segment generated net revenues of 404 million a 3 increase while pretax income decreased 3 million or 2 to 132 million nondiscretionary assetbased administration fee revenues increased driven by an increase in assets held in these programs over the prior year level advisory fee revenues from managed programs approximate the prior year despite the increase in balances of financial assets under management in managed programs as of fiscal year end due to the volatility of markets during the year and the timing of our fee computations expenses have increased 6 over the prior year level due in large part to a prior year reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year which did not recur in the current yearrj bank generated net revenues of 494 million a 19 increase while pretax income increased 59 million or 21 to 337 million the loan loss provision increased nearly 5 million or 20 over the prior year level due to higher corporate loan growth charges during the current year resulting from loans outstanding within the energy sector and additional provision for corporate loan downgrades noninterest expenses excluding provision for loan losses increased 16 million or 15 primarily due to an increase in the affiliate deposit account servicing fees paid to the private client group resulting from an increase in balances and an increase in fdic insurance premiumsactivities in our other segment reflect a pretax loss that is 84 million or 129 more than the prior year total revenues in the segment decreased 21 million or 31 primarily resulting from a decrease in private equity valuation gains and a decrease of 11 million in gains on the sale of certain ars securities resulting from prior year sales that did not recur in the current year offset by increased interest revenue and foreign exchange gains acquisitionrelated expenses of 41 million are reflected in this segment which did not occur in the prior year these expenses result from our incremental acquisitionrelated expenses for our acquisitions of alex brown 3macs and mummertour effective tax rate was 339 in fiscal year 2016 down from the 371 in the prior year the reduction in our effective tax rate compared to the prior year was due to the following factors 1 as a result of the fiscal year 2016 increase in equity market values compared to fiscal year 2015 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses arising from the value of our companyowned life insurance portfolio had the effect of decreasing our effective tax rate by 15 compared to the prior year 2 adjustments associated with planned divestitures of our remaining businesses in south america accounted for an effective rate decrease of 11 3 we settled significant state tax audits during the year which reduced our effective rate by 04 and 4 we were able to generate and utilize additional lowincome housing tax credits to apply against our tax liability which had a favorable 05 impact on our effective tax ratewe repurchased approximately 32 million shares of our common stock in open market transactions during the year for a total purchase price of approximately 1445 million reflecting an average per share repurchase price of 4569 see part ii item 5 in this report for additional information on these share repurchases the current year diluted earnings per share benefited by 005 as a result of these repurchases consistent with our growth strategies we completed three acquisitions during the year  alex brown 3macs and mummert we continue to evaluate future opportunities but remain committed to our strategy that acquisitions must meet our strategic growth objectives involve entities that share our culture of conservatism and clientfirst values and be executed at purchase prices that provide us opportunities to increase our shareholders valuethe number and significance of possible regulatory changes that impact the businesses in which we operate continues to grow and evolve in april 2016 the dol issued its final regulation expanding the definition of who is deemed an investment advice fiduciary under erisa as a result of giving investment advice to a plan plan participant or beneficiary as well as under the internal revenue code for individual retirement accounts and nonerisa plans refer to the fiduciary duty standard section of item 1 regulation in this report for further discussion of the regulation its effective dates and its potential impactyear ended september 30 2015 compared with the year ended september 30 2014we achieved net revenues of 52 billion in fiscal year 2015 a 339 million or 7 increase compared to the prior year all four operating segments achieved net revenue increases total client assets under administration increased to 480 billion at september 30 2015 a 1 increase over the prior year level the increase in assets under administration is attributable to strong 36indexfinancial advisor recruiting results and high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors which more than offset the decline in the us equity markets for the year primarily occurring in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2015we achieved net income in fiscal year 2015 of 502 million an increase of 22 million or 5 compared to the prior year three of our four operating segments achieved increased profitability in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level fully diluted earnings per share of 343 increased 011 or 3 over the prior year amount noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 278 million or 7 compared to the prior year the increase is primarily due to the increase in compensation commissions and benefits expenses associated with the increased revenues in addition as a result of various growth strategies across our businesses in fiscal year 2015 we experienced an increase in our business development expenses our strategic efforts during fiscal year 2015 to continually improve the technology available to our financial advisors as well as the additional costs of compliance with various new rules and regulations impacting our industry are factors impacting an increase in our communications and information processing expenses the provision for loan losses increased significantly in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year as fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the combination of the above noted factors even after consideration of the incremental expenses resulting from activities associated with the strategic growth initiatives that should favorably impact future revenues resulted in a pretax margin on net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 153 a level that is nearly equivalent to the 154 pretax margin on net revenues in the prior yeara summary of the most significant items impacting our financial results in fiscal 2015 as compared to the fiscal year 2014 are as followsour private client group segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 35 billion a 228 million or 7 increase over the prior year pretax income amounted to 342 million a 12 million or 4 increase over the prior year the increase in revenues in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased securities commissions and fee revenues predominately arising from feebased accounts as well as an increase in mutual fund and annuity service fee revenues client assets under administration of the private client group increased 1 over the prior year level to 4533 billion at september 30 2015 the increase in fiscal year 2015 commission revenues and client assets have resulted primarily from successful recruiting of financial advisors and high levels of financial advisor retention financial advisor recruiting in fiscal year 2015 was strong with a net increase of 331 financial advisors over the year to 6596 affiliated financial advisors as of september 30 2015 there was an overall net increase in client assets despite the impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions commission expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased in proportion to the increase in commission revenues while all other components of noninterest expense increased 5 as we incurred increases in certain costs associated with the successful recruiting efforts and continued information system improvements on july 31 2015 we completed our acquisition of the producers choice llc tpc a private insurance and annuity marketing organization based in troy michigan our acquisition of tpc brings more life insurance and annuity experts to the firm to support financial advisors and their clientsthe capital markets segment generated fiscal year 2015 net revenues of 960 million a 7 million or 1 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 107 million a decrease of 24 million or 18 compared to the prior year fiscal year 2015 reflected increases over the prior year in merger and acquisition fees and tax credit fund syndication fees commission revenues from fixed income institutional sales increased in fiscal year 2015 over the prior year level resulting in part from growth in our public finance activities however equity underwriting revenues declined compared to the prior year as a result of weakness in both the energy and real estate sectors which also led to a decline in commission revenues on equity products in fiscal year 2015 the net profit generated by this segment in fiscal year 2015 was negatively impacted by increased costs some of which result from our efforts during the year to broadly build out certain sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in certain sectors which we believe present solid longterm opportunities for future revenue growth the continued difficult market environment in canada in fiscal year 2015 negatively impacted this segments revenues and profitabilityour asset management segment generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 392 million a 23 million or 6 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 135 million a 7 million or 5 increase over the prior year financial assets under management increased 1 from the prior year to 652 billion as of september 30 2015 the increase resulted from net inflows of client assets which more than offset the unfavorable impact of the decline in the market value of assets that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 as a result of declining equity market conditions on april 30 2015 we completed our acquisition of cougar global investments limited cougar an asset 37indexmanagement firm based in toronto canada that markets its investment services to high net worth individuals families foundations trusts and institutions in canada and the united statesrj bank generated net revenues in fiscal year 2015 of 414 million a 63 million or 18 increase over the prior year pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was 279 million a 36 million or 15 increase over the prior year net interest income increased due to growth in average loans outstanding coupled with a modest increase in net interest margin in fiscal year 2015 our provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 increased 10 million or 74 compared to the prior year we incurred substantial provision for loan losses associated with loan growth in both years however the majority of the yearoveryear increase resulted from the prior year benefiting to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio the credit characteristics of the loan portfolio generally improved over the year reflecting the positive impact of improved economic conditions activities in our other segment in fiscal year 2015 resulted in a pretax loss that was 19 million less than the prior year net revenues in this segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 25 million resulting from increases in revenues associated with our private equity portfolio investments and an increase in gains resulting from our auction rate securities portfolio sales and redemption activities as a result of the fiscal year 2015 increase in private equity investment revenues the portion of this segments pretax income that is attributable to noncontrolling interests also increasedour fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate was 371 up from the 358 in the prior year as a result of the fiscal year 2015 decline in equity market values compared to positive markets in fiscal year 2014 the change in the amount of our nontaxable gainslosses arising from the value of our companyowned life insurance portfolio had the effect of increasing our effective tax rate by 12 compared to the prior year effective tax rate38indexsegmentsthe following

aid in and enhance the understanding of our financial results we believe that the nongaap measures provide useful information by excluding certain material items that may not be indicative of our core operating results we believe that these nongaap measures will allow for better evaluation of the operating performance of the business and facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results in the current year to those in prior and future years the nongaap financial information should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance

shortterm interest rates are likely to have a meaningful impact on our overall financial performance as we have certain assets and liabilities primarily held in our pcg and rj bank segments which are subject to changes in interest rates based on the current level of shortterm interest rates gradual increases in shortterm interest rates would have the most significant favorable impact on our pcg and rj bank segments refer to the table in item 7a  interest rate risk in this report which presents an analysis of rj banks estimated net interest income over a twelve month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates using the assetliability model applied by rj bankthe closing of the alex brown acquisition occurred late in fiscal year 2016 therefore we expect that our average interestearning assets will increase substantially in fiscal year 2017 over the average fiscal year 2016 levels the substantial client cash and margin balances associated with the alex brown division client accounts should have a favorable impact on our net interest earningsin december 2015 the federal reserve bank announced an increase in its benchmark shortterm interest rate by 25 basis points we estimate that this increase had a favorable impact on our pretax income of an amount approximating 60 million in fiscal year 2016 reflecting approximately 80 million of additional pretax income on an annualized basis our latest projection of the impact of additional increases by the federal reserve bank in its benchmark shortterm interest rate which is based upon september 30 2016 balances projects that an additional 25 basis point rise would result in an additional increase in our annual pretax income in a range of approximately 48 million to 60 million over a twelve month period the realization of such amounts is dependent upon the realization of certain key assumptions in our analysis such assumptions include our estimates of the timing and amounts of earningsdeposit rates paid on our clients cash balances client cash balance levels the level of earning assets and rj banks net interest margin in our analysis we assume that between 40 and 50 of such rate increase would also be reflected as a rate increase on earningdeposits paid on our clients cash balances we anticipate that a majority of any future increases would be reflected in account and service fee revenues resulting from an increase in the fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks and the discontinuance of money market fund fee waivers which are reported in the pcg segment and the remaining portion of the increase would be reflected in net interest income reported primarily in our pcg and rj bank segments if the federal reserve bank was to reverse its december 2015 action and decrease the benchmark shortterm interest rate the impact on our net interest income would be an unfavorable reversal of the positive impact described above

total pcg client assets under administration which include assets in feebased accounts and the overall us equities markets rjampa advisors operate under the rjampa registered investment advisor ria

significant accounting policies in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for our accounting policies on presenting these revenues in our consolidated financial statements net interest revenue in the private client group is generated by client balances predominantly the earnings on margin loans and assets segregated pursuant to regulations less interest paid on client cash balances the client interest program we also utilize a multibank sweep program which generates fee revenue from unaffiliated banks in lieu of interest revenue the cash sweep program known as the raymond james bank deposit program rjbdp is a multibank rj bank and many nonaffiliated banks program under which clients cash deposits in their brokerage accounts are redeposited into interestbearing deposit accounts up to 250000 per bank for individual accounts and up to 500000 per bank for joint accounts at various third party banks this program enables clients to obtain up to 25 million in individual fdic deposit insurance coverage 5 million for joint accounts while earning competitive rates on their cash balances clients transactions in securities are affected on either a cash or margin basis margin loans to clients are collateralized by the securities purchased or by other securities owned by the client interest is charged to clients on the amount borrowed the interest rate charged to a client on a margin loan is based on current interest rates and on the outstanding amount of the loantypically brokerdealers utilize bank borrowings and equity capital as the primary sources of funds to finance clients margin account borrowings rjampas source of funds to finance clients margin account balances has been cash balances in brokerage clients accounts which are funds awaiting investment in addition pursuant to written agreements with clients brokerdealers are permitted by the sec and finra rules to lend client securities in margin accounts to other financial institutions sec regulations however restrict the use of clients funds derived from pledging and lending clients securities as well as funds awaiting investment to the financing of margin account balances to the extent not so used such funds are required to be deposited in a special segregated account for the benefit of clients the regulations also require brokerdealers within designated

assets in feebased accounts2310 29 1794 7 1677total pcg assets under administration increased 27 over september 30 2015 the increase results from net client inflows attributable to strong financial advisor recruiting results high levels of retention of our existing financial advisors our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs which resulted in a combined 50 billion of client asset inflows as of their respective acquisition closing dates and an increase in u s equity markets at september 30 2016 compared to the prior year total pcg assets in feebased accounts increased 29 compared to september 30 2015 increased client assets under administration typically result in higher feebased account revenues and mutual fund and annuity service fees in periods where equity markets improve assets under administration increase and client activity generally increases thereby having a favorable impact on financial advisor productivity generally assets under administration client activity and financial advisor productivity decline in periods where equity markets reflect downward trends higher client cash balances generally lead to increased interest income and account fee

advisors as of september 30 2016 reflects a net increase of 550 individuals or an 8 net increase over the number of financial advisors as of september 30 2015 the net increase results from strong financial advisor recruiting and high levels of retention throughout fiscal year 2016 as well as the addition of 265 financial advisors as a result of our acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs importantly the client asset levels and productivity measures associated with those financial advisors recruited during the fiscal year exceed our historical benchmark averages notwithstanding the future impact of changes in the overall economy and more specifically their impact on future equity markets and fixed income markets factors over which we have no control we believe that this increase in productive financial advisors is a positive indication of potential future revenue growth in this segmentyear ended september 30 2016 compared with the year ended september 30 2015  private client groupnet revenues increased 109 million or 3 to 362 billion pretax income decreased 2 million to 341 million pcgs pretax margin on net revenues decreased to 94 as compared to the prior years 98 the 3macs and alex brown acquisitions were completed late in the fiscal year and therefore the impact of these acquisitions on this segments operations were not significant to our fiscal year 2016 resultssecurities commissions and fees increased 42 million or 1 revenues earned on feebased accounts increased 116 million or 8 commissions earned on fixed income products increased 21 million or 29 and commission revenues on insurance and annuity products increased 14 million or 4 offsetting these increases commissions on mutual funds decreased 49 million or 7 new issue sales credits declined 31 million or 41 and commissions on equity products decreased 30 million or 11 all of which reflect the challenging equity market conditions during significant portions of the current year total account and service fees increased 62 million or 14 client account and service fees increased 54 million or 31 primarily due to an increase in rjbdp fees resulting from increased average balances in the program as well as the december 2015 increase in interest rates mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 6 million or 2 primarily as a result of an increase in money market processing fees and omnibus fees arising from increased client assets and positions which are paid to us by companies whose products we distribute omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios and compensate us for recordkeeping total segment revenues increased 3 the portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 77 at september 30 2016 an increase from 75 at september 30 2015 recurring commission and fee revenues include assetbased fees trailing commissions from mutual funds and variable annuitiesinsurance products mutual fund and annuity service fees fees earned on funds in our multibank sweep program and interest assets in feebased accounts in fiscal year 2016 increased by a percentage greater than the percentage increases for total pcg client assets as clients continue to elect feebased alternatives versus traditional transactionbased accounts at september 30 2016 such assets were 2310 billion an increase of 29 compared to the 1794 billion as of september 30 2015net interest income in the pcg segment increased 8 million or 9 average customer cash balances and the related segregated asset balances increased compared to the prior year as many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets during portions of the current year by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts the december 2015 federal reserve bank shortterm interest rate increase further increased the net interest earned on these segregated asset balances in addition both the average interest rate and the average client margin balances outstanding increased noninterest expenses increased 110 million or 3 administrative and incentive compensation and benefits expense increased 43 million or 8 resulting in part from annual increases in salaries increases in employee benefit plan costs and additional staffing levels primarily in pcg operations and information technology functions to support our continuing growth clearance and other expense increased 35 million or 49 primarily resulting from increases in other expense related to certain legal and regulatory expenses which are approximately 40 million higher than the prior year level sales commission expense increased 23 million or 1 which is consistent with the 1 increase in securities commissions and fees revenues communications and information processing expense increased 9 million or 6 due to increases in software consulting and other information technology expenses associated with our continued investment in our platform and improving our compliance and regulatory systems year ended september 30 2015 compared with the year ended september 30 2014  private client groupnet revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 228 million or 7 to 35 billion while pretax income increased 12 million or 4 to 342 million pcgs pretax margin on net revenues decreased slightly to 98 as compared to 101 in fiscal year 2014 46indexsecurities commissions and fees in fiscal year 2015 increased 178 million or 6 client assets under administration increased to 4533 billion an increase of 27 billion or 1 compared to september 30 2014 the year over year increase in client assets in fiscal year 2015 was driven by positive net inflows generated by financial advisor retention and recruiting results as the equity markets in the us were down compared to the prior year the most significant increase in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arose from revenues earned on feebased accounts which increased 212 million or 17 and was partially offset by a 27 million or 9 decrease in commissions on equity products a 13 million or 15 decrease in new issue sales credits due to a decrease in equity underwritings and a 4 million or 5 decrease in commissions on fixed income products fiscal year 2015 includes a 7 million decrease in mutual fund commission revenues due to the resolution of a mutual fund share class issue that resulted in refunds of commissions being paid during the year to certain of our clients despite this unusual item mutual fund commission revenues still increased 2 million compared to fiscal year 2014 commission revenues on equity products have decreased in our canadian brokerdealer subsidiary as a result of the weaker canadian currency compared to the us dollar as well as the overall challenging canadian market conditions that existed throughout fiscal year 2015 commission earnings on fixed income products in fiscal year 2015 decreased primarily due to the continuation of historically low interest rates which continue to result in challenging fixed income market conditions total account and service fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 52 million or 13 mutual fund and annuity service fees increased 37 million or 17 primarily as a result of an increase in education and marketing support ems fees which include notransactionfee ntf program revenues and mutual fund omnibus fees all of which are paid to us by the mutual fund companies whose products we distribute during fiscal year 2014 we implemented technology changes in our ems program and standardized tiered service levels provided to many mutual fund companies resulting in increased fees earned from ems arrangements omnibus fees are generally based on the number of positions held in our client portfolios increases in such revenues are a result of increases in the number of positions for existing fund families on the omnibus platform as well as new fund families joining the omnibus program during fiscal year 2015 client account and service fees in fiscal year 2015 increased 14 million or 9 as a result of the changes made in many of our fee schedules implemented since december 2013 in addition transaction handling fees in feebased accounts increased due to the increased number of transactions fees generated in lieu of interest income from our multibank sweep program with unaffiliated banks increased due to higher average balances in the program and sbl affiliate servicing fees increased refer to the rj bank results of operations in this report for additional information on sbl activities as sbl balances have continued to grow in fiscal year 2015pcg net interest is relatively unchanged in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 net interest income arising from our brokerdealer margin lending activities in fiscal year 2015 decreased slightly compared to the fiscal year 2014 level a slight decline in margin interest rates more than offset the impact of slightly higher average margin loan balances outstanding the rate of growth in margin loan balances in fiscal year 2015 has been negatively impacted by the popularity of our sbl product offered by rj bank as a result of the extremely low rate interest rate environment that existed during fiscal year 2015 and the related low net interest spreads earned there was only a nominal impact on our net interest revenues resulting from changes in client cash balances total segment revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 7 the portion of total segment revenues that we consider to be recurring is approximately 75 at september 30 2015 an increase from 72 at september 30 2014 assets in feebased accounts in fiscal year 2015 increased more than average pcg client assets as clients continue to elect feebased alternatives versus traditional transactionbased

sales commission expense increased 167 million or 8 largely consistent with the 6 increase in commission and fee revenues coupled with increased hiring bonuses resulting from the high level of recruiting activity in fiscal year 2015 administrative and incentive compensation and benefits expense in fiscal year 2015 increased 34 million or 7 in part from annual increases in salary expenses increases in employee benefit plan costs and additional staffing levels primarily in information technology functions to support our continuing growth business development expenses increased 12

activities and the syndication and related management of investment partnerships designed to yield returns in the form of lowincome housing tax credits to institutions we provide securities brokerage

institutional fixed income commissions increased 32 million or 11 benefiting from increased activity during the year both in the anticipation of and the aftermath resulting from the eventual december 2015 federal reserve bank action to increase shortterm interest rates as well as the interest rate volatility in the markets during much of the fiscal year offsetting this increase institutional equity sales commissions decreased 19 million or 8 resulting primarily from decreased equity underwriting activities throughout most of fiscal year 2016 underwriting revenues decreased by 20 million or 27 while merger and acquisition and advisory fees decreased 14 million or 8 the late september 2015 decline in the equity markets coupled with market uncertainty in advance of the december 2015 federal reserve bank announcement and their related commentary on interest rates combined to result in an unfavorable market environment for equity activities during much of the fiscal year as a result we experienced lower volumes in both our merger and acquisition advisory and underwriting activities throughout most of fiscal year 2016 while merger and acquisition and advisory fees are a volatile revenue source in general the number of merger and acquisition transactions in fiscal year 2016 and especially in the first three months of the fiscal year was particularly low most of the decrease in our equity underwriting revenues results from our domestic operations revenues from our canadian activities were relatively unchanged from the low amount generated in the prior year the number of both leadmanaged and comanaged underwritings in both our domestic and canadian operations decreased during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 we experienced solid performance in our public finance underwritings in the current year which positively impacted both our securities commissions and fee revenues and our investment banking revenues the combined revenues resulting from these public finance business activities increased 1 over the prior year leveltax credit fund syndication fee revenues increased 15 million or 33 due to an increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership interests sold during the current year as a market leader amongst syndicators of lowincome housing tax credit fund lihtc investments we achieved a new milestone in fiscal year 2016 by selling over 1 billion of such investments to institutional investors additionally we were able to recognize nearly 7 million in revenues that were associated with partnership interests sold in prior years which had been deferred in those years current year recognition of these previously deferred revenues results from the favorable resolution of certain conditions associated with the partnership interests as of september 30 2016 approximately 11 million of previously deferred revenues remain to be recognized in future revenues whenever such conditions for revenue recognition are fully satisfied our net trading profit increased 33 million or 60 trading profits generated in our fixed income operations increased approximately 27 million reflecting solid results in most product categories within our equity capital markets operations the prior year included 5 million of realized trading losses attributable to an equity underwriting position held in our canadian subsidiary that did not recur in the current yearother revenues increased 11 million or 68 these revenues include 5 million arising from revenues associated with our annual analyst best picks foreign exchange

decreased equity underwriting activities throughout fiscal year 2015 particularly in the energy and real estate sectors merger and acquisitions and advisory fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased 11 million or 7 reaching 162 million we experienced significant increases in these revenues in fiscal year 2015 arising from our us operations led by our technology services sector and reflecting the benefit of prior years investments in other business sectors the portion of these revenues arising from our canadian operations decreased significantly due to the difficult canadian equity market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 especially in the natural resources sector our net trading profits in fiscal year 2015 decreased 5 million or 8 typically our trading profits are generated primarily from fixed income securities however in fiscal year 2015 the primary reason for the decrease is 5 million of realized trading losses arising in our canadian operations primarily attributable to a loss on an equity underwriting position despite the continuation of the challenging fixed income market conditions throughout fiscal year 2015 fixed income trading results were solid and steady throughout the year assisted by the trading profits generated on gnma and fnma mbs underwriting fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 decreased 26 million or 26 equity underwriting activities related to both initial public offerings and followon offerings declined significantly in the fiscal year the market sectors that historically represent our areas of strength had relatively lower activity levels during fiscal year 2015 we experienced growth in our public finance underwritings in fiscal year 2015 with a 63 increase in the par value of lead managed new issues compared to the prior year this increase favorably impacts both our securities commissions and fees revenues and our investment banking revenues the combined revenues resulting from our public finance business activities in fiscal year 2015 increased 11 million or 17tax credit fund syndication fee revenues in fiscal year 2015 increased by 10 million or 29 due to a 17 increase in the volume of tax credit fund partnership

noninterest expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 26 million or 3 sales commissions expense increased 6 million or 3 which is correlated with the 5 increase in overall institutional sales commission revenues business development expenses in fiscal year 2015 increased 4 million or 9 predominately in our equity capital markets operations representing recruiting and other costs as they pursue opportunities for future growth and revenues clearance and other expense increased 13 million or 19 primarily due to a higher volume of trades as reflected by the increase in institutional sales commission revenues and 3 million of expense related to historical european trading activities during fiscal year 2015 we made investments in our domestic equity capital markets business through successful recruiting of experienced professionals to broadly build out our life sciences sector capabilities and to increase investment banking coverage in the financial services energy and government services sectors while the immediate impact of these hires results in an increase in compensation expense we believe the longterm result of these efforts will have a favorable impact on both revenues and net profits of the segmentlosses of real estate partnerships held by consolidated vies result directly from the consolidation of certain lowincome housing tax credit funds and in

september 30 2015  asset managementrevenues increased 12 million or 3 to 404 million pretax income decreased 3 million or 2 to 132 million 52indextotal investment advisory and related administrative fee revenues increased by 6 million or 2 revenues from nondiscretionary assetbased administration activities increased 7 million or 10 primarily resulting from the 31 increase in assets held in such programs assets arising from our alex brown and 3macs acquisitions had little impact on revenues as the acquisitions occurred late in the fiscal year offsetting this increase advisory fee revenues from managed programs decreased by approximately 1 million although financial assets under management increased 118 billion or nearly 18 net of assets managed for affiliated entities compared to the prior year level such balances have been lower on fee billing dates during the current year also a portion of the increase in assets arose from our acquisition of alex brown which occurred late in the fiscal year other income increased 6 million or 12 resulting in part from rj trust which generated an increase in trust fee income arising from their 30 increase in trust assets from the prior year level in addition eagle received increased shareholder servicing fees and money market fee sharing related to the increase in interest ratesexpenses increased by approximately 16 million or 6 primarily resulting from an 11 million or 11 increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses a 2 million or 3 increase in investment subadvisory fee expense a 2 million or 7 increase in communications and information processing expense and a 2 million or 3 increase in other expense the increase in administrative and incentive compensation expenses results primarily from annual salary increases increases in personnel to support the growth of the business and increases in certain employee benefit plan costs in addition the prior year incentive compensation expense included a reversal of certain incentive compensation expense accruals for associates who left the firm during the prior year such a reversal did not recur in the current year the increase in subadvisory fee expense results from increased assets under management in applicable programs the increase in communication and information processing expense results from increased costs in support of growth in the business the increase in other expense is in part the result of an increase in revenue sharing with pcg certain regulatory compliance and legal expenses and certain incremental costs associated with cougar including amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitionnoncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries the portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased 1 million compared to the prior year as a result of the reduction in the amount of performance fee revenues earned in the current year that are attributable to othersyear ended september 30 2015 compared to the year ended september 30 2014  asset managementpretax income in the asset management segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 7 million or 5 investment advisory fee revenue in fiscal year 2015 increased by 21 million or 6 generated by an increase in assets under management that resulted from net inflows of client assets market values depreciated primarily as a result of the equity market decline that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 performance fees which are earned by managed funds for exceeding certain performance targets amounted to 5 million in fiscal year 2015 a decrease of 5 million from the amount earned in the prior year other revenue in fiscal year 2015 increased by 2 million or 4 primarily resulting from an increase in fee income generated by rj trust reflecting a 4 increase in rj trust client assets compared to the prior year to 351 billion as of september 30 2015expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by approximately 18 million or 8 primarily resulting from an 8 million or 18 increase in investment subadvisory fees a 3 million or 16 increase in communications and information support processing expense and a 7 million or 14 increase in other expenses the increase in investment subadvisory fee expense in fiscal year 2015 is primarily attributable to increased fees paid to external managers for raymond james consulting services and uma programs which both experienced increases in asset levels compared to the prior year the fiscal year 2015 increase in communications and information processing expense result from additional costs associated with supporting the steadily increasing levels of assets under management as well as the growth in asset levels in our nondiscretionary assetbased programs the increase in other expense in fiscal year 2015 is primarily due to eagles share of certain costs incurred in the organization and startup of a new fund in which eagle serves as the subadvisor  noncontrolling interests includes the impact of the consolidation of certain subsidiary investment advisors and other subsidiaries including clarivest total segment net income attributable to others in fiscal year 2015 decreased 2 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a reduction in the amount of performance

revenues increased 80 million or 19 to 494 million pretax income increased 59 million or 21 to 337 million the increase in pretax income was primarily attributable to a 75 million or 19 increase in net interest income and a 5 million or 43 increase in other income offset by an increase of 5 million or 20 in the provision for loan losses and a 16 million or 15 increase in noninterest expenses excluding provision for loan losses  the 75 million increase in net interest income was the result of a 26 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets partially offset by a small decline in net interest margin the increase in average interestearning banking assets was driven by a 22 billion increase in average loans and a 443 million increase in average cash and investments the increase in average loans was comprised of a 14 billion or 16 increase in average corporate loans a 444 million or 35 increase in average sbl balances and a 291 million or 15 increase in average residential mortgage loans the net interest margin decreased to 304 from 307 due to an increase in average loweryielding cash balances in addition to an increase in total cost of funds to 016 from 010 the average interestearning banking assets yield increased slightly to 318 from 315 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in the loan portfolio yield to 342 from 334 this resulted primarily from the federal reserve banks december 2015 increase in shortterm interest rates the increase in total cost of funds primarily resulted from an increase in deposit and borrowing costs which includes additional expense from our interest rate hedging activities borrowing costs increased to 181 from 061 in the prior yearcorresponding to the increase in average interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities increased 24 billion to 143 billion the increase in the provision for loan losses as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher corporate loan growth the charges during the current year related to loans outstanding within the energy sector as well as additional provision for corporate loan downgrades resulting in higher criticized loans as compared to the prior year the provision for loan losses also reflects the offsetting impact of improved credit characteristics from the continued decline in residential mortgage loan delinquencies and nonperforming loansother income increased 5 million as compared to prior year primarily due to increases in affiliate income related to the current year growth in securitiesbased lending gains realized from the sale of available for sale securities trading gains as a result of higher sales of small business administration sba loan securitizations and lower foreign exchange lossesnoninterest expenses excluding provision for loan losses increased 16 million as compared to the prior year the current year expense included an 8 million increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees and a 4 million increase in fdic insurance premiums both resulting from the increase in deposit balances other increases in noninterest expense included a 2 million increase in sbl affiliate fees due to increased sbl balances a 2 million increase in communications and information processing expense a 2 million increase in compensation and benefits resulting from salary increases and staff additions and a 1 million increase in equity losses related to rj banks investment in low income housing tax credit projects these losses are by design of the investment structure income tax credits not reflected in the pretax operating results of the segment are received by rjf which net an overall positive return on such investments these increases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by a 3 million decrease in expense related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments year ended september 30 2015 compared to the year ended september 30 2014  rj bankpretax income in the rj bank segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 36 million or 15 compared to fiscal year 2014 the increase in pretax income in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a 63 million or 18 increase in net revenues offset by an increase of 10 million or 74 in the provision for loan losses and a 17 million or 17 increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses the increase in net revenues in fiscal year 2015 was attributable to a 57 million increase in net interest income and a 6 million increase in other income  the 57 million increase in net interest income in fiscal year 2015 was the result of a 16 billion increase in average interestearning banking assets and an increase in the net interest margin compared to fiscal year 2014 the increase in average interestearning banking assets in fiscal year 2015 was primarily driven by a 21 billion increase in average loans offset by a 440 million decrease in average cash and investments in fiscal year 2015 average corporate loans increased 14 billion or 19 average sbl balances increased 488 million or 62 and average residential mortgage loans increased 173 million or 10 the yield on interestearning banking assets increased to 315 from 304 due to an improvement in the earningasset composition from loweryielding cash and investments to a larger percentage of higher yielding loans in fiscal year 2015 the loan portfolio yield 61indexdecreased slightly in fiscal year 2015 to 334 from 339 in fiscal year 2014 primarily as a result of the increase in the yield of the average interestearning banking assets in fiscal year 2015 the net interest margin increased to 307 from 298corresponding to the increase in average interestearning banking assets average interestbearing banking liabilities in fiscal year 2015 increased 14 billion to 119 billionthe increase in other income in fiscal year 2015 was due to a decrease of 4 million in foreign currency losses a 1 million increase resulting from held for sale loan activities and a 1 million increase in gains from the sale of foreclosed propertiesa significant portion of the provision for loan losses in both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 resulted from loan portfolio growth in each year the primary factors impacting the year over year increase in provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 results from the varying impact of credit characteristics which were particular to fiscal year 2015 and 2014 the fiscal year 2015 provision for loan losses was impacted by an increase in corporate criticized loans which was partially offset by the impact of improved credit characteristics of the residential mortgage loan portfolio fiscal year 2014 benefited to a greater extent than fiscal year 2015 from the improved credit characteristics of the loan portfolio including a decrease in corporate criticized loans the 17 million increase in noninterest expenses excluding the provision for loan losses in fiscal year 2015 was primarily attributable to a 3 million or 68 increase in sbl affiliate fees due to increases in sbl balances a 2 million or 5 increase in affiliate deposit account servicing fees related to increased deposit balances a 2 million increase in expenses related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments a 2 million or 17 increase in fdic insurance premiums a 2 million or 9 increase in compensation and benefits resulting from

arising from certain canadian denominated liabilities did not recur in the current year and interest income increased 5 million resulting from the increase in interest rates and higher corporate cash balances throughout most of the current yearinterest expense increased 1 million or 1 the most significant component of the increase was the interest expense incurred on our senior notes which increased by 2 million or 3 as the average outstanding balance increased due to our july 2016 issuance of 800 million of senior notes payable the new issuances more than offset the impact of the april 2016 repayment of 250 million in maturing senior notes see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional informationcompensation and other expense increased

in fiscal year 2015 decreased by approximately 19 million or 23net revenues in this segment in fiscal year 2015 increased 25 million or 71 the increase in fiscal year 2015 results from a 25 million increase in revenues arising from our principal capital and private equity portfolio investments we also realized an increase in fiscal year 2015 revenues arising from the sale or redemption activities in our ars portfolio of 4 million which were offset by certain foreign currency translation losses that primarily result from the weakened canadian dollar and decreases in the valuation of other investments primarily in managed equities the fiscal year 2015 ars portfolio gain is primarily the result of an 11 million gain on the sale of all of our jefferson county alabama limited obligation school warrants ars in the fiscal year 2014 gains resulting from sales and redemption activities in our ars portfolio were primarily comprised of a 55 million gain on the redemption of jefferson county alabama sewer revenue refunding warrants ars the portion of revenue attributable to noncontrolling interests in fiscal year 2015 increased 8 million as the increase in revenues

generated a 650 million increase in cash increases in cash from operations includean increase in brokerage client payables had a 182 billion favorable impact on cash the increase largely results from two factors first many clients reacted to uncertainties in the equity markets by increasing the cash balances in their brokerage accounts second our brokerage client account balances increased as a result of our fiscal year 2016 acquisitions of alex brown and 3macs cumulatively these two factors result in the increase in brokerage client payables and a corresponding increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations which is discussed belowstock loaned net of stock borrowed increased 153 millionaccrued compensation commissions and benefits increased 46 million as a result of the increased financial results we achieved in fiscal year 2016 offsetting these decreases in cash used in operations resulted from a 195 billion increase in assets segregated pursuant to regulations and other segregated assets primarily resulting from the increase in client cash balances described above64indexan increase in our brokerage client receivables and other receivables of 621 millionloans provided

shortterm borrowings of 115 million payment of dividends to our shareholders of 113 million the effect of currency exchange rates on our cash balances has resulted in a 29 million decrease in our us dollar denominated cash balance during the year ended september 30 2016 this effect is primarily attributable to cash balances we have that are denominated in canadian currency while the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate increased 17 since september 30 2015 which has a favorable impact on this measure the amount of our cash balance denominated in canadian currency has also increased the effect of which more than offsets the favorable impact of the change in exchange rateswe believe our existing assets most of which are liquid in nature together with funds generated from

financing our business total assets of 316 billion at september 30 2016 are approximately 513 billion or 19 greater than our total assets as of september 30 2015 net bank loans receivable increased 222 billion primarily due to the growth of rj banks corporate loan portfolio during the year additionally assets segregated pursuant to federal regulations for the benefit of our clients increased 198 billion most significantly due to the increase in our brokerage client payable balances discussed in the following paragraph in addition to a number of other less significant factors brokerage client receivables increased 529 million primarily resulting from an increase in margin loan balances arising from our acquisition of alex brown loans to financial advisors increased 350 million resulting

requirementscritical accounting estimatesthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during any reporting period in our consolidated financial statements management has established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure the appropriateness of such estimates and assumptions and their consistent application from period to period for a description of our significant accounting policies see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k we believe that of our accounting estimates and assumptions those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity due to their nature estimates involve judgment based upon available information actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements therefore understanding these critical accounting estimates is important in understanding the reported results of our operations and our financial positionvaluation of certain financial instruments investments and other assetsthe use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income is fundamental to our financial statements and our risk management processes trading instruments and available for sale securities are reflected in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in our net income or our total comprehensive income depending on the underlying purpose of the instrumentwe measure the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap which defines fair value establishes a framework that we use to measure fair value and provides for certain disclosures we provide about our fair value measurements included in our financial statements fair value is defined by gaap as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date we determine the fair values of our financial instruments and any other assets and liabilities required by gaap to be recognized at fair value in the financial statements as of the close of business of each financial statement reporting period these fair value determination processes also apply to any of our impairment tests or assessments performed for nonfinancial instruments such as goodwill identifiable intangible assets certain real estate owned and other longlived assetsin determining the fair value of our financial instruments in accordance with gaap we use various valuation approaches including market andor income approaches fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant as such even when assumptions from market participants are not readily available our own assumptions reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date gaap provides for the following three levels to be used to classify our fair value measurements level 1financial instruments included in level 1 are highly liquid instruments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities these include equity securities traded in active markets and certain u s treasury securities other governmental obligations or publicly traded corporate debt securities level 2financial instruments reported in level 2 include those that have pricing inputs that are other than quoted prices in active markets but which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date ie prices for similar instruments instruments that are generally included in this category are equity securities that are not actively traded corporate obligations infrequently traded certain government and municipal obligations interest rate swaps certain assetbacked securities abs certain collateralized mortgage obligations cmos certain mbs certain other derivative instruments brokered certificate 72indexof deposits corporate loans and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain loans held for sale impaired loans and other real estate owned oreolevel 3financial instruments reported in level 3 have little if any market activity and are measured using our best estimate of fair value where the inputs into the determination of fair value are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable these valuations require significant judgment or estimation instruments in this category generally include equity securities with unobservable inputs such as those investments made in our principal capital activities certain nonagency abs pools of interestonly sba loan strips io strips certain municipal and corporate obligations which include ars and nonrecurring fair value measurements for certain impaired loansgaap requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when performing our fair value measurements the availability of observable inputs can vary from instrument to instrument and in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases an instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement of an instrument requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the instrument see notes 5 6 7 and 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our financial instrumentsinvestments in private equity measured at net asset value per shareeffective september 30 2016 we adopted new accounting guidance related to the classification and disclosure of certain investments using the net asset value nav as a practical expedient to measure the fair value of the investment among its provisions this new guidance eliminates for all investments in which fair value is measured using nav as a practical expedient the requirement to categorize such investments within the fair value hierarchy we have retroactively applied this new guidance to investments held in the prior fiscal year as a practical expedient we utilize nav or its equivalent to determine the recorded value of a portion of our private equity portfolio we utilize nav when the fund investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and the nav of the fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of investment company accounting including measurement of the investments at fair value see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our private equity investments measured at nav level 3 assets and liabilitiesas of september 30 2016 8 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilities are financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis in comparison as of september 30 2015 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis represented 7 of our total assets and 3 of our total liabilitiesfinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis categorized as level 3 amount to 215 million as of september 30 2016 and represent 9 of our assets measured at fair value of the level 3 assets as of september 30 2016 our ars positions comprise 125 million or 58 and our private equity investments not measured at nav comprise 83 million or 39 of the total our level 3 assets decreased 9 million or 4 as compared to the september 30 2015 level our ars portfolio decreased approximately 14 million compared to september 30 2015 primarily resulting from decreases in the valuation of the portfolio and to a lesser extent sales and redemption activities see notes 5 and 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information offsetting this decrease our private equity investments not measured at nav increased 6 million as valuation increases more than offset the net impact of capital contributeddistributions received level 3 assets represent 4 of total equity as of september 30 2016 reflecting a decrease from the 5 of total equity measure as of september 30 2015financial instruments which are liabilities categorized as level 3 amount are insignificant as of both september 30 2016 and 2015valuation techniquesthe fair value for certain of our financial instruments is derived using pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment the price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of our financial instruments financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments that 73indexare thinly traded or not quoted in accordance with gaap the criteria used to determine whether the market for a financial instrument is active or inactive is based on the particular asset or liability for equity securities our definition of actively traded is based on average daily volume and other market trading statistics we have determined the market for certain other types of financial instruments including certain cmos abs certain collateralized debt obligations and ars to be volatile uncertain or inactive as of both september 30 2016 and 2015 as a result the valuation of these financial instruments included significant management judgment in determining the relevance and reliability of market information available we considered the inactivity of the market to be evidenced by several factors including a continued decreased price transparency caused by decreased volume of trades relative to historical levels stale transaction prices and transaction prices that varied significantly either over time or among market makersthe level within the fair value hierarchy specific valuation techniques and other significant accounting policies pertaining to certain financial instruments with the most significant carrying values that are presented in our consolidated statements of financial condition as of september 30 2016 are described belowtrading instruments and trading instruments sold but not yet purchasedtrading securities are comprised primarily of the financial instruments held by our brokerdealer subsidiaries see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information when available we use quoted prices in active markets to determine the fair value of these securities such instruments are classified within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy examples include exchange traded equity securities and liquid government debt securities as of september 30 2016 4 of our gross trading security assets and 62 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 1 of the fair value hierarchywhen trading securities are traded in secondary markets and quoted market prices do not exist for such securities we utilize valuation techniques including matrix pricing to estimate fair value matrix pricing generally utilizes spreadbased models periodically recalibrated to observable inputs such as market trades or to dealer price bids in similar securities in order to derive the fair value of the instruments valuation techniques may also rely on other observable inputs such as yield curves interest rates and expected principal repayments and default probabilities instruments valued using these inputs are typically classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy examples include certain municipal debt securities corporate debt securities agency mbs brokered certificates of deposit and restricted equity securities in public companies we utilize prices from independent services to corroborate our estimate of fair value depending upon the type of security the pricing service may provide a listed price a matrix price or use other methods including brokerdealer price quotations as of september 30 2016 96 of our gross trading security assets and 38 of our gross trading securities sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 2 of the fair value hierarchypositions in illiquid trading securities that do not have readily determinable fair values require significant judgment or estimation for these securities we use pricing models discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques assumptions utilized by these techniques include estimates of future delinquencies loss severities defaults and prepayments or redemptions securities valued using these techniques are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for certain cmos where there has been limited activity or less transparency around significant inputs to the valuation such as assumptions regarding performance of the underlying mortgages these securities are currently classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as of september 30 2016 less than 1 of our gross trading security assets and none of our trading instruments sold but not yet purchased are classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into derivatives contracts as part of our fixed income operations in either overthecounter market activities or through matched book activities see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for more information fair values for the interest rate derivative contracts arising from our overthecounter market activities are obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from third party counterparty derivatives dealers to corroborate the output of our internal pricing models the fair value of any cash collateral exchanged as part of the interest rate swap contract is netted by counterparty against the fair value of the derivative instrumentfair value for our matched book derivatives are determined using an internal model which includes inputs from independent pricing sources to project future cash flows under each underlying derivative contract the cash flows are discounted to determine the present value since any changes in fair value are completely offset by an opposite change in the offsetting transaction position 74indexthere is no net impact on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments we record the value of each matched book derivative position held at fair value as either an asset or an offsetting liability presented as derivative instruments associated with offsetting matched book positions as applicable on our consolidated statements of financial condition rj bank enters into three month forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk related to their investment in their canadian subsidiary these derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition the majority of which are designated as net investment hedges the fair value of rj banks forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by obtaining valuations from a third party pricing service these third party valuations are based on observable inputs such as spot rates foreign exchange rates and both us and canadian interest rate curves we validate the observable inputs utilized in the third party valuation model by preparing an independent calculation using a secondary third party valuation model these forward foreign exchange contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we enter into certain interest rate swap contracts the rj bank interest hedges which swap variable interest payments on debt for fixed interest payments through the rj bank interest hedges rj bank is able to mitigate a portion of the market risk associated with certain fixed rate interest earning assets held by rj bank the rj bank interest hedges are recorded at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition and are designated as cash flow hedges the fair value of rj bank interest hedges is obtained from internal pricing models that consider current market trading levels and the contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments as well as time value yield curve and other volatility factors underlying the positions since our model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the models do not require significant judgment such derivative contracts are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy we utilize values obtained from a third party to corroborate the output of our internal pricing modelsavailable for sale securitiesavailable for sale securities are comprised primarily of mbs cmos and other equity securities held predominately by rj bank the rj bank afs securities and ars held by a nonbrokerdealer subsidiary of rjf collectively referred to as the rjf afs securities of the rjf afs securities 85 of the portfolio is classified as level 2 and 15 is classified as level 3 of the fair value hierarchydebt and equity securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of deferred taxes recorded through other comprehensive loss income and thereafter presented in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income aoci unless the loss is considered to be otherthantemporary in which case the related credit loss portion is recognized as a loss in other revenue realized gains and losses on sales of such securities are recognized using the specific identification method and reflected in other revenue in the period they are soldthe fair value of agency and nonagency securities included within the rj bank afs securities is determined by obtaining third party pricing service bid quotations from two independent pricing services third party pricing service bid quotations are based on either current market data or the most recently available market data the third party pricing services provide comparable price evaluations utilizing available market data for similar securities the market data the third party pricing services utilize for these price evaluations includes observable data comprised of benchmark yields reported trades brokerdealer quotes issuer spreads twosided markets benchmark securities bids offers reference data including market research publications and loan performance experience in order to validate that the pricing information used by the primary third party pricing service is observable we request on a quarterly basis some of the key market data available for a sample of securities and compare this data to that which we observed in our independent accumulation of market information securities valued using these valuation techniques are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyfor nonagency securities within the rj bank afs securities where a significant difference exists between the primary third party pricing service bid quotation and the secondary third party pricing service we utilize a discounted cash flow analysis to determine which third party price quote is more representative of fair value under the current market conditions the fair values for most nonagency securities at september 30 2016 were based on the respective primary third party pricing service bid quotation securities measured using these valuation techniques are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchyars are longterm variable rate securities tied to shortterm interest rates that were intended to be reset through a dutch auction process which generally occurs every seven to 35 days holders of ars were previously able to liquidate their holdings to prospective buyers by participating in the auctions during 2008 the dutch auction process failed and holders were no longer able to liquidate their holdings through the auction process the fair value of the ars holdings is estimated based on internal pricing models the pricing model takes into consideration the characteristics of the underlying securities as well as multiple 75indexinputs including the issuer and its credit quality data from any recent trades the expected timing of redemptions and an estimated yield premium that a market participant would require over otherwise comparable securities to compensate for the illiquidity of the ars these inputs require significant management judgment and accordingly these securities are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchyfor any rjf afs securities in an unrealized loss position at the reporting period end we make an assessment whether these securities are impaired on an otherthantemporary basis in order to evaluate our risk exposure and any potential impairment of these securities on at least a quarterly basis we review the characteristics of each security owned such as where applicable collateral type delinquency and foreclosure levels credit enhancement projected loan losses collateral coverage the presence of us government or government agency guarantees and issuer credit rating the following factors are considered to determine whether an impairment is otherthantemporary our intention to sell the security our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and whether the evidence indicating that we will recover the amortized cost basis of a security in full outweighs evidence to the contrary evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment the severity and duration of the impairment changes in value subsequent to period end recent events specific to the issuer or industry and forecasted performance of the security securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be otherthantemporary are writtendown to fair value with the credit loss portion of the writedown recorded as a realized loss in other revenue and the noncredit portion of the writedown recorded net of deferred taxes in other comprehensive loss income and are thereafter presented in equity as a component of aoci the credit loss portion of the writedown is the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of the security the previous amortized cost basis of the security less the otherthantemporary impairment recognized in earnings establishes the new cost basis for the securityfor any rjf afs securities we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model for rj bank afs securities our discounted cash flow model utilizes relevant assumptions such as prepayment rate default rate and loss severity on a loan level basis these assumptions are subject to change depending on a number of factors such as economic conditions changes in home prices and delinquency and foreclosure statistics among others events that may trigger material declines in fair values or additional credit losses for these securities in the future would include but are not limited to deterioration of credit metrics significantly higher levels of default and severity of loss on the underlying collateral deteriorating credit enhancement and loss coverage ratios or further illiquidityprivate equity investmentsprivate equity investments are carried at either nav as a practical expedient or fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy our total private equity investments as of september 30 2016 amount to 195 million prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own of this 57 are valued using the nav as a practical expedient and 43 are valued at fair value the valuation of these investments at fair value requires significant management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices inherent lack of liquidity and longterm nature of these assets as a result these values cannot be determined with precision and the calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the instrument in comparison our total private equity investments gross value prior to the consideration of the noncontrolling interest portion we do not own as of september 30 2015 amounted to 209 million of this total 63 were valued using nav as a practical expedient and 37 were valued at fair value utilizing valuation techniques categorized as level 3 see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for additional information on our private equity investments including the amounts associated with noncontrolling interestsvaluation of identifiable intangible assetsduring fiscal year 2016 we acquired alex brown 3macs and mummert in each case we accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting with the assets and liabilities recorded as of the acquisition date at their respective fair values in our consolidated financial statements the assets to be measured at fair value include any acquired identifiable intangible assets including but not limited to assets such as trade names customer relationships noncompete agreements and contracts which include favorable termsthe process of identifying potential identifiable assets to value in any acquisition transaction is subjective and involves management judgment estimating the fair value of identifiable intangible assets involves the use of valuation techniques that rely on significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions may include forecasted revenue growth rates forecasted allocations of expense and riskadjusted discount rates we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable given the information that is available to us at the time of our assessment however actual future results may differ significantly from those estimates 76indexin some instances depending on the nature of the intangible asset the determination of the useful life of the asset can also be subjective and involve significant management judgmentthe outcome of the identifiable intangible asset valuation process has a direct inverse impact on the determination of the amount of goodwill arising from the application of the acquisition method of accounting for the transaction the greater the identifiable intangible asset valuation the lower the goodwill additionally the greater the identifiable intangible asset the greater amortization expense associated with such asset will be in future periods and therefore the lower future net income will begoodwill impairmentgoodwill under gaap must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually the annual goodwill impairment testing involves the application of significant management judgment especially when estimating the fair value of its reporting units we perform goodwill testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have elected december 31 as our annual goodwill impairment evaluation date during the quarter ended march 31 2016 we performed a qualitative impairment assessment for certain of our reporting units and a quantitative impairment assessment for our two rj ltd reporting units operating in canada for each reporting unit that we performed qualitative assessments we determined whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of such reporting unit including the recorded goodwill is in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit in any instance in which we are unable to qualitatively conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill a quantitative analysis of the fair value of the reporting unit would be performed based upon the outcome of our qualitative assessments we determined that no quantitative analysis of the fair value of any of the reporting units we elected to qualitatively analyze for impairment as of december 31 2015 was required and we concluded that none of the goodwill allocated to any of those reporting units as of december 31 2015 was impaired no events have occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testingin the rj ltd reporting unit testing we elected to perform quantitative assessments for the two reporting units within rj ltd that include an allocation of goodwill although gaap provides the option to perform a qualitative analysis which may result in a conclusion that no quantitative analysis of the reporting unit equity value is required for this years annual goodwill testing of our two rj ltd reporting units we elected to perform a quantitative analysis in these analyses we make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows and discount rates as well as utilize data from peer group companies to assess the equity value of each rj ltd reporting unit based upon the outcome of our quantitative assessments we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd pcg reporting unit was substantially in excess of its book carrying value which includes goodwill however primarily as a result of the unfavorable impacts of the prolonged commodity recession in canada on our business most specifically impacting the natural resources sector of that economy the fair value of the equity of the rj ltd ecm reporting unit is not substantially in excess of its book carrying value which includes goodwill the rj ltd ecm reporting unit goodwill balance was 169 million as of december 31 2015 and we estimate that the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over its carrying value including goodwill approximates 10 should the equity market conditions in canada fail to improve or we otherwise fail to perform as we have projected an impairment charge of some portion or perhaps all of such goodwill could occur refer to note 13 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for a discussion of the valuation methodologies and a summary of the key assumptions we applied in determining the fair value of our two rj ltd reporting units  no events have occurred since december 31 2015 that would cause us to update this impairment testingdeterioration in economic market conditions especially those impacting revenues reported in our pcg and capital markets segments as well as increased costs arising from the effects of recent regulatory or legislative changes may result in declines in reporting unit performance beyond managements current expectations declines in reporting unit performance increases in equity capital requirements or increases in the estimated cost of equity could cause the estimated fair values of our reporting units or their associated goodwill to decline which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill77indexloss

evaluating its probable loan losses includes a complex analysis of several quantitative and qualitative factors requiring a substantial amount of judgment due to the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate and the allowance for loan losses could then be insufficient to cover actual losses in such an event any losses would result in a decrease in our net income as well as a decrease in the level of regulatory capital at rj bank the provision for loan losses in the current year includes a provision resulting from an increase in the qualitative reserve related to loans in the energy sectorincome taxesthe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year we utilize the asset and liability method to provide income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements this method requires that income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and tax purposes accordingly a deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference is determined based on the tax rates that we expect to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are realized judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns including the repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position results of operations or liquidity we have provided for us deferred income taxes on undistributed earnings not considered permanently reinvested in our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that the cumulative undistributed earnings of nonus subsidiaries are considered to be permanently invested no deferred us federal income taxes have been provided because the time or manner of repatriation is uncertain we cannot determine the impact of local taxes withholding taxes and foreign tax credits associated with the future repatriation of such earnings and therefore cannot quantify the tax liability that would be payable in the event all such foreign earnings are repatriated at the present time we have no plans or intentions to repatriate funds for which no us income tax has been provided see note 20 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further
