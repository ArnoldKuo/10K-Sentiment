or supervisory policy may have a material effect on our businessrules and regulations resulting from the doddfrank actin july 2010 the us government enacted sweeping changes to the supervision and regulation of the financial industry through the passage of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the doddfrank act the doddfrank act requires us federal banking and other regulatory agencies to conduct hundreds of rulemakings studies and reports these regulatory agencies include the commodity futures trading commission the securities and exchange commission the sec the fed the occ the fdic the cfpb and the financial stability oversight council certain elements of the doddfrank act became effective immediately however the details of some provisions are subject to implementing regulations furthermore some provisions of the doddfrank act are still subject to further rulemaking proceedings and studies and will take effect over the next several years as a result of the doddfrank act and other regulatory reforms we are experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation and supervision these changes could have a significant impact on how we conduct our business many regulatory or supervisory policies remain in a state of flux as a result we cannot specifically quantify the impact that such regulatory or supervisory requirements will have on our business and operations see item 1a risk factors within this report for further discussion of the potential future impact on our operations below we highlight certain of the more significant changes brought about as a result of the doddfrank actfdic assessment ratessince rj bank provides deposits covered by fdic insurance generally up to 250000 per account ownership type rj bank is subject to the federal deposit insurance act in february 2011 pursuant to the doddfrank act the fdic issued a final rule changing its assessment base for banks with greater than 10 billion in

beginning with fiscal year 2014 the cfpb assumed supervisory authority over rj bank for its compliance with the various federal consumer protection laws the cfpb has authority to promulgate regulations issue orders draft policy statements conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions the creation of the cfpb has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws to the extent that as a result of such heightened scrutiny and oversight we become the subject of any enforcement activity we may be required to pay fines incur penalties or engage in certain remediation effortsstress testsin october 2012 the fed fdic and occ jointly issued final rules requiring certain bank holding companies state member banks and savings and loan companies with total assets between

companies and their affiliates together banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund covered funds banking entities engaged in proprietary trading andor investments in covered funds must establish a volcker rulespecific compliance program we have adopted a program which is designed to be effective

in and relationships with covered funds the conformance period for compliance with the rule with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds has been extended and banking entities may still apply for an additional fiveyear extension with respect to investments in certain illiquid funds we maintain a number of private equity investments some of which meet the definition of covered funds under the volcker rule the extension of the conformance deadline provides us with additional time to realize the value of these investments in due course and implement any additional actions necessary for conformance with the rule to the extent that any of our covered funds satisfy the feds criteria for further extension for certain illiquid funds we may apply for such extensions although there is no assurance that any such extension would be grantedbasel iii and us capital rulesboth rjf as a bank holding company and rj bank are subject to capital requirements that have increased due to recent

the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information regarding rjf and rj bank regulatory capital levels and ratios including information regarding the capital conservation buffer the increased capital requirements could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected see item 1a risk factors within this report for more informationfailure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger discretionary and in certain cases mandatory actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on the financial results of rjf and rj bank under capital adequacy guidelines rjf and rj bank must meet

of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further informationmoney market fundsin july 2014 the sec adopted amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds the amendments make structural and operational reforms to address risks of excessive withdrawals over relatively short time frames by investors from money market funds while preserving the benefits of the funds we do not sponsor any money market funds we utilize such funds in limited circumstances for our own investment purposes as well as to offer our clients with money market funds that are sponsored by third parties as one of several cash sweep alternativesmunicipal advisor regulationin september 2013 the sec issued final rules regarding the mandatory registration of municipal advisors as required under the doddfrank act these final rules for municipal advisors which became effective in july 2014 i impose a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities ii may result in the need for new written representations by issuers and iii may limit the manner in which we in our capacity as an underwriter or in our other professional roles interact with municipal issuers our municipal finance business became subject to additional regulation and oversight by the sec by virtue of our registration with the sec as a municipal advisor in 2014 in august 2014 the sec also announced that it will undertake a twoyear review of municipal advisors as part of an exam initiative 12indexmoreover in december 2015 the municipal securities rulemaking board the msrb received approval from the sec on new msrb rule g42 regarding duties of nonsolicitor municipal advisors and related amendments to msrb rule g8 regarding books and records to be made by municipal advisors among others all of which became effective in june 2016 additional rulemaking by the msrb may cause further changes to the manner in which state and local governments are able to interact with outside finance professionals these new rules may impact the nature of our interactions with public finance clients as well as potentially have a negative shortterm impact on the volume of public finance financing transactions while the industry attempts to adapt to the new regulatory landscape however we do not expect these new rules to have a materially adverse impact on our public finance results of operations which are included in our capital markets segment fiduciary duty standardpursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors the sec has not yet proposed rules relating to a new standard of conduct applicable to brokerdealers however in april 2016 the us department of labor the dol issued its final regulation the dol rule expanding the definition of who is deemed an investment advice fiduciary under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 as amended erisa as a result of giving investment advice to a plan plan participant or beneficiary as well as under the internal revenue code for individual retirement arrangements iras and nonerisa plans collectively qualified plans as a result of adopting a new definition of fiduciary under erisa the final rule extends fiduciary status to many investment professionals that have not been considered fiduciaries under current law a fiduciary is subject to strict duties to act solely in the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and is personally liable to the erisa plan for breaches in its discharge of its duties the dol rule also contains exemptions including the best interest contract exemption the bic exemption and principal transactions in certain assets exemption the principal transactions exemption designed to enable investment professionals that will become fiduciaries to continue to operate under existing business models that would otherwise be prohibited subject to compliance with new conditions in order to rely on these exemptions we will be required to i act under defined impartial conduct standards that are in the best interest of our client ii adopt certain anticonflict policies and procedures iii provide disclosure of certain information relating to fees compensation and defined material conflicts of interest iv provide a written acknowledgment of fiduciary status and v for iras and nonerisa plans enter into an enforceable contract with our client that contains extensive warranties and does not allow exculpatory provisions waiving the clients rights and remedies including the right to participate in a class action in court the dol rule became effective as of june 7 2016 with phasein of the fiduciary definition not applicable until april 10 2017 and further transition periods until january 1 2018 applying to both the bic exemption and principal transactions exemptionwe are evaluating the impact of the dol rule on our business however because qualified accounts particularly ira accounts comprise a significant portion of our business we expect that compliance with the dol rule and reliance on the bic exemption and the principal transactions exemption will require us to incur increased legal compliance and information technology costs in addition as discussed above we may face enhanced legal risksincentivebased compensation arrangementspursuant to the doddfrank act six federal agencies are charged with jointly prescribing regulations or guidelines related to the prohibition of incentivebased compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks at certain financial institutions the agencies have released a proposed rule that would prohibit certain forms of incentivebased compensation arrangements for financial institutions with greater than 1 billion in total assets the incentivebased compensation proposal much of the incentivebased compensation proposal would apply to financial institutions categorized as either level 1 institutions assets of 250 billion or more or level 2 institutions assets of 50 billion to 250 billion while level 3 institutions assets of 1 billion to 50 billion would be subject to less extensive obligations all covered financial institutions would be required to among other requirements i annually document the structure of their incentivebased compensation arrangements ii retain records of such annual documentation for at least seven years and iii comply with general prohibitions on incentivebased compensation arrangements that could encourage inappropriate risktaking should the incentivebased compensation proposal be adopted we would be subject to the rules requirements as a level 3 financial institution which would require us to incur additional legal and compliance costs as well as subject us to increased legal risks13indexother regulations applicable to our

exhaustive there may be factors not discussed below or in this form 10k that adversely impact our results of operations harm our reputation or inhibit our ability to generate new business prospectsrisks related to our business and industrydamage to our reputation could damage our businessesmaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients customers investors and associates if we fail to address or appear to fail to address issues that may give rise to reputational risk we could significantly harm our business prospects these issues may include but are not limited to any of the risks discussed in this item 1a including appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest legal and regulatory requirements ethical issues money laundering cybersecurity and privacy recordkeeping and sales and trading practices the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels and the proper identification of the legal reputational credit liquidity and market risks inherent in our products failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny all of which can lead to lost revenue higher operating costs and reputational harm further negative publicity about us whether or not true may also harm our future business prospects we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic conditions that impact the global financial markets we are engaged in various financial services businesses as such we are affected by domestic and international macroeconomic and political conditions including economic output levels interest and inflation rates employment levels prices of commodities including oil and gas consumer confidence levels and fiscal and monetary policy for example fed policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the return earned on those loans and investments the market impact from such policies also can decrease materially the value of certain of our financial assets most notably debt securities changes in fed policies are beyond our control and consequently the impact of these changes on our activities and results of our operations are difficult to predict macroeconomic conditions also may directly and indirectly impact a number of factors in the global financial markets that may be detrimental to our operating results including trading levels investing and origination activity in the securities markets security valuations the absolute and relative level and volatility of interest and currency rates real estate values the actual and perceived quality of issuers and borrowers and the supply of and demand for loans and deposits 16indexat times over the last several years we have experienced operating cycles during weak and uncertain us and global economic conditions including low economic output levels artificially maintained levels of historically low interest rates relatively high unemployment rates and significant uncertainty with respect to domestic and international fiscal and monetary policy these conditions led to changes in the global financial markets that from time to time negatively impacted our net revenue and profitability while global financial markets have shown signs of improvement uncertainty remains a period of sustained downturns andor volatility in the securities markets prolonged continuation of the artificially low level of shortterm interest rates a return to increased credit market dislocations reductions in the value of real estate and other negative market factors could significantly impair our revenues and profitability we could experience a decline in commission revenue from lower trading volumes a decline in fees from reduced portfolio values of securities managed on behalf of our clients a reduction in revenue from capital markets and advisory transactions due to reduced activity increased credit provisions and chargeoffs losses sustained from our customers and market participants failure to fulfill their settlement obligations reduced net interest earnings and other losses periods of reduced revenue and other losses could be accompanied by periods of reduced profitability because certain of our expenses including but not limited to our interest expense on debt rent facilities and salary expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce them over short time periods is limited  us markets may also be impacted by political and civil unrest occurring in the middle east and in eastern europe and russia concerns about the european union eu including britains june 23 2016 referendum to exit the eu brexit and the stability of the eus sovereign debt has caused uncertainty and disruption for financial markets globally continued uncertainties loom over the outcome of the eus financial support programs it is possible that other eu member states may experience financial troubles in the future or may choose to follow britains lead and leave the eu any negative impact on economic conditions and global markets from these developments could adversely affect our business financial condition and liquidity us state and local governments also continue to struggle with budget pressures caused by the ongoing less than optimal economic environment and ongoing concerns regarding municipal issuer credit quality if these trends continue or worsen investor concerns could potentially reduce the number and size of transactions in which we participate and in turn reduce investment banking revenues in addition such factors could adversely affect the value of the municipal securities we hold in our trading securities portfoliorj bank is particularly affected by economic conditions in north america market conditions in the united states and canada can be assessed through the following metrics the level and volatility of interest rates the unemployment and underemployment rates real estate prices consumer confidence levels and changes in consumer spending and the number of personal bankruptcies among others deterioration of market conditions can diminish loan demand lead to an increase in mortgage and other loan delinquencies affect loan repayment performance and result in higher reserves and net chargeoffs which can adversely affect our earningslack of liquidity or access to capital could impair our business and financial conditionwe must maintain appropriate liquidity levels our inability to maintain adequate liquidity and readily available access to the credit and capital markets could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition if liquidity from our brokerage or banking operations is inadequate or unavailable we may be required to scale back or curtail our operations including limiting our efforts to recruit additional financial advisors sell assets at unfavorable prices and cut or eliminate dividend payments our liquidity could be negatively affected by the inability of our subsidiaries to generate cash in the form of dividends from earnings regulatory changes to the liquidity or capital requirements applicable to our subsidiaries that may prevent us from upstreaming cash to the parent company limited or no accessibility to credit markets for secured and unsecured borrowings by our subsidiaries diminished access to the capital markets for rjf and other commitments or restrictions on capital as a result of adverse legal settlements judgments or regulatory sanctions furthermore as a bank holding company we may become subject to a prohibition or limitations on our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock the occ the fed the fdic and the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the duty to prohibit or to limit dividend payments by regulated subsidiaries to their parentthe availability of financing including access to the credit and capital markets depends on various factors such as conditions in the debt and equity markets the general availability of credit the volume of securities trading activity the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector and our credit ratings our cost of capital and the availability of funding may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads additionally lenders may from time to time curtail or even cease to provide funding to borrowers as a result of future concerns over the strength of specific counterparties as well as the stability of markets generally see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity risk17indexa downgrade in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our operations earnings and financial conditionif our credit ratings were downgraded or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur our business financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged and as a result adversely affect our client relationships such a change in our credit ratings could also adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position increase our borrowing costs limit our access to the capital markets trigger obligations under certain financial agreements or decrease the number of investors clients and counterparties willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us thereby curtailing our business operations and reducing profitability we may not be able to obtain additional outside financing to fund our operations on favorable terms or at all the impact of a credit rating downgrade to a level below investment grade would result in our breaching provisions in certain of our derivative instruments and may result in a request for immediate payment andor ongoing overnight collateralization on our derivative instruments in liability positions see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for such information a credit rating downgrade would also result in rjf incurring a higher commitment fee on any unused balance on its 300 million revolving credit facility executed on august 6 2015 in addition to triggering a higher interest rate applicable to any borrowings outstanding on the line as of and subsequent to such downgrade see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information on this revolving credit facilitywe are exposed to market riskwe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions market risk generally represents the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions for example interest rate changes could adversely affect our net interest spread the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding which in turn impacts our net interest income and earnings interest rate changes could affect the interest earned on assets differently than interest paid on liabilities in our brokerage operations a rising interest rate environment generally results in our earning a larger net interest spread conversely in those operations a falling interest rate environment generally results in our earning a smaller net interest spread if we are unable to effectively manage our interest rate risk changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our profitabilitymarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans deposits securities shortterm borrowings longterm debt trading account assets and liabilities derivatives and venture capital and private equity investments market conditions that change from time to time thereby exposing us to market risk include fluctuations in interest rates equity prices relative exchange rates and price deterioration or changes in value due to changes in market perception or actual credit quality of an issuerin addition disruptions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may result in our inability to sell syndicate or realize the value of security positions thereby leading to increased concentrations the inability to reduce our positions in specific securities may not only increase the market and credit risks associated with such positions but also increase the level of riskweighted assets on our balance sheet thereby increasing our capital requirements which could have an adverse effect on our business results financial condition and liquidityour venture capital and private equity investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in earnings the value of our private equity portfolios can fluctuate and earnings from our venture capital investments can be volatile and difficult to predict when and if we recognize gains can depend on a number of factors including general economic conditions the prospects of the companies in which we invest when these companies go public the size of our position relative to the public float and whether we are subject to any resale restrictions further our investments could incur significant marktomarket losses especially if they have been written up in prior periods because of higher market prices see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing market riskwe are exposed to credit riskwe are generally exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money securities or other assets will fail to meet their performance obligations due to numerous causes including bankruptcy lack of liquidity or operational failure among others we actively buy and sell securities from and to clients and counterparties in the normal course of our brokerdealers market making and underwriting businesses which exposes us to credit risk although generally collateralized by the underlying security to the transaction we still face risk associated with changes in the market value of collateral through settlement date we also hold 18indexcertain securities loans and derivatives in our trading accounts deterioration in the actual or perceived credit quality of the underlying issuers of securities or loans or the nonperformance of issuers and counterparties to certain derivative contracts could result in trading losses we borrow securities from and lend securities to other brokerdealers and may also enter into agreements to repurchase andor resell securities as part of investing and financing activities a sharp change in the security market values utilized in these transactions may result in losses if counterparties to these transactions fail to honor their commitmentswe manage the risk associated with these transactions by establishing and monitoring credit limits as well as by monitoring collateral and transaction levels daily significant deterioration in the credit quality of one of our counterparties could lead to widespread concerns about the credit quality of other counterparties in the same industry thereby exacerbating our credit risk exposure we permit our clients to purchase securities on margin during periods of steep declines in securities prices the value of the collateral securing client margin loans may fall below the amount of the purchasers indebtedness if clients are unable to provide additional collateral for these margin loans we may incur losses on those margin transactions this may cause us to incur additional expenses defending or pursuing claims or litigation related to counterparty or client defaults we deposit our cash in depository institutions as a means of maintaining the liquidity necessary to meet our operating needs and we also facilitate the deposit of cash awaiting investment in depository institutions on behalf of our clients a failure of a depository institution to return these deposits could severely impact our operating liquidity result in significant reputational damage and adversely impact our financial performancewe also incur credit risk by lending to businesses and individuals through the offering of campi loans commercial and residential mortgage loans taxexempt loans home equity lines of credit and margin and other loans collateralized by securities we incur credit risk through our investments our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our loans or investments are concentrated among borrowers or issuers engaged in the same or similar activities industries or geographies or to borrowers or issuers who as a group may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or market conditions the deterioration of an individually large exposure for example due to natural disasters health emergencies or pandemics acts of terrorism severe weather events or other adverse economic events could lead to additional loan loss provisions andor chargesoffs or credit impairment of our investments and subsequently have a material impact on our net income and regulatory capital declines in the real estate market or sustained economic downturns may cause us to write down the value of some of the loans in rj banks portfolio foreclose on certain real estate properties or write down the value of some of our available for sale securities portfolio credit quality generally may also be affected by adverse changes in the financial performance or condition of our debtors or deterioration in the strength of the us economy our policies also can adversely affect borrowers potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans or satisfy their obligations to us see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches to managing credit riskthe soundness of other financial institutions and intermediaries affects uswe face the risk of operational failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the clearing agents exchanges clearing houses or other financial intermediaries that we use to facilitate our securities transactions as a result of the consolidation over the years among clearing agents exchanges and clearing houses our exposure to certain financial intermediaries has increased and could affect our ability to find adequate and costeffective alternatives should the need arise any failure termination or constraint of these intermediaries could adversely affect our ability to execute transactions service our clients and manage our exposure to risk our ability to engage in routine trading and funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading clearing funding counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients defaults by or even rumors or questions about the financial condition of one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have historically led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us 19indexcannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us losses arising in connection with counterparty defaults may have a material adverse effect on our results of operationsour business depends on fees generated from the distribution of financial products fees earned from the management of client accounts by our asset management subsidiaries and advisory feesa large portion of our revenues are derived from fees generated from the distribution of financial products such as mutual funds and variable annuities changes in the structure or amount of the fees paid by the sponsors of these products could directly affect our revenues business and financial condition in addition if these products experience losses or increased investor redemptions we may receive lower fee revenue from the investment management and distribution services we provide on behalf of the mutual funds and annuities the investment management fees we are paid may also decline over time due to factors such as increased competition renegotiation of contracts and the introduction of new lowerpriced investment products and services changes in market values or in the fee structure of asset management accounts would affect our revenues business and financial condition asset management fees often are primarily comprised of base management and incentive fees management fees are primarily based on assets under management aum aum balances are impacted by net inflowoutflow of client assets and market values belowmarket investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could result in a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult to attract new investors and thus further impact our business and financial condition if we were to experience the loss of managed accounts our fee revenue would decline in addition in periods of declining market values our asset values under management may resultantly decline which would negatively impact our fee revenuesour underwriting marketmaking trading and other business activities place our capital at riskwe may incur losses and be subject to reputational harm to the extent that for any reason we are unable to sell securities which we have underwritten at the anticipated price levels as an underwriter we also are subject to heightened standards regarding liability for material misstatements or omissions in prospectuses and other offering documents relating to offerings in which we are involved as a market maker we may own positions in specific securities and these undiversified holdings concentrate the risk of market fluctuations and may result in greater losses than would be the case if our holdings were more diversified in addition despite risk mitigation policies we may incur losses as a result of positions we hold in connection with our market making or underwriting activitiesfrom time to time and as part of our underwriting processes we may carry significant positions in securities of a single issuer or issuers engaged in a specific industry sudden changes in the value of these positions could impact our financial resultswe have made and to the limited extent permitted by applicable regulations may continue to make principal investments in private equity funds and other illiquid investments we may be unable to realize our investment objectives if we cannot sell or otherwise dispose of our interests at attractive prices or complete a desirable exit strategy in particular these risks could arise from changes in the financial condition or prospects of the portfolio companies in which investments are made changes in economic conditions or changes in laws regulations fiscal policies or political conditions it could take a substantial period of time to identify attractive investment opportunities and then to realize the cash value of such investments even if a private equity investment proves to be profitable it may be several years or longer before any profits can be realized in cashwe continue to experience pricing pressures in areas of our business which may impair our future revenue and profitabilitywe continue to experience pricing pressures on trading margins and commissions in fixed income and equity trading in the fixed income market regulatory requirements have resulted in greater price transparency leading to price competition and decreased trading margins in the equity market we experience pricing pressure from institutional clients to reduce commissions and this pressure has been augmented by the use of electronic and direct market access trading which has created additional competitive downward pressure on trading margins we believe that price competition and pricing pressures in these and other areas will continue as institutional investors continue to reduce the amounts they are willing to pay including by reducing the number of brokerage firms they use and some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing fees commissions or marginswe face intense competition we are engaged in intensely competitive businesses we compete on the basis of a number of factors including the quality of our financial advisors and associates our products and services pricing such as execution pricing and fee levels and location and reputation in relevant markets over time there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the 20indexfinancial services industry which has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of our competitors see the section entitled competition of item 1 of this report for additional information about our competitors we compete directly with national full service brokerdealers investment banking firms and commercial banks and to a lesser extent with discount brokers and dealers and investment advisors in addition we face competition from more recent entrants into the market and increased use of alternative sales channels by other firms we also compete indirectly for investment assets with insurance companies real estate firms and hedge funds among others this competition could cause our business to sufferto remain competitive our future success also depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services the inability to develop new products and services or enhance existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our profitability in addition we may incur substantial expenditures to keep pace with the constant changes and enhancements being made in technology including improvements made to internet connectivity networking and telecommunications systemsour ability to attract and retain senior professionals qualified financial advisors and other associates is critical to the continued success of our businessour ability to develop and retain our clients depends on the reputation judgment business generation capabilities and skills of our senior professionals particularly our managing directors and the members of our executive committees as well as employees and financial advisors to compete effectively we must attract retain and motivate qualified professionals including successful financial advisors investment bankers trading professionals portfolio managers and other revenue producing or specialized personnel competitive pressures we experience could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidityturnover in the financial services industry is high the cost of retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably financial industry employers are increasingly offering guaranteed contracts upfront payments and increased compensation these can be important factors in a current employees decision to leave us as well as in a prospective employees decision to join us as competition for skilled professionals in the industry remains intense we may have to devote significant resources to attracting and retaining qualified personnel to the extent we have compensation targets we may not be able to retain our employees which could result in increased recruiting expense or result in our recruiting additional employees at compensation levels that are not within our target range in particular our financial results may be adversely affected by the costs we incur in connection with any upfront loans or other incentives we may offer to newly recruited financial advisors and other key personnel if we were to lose the services of any of our investment bankers senior equity research sales and trading professionals asset managers or executive officers to a competitor or otherwise we may not be able to retain valuable relationships and some of our clients could choose to use the services of a competitor instead of our services if we are unable to retain our senior professionals or recruit additional professionals our reputation business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected further new business initiatives and efforts to expand existing businesses generally require that we incur compensation and benefits expense before generating additional revenuesmoreover companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that those competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices we have been subject to several such claims and may be subject to additional claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel some of whom may work for our competitors some of these claims may result in material litigation we could incur substantial costs in defending against these claims regardless of their merits such claims could also discourage potential employees who work for our competitors from joining usbusiness growth could increase costs and regulatory and integration risksintegrating acquired businesses including for example the september 6 2016 acquisition of the us private client services unit of deutsche bank wealth management alex brown and the august 31 2016 acquisition of macdougall macdougall amp mactier inc 3macs as well as providing a platform for new businesses and partnering with other firms involve risks and present financial managerial and operational challenges we may incur significant expense in connection with expanding our existing businesses recruiting financial advisors or making strategic acquisitions or investments our overall profitability would be negatively affected if investments and expenses associated with such growth are not matched or exceeded by the revenues derived from such investments or growthexpansion may also create a need for additional compliance documentation risk management and internal control procedures and often involves hiring additional personnel to address these procedures to the extent such procedures are not adequate or not adhered to with respect to our expanded business or any new business we could be exposed to a material loss or regulatory sanction 21indexmoreover to the extent we pursue acquisitions we may be unable to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms we may be unable to integrate any acquired business into our existing business successfully difficulties we may encounter in integrating an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we may need to raise capital or borrow in order to finance an acquisition which could result in dilution or increased leverage we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or perhaps at all a continued interruption to our telecommunications or data processing systems or the failure to effectively update the technology we utilize could be materially adverse to our businessour businesses rely extensively on data processing and communications systems in addition to better serving clients the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables us to reduce costs adapting or developing our technology systems to meet new regulatory requirements client needs and competitive demands is critical for our business introduction of new technology presents challenges on a regular basis there are significant technical and financial costs and risks in the development of new or enhanced applications including the risk that we might be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our applications to emerging industry standardsour continued success depends in part upon our ability to i successfully maintain and upgrade the capability of our technology systems ii address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that satisfy their demands and iii retain skilled information technology employees failure of our technology systems which could result from events beyond our control or an inability to effectively upgrade those systems or implement new technologydriven products or services could result in financial losses liability to clients violations of applicable privacy and other applicable laws and regulatory sanctions see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational riskssecurity breaches of our technology systems or those of our clients or other thirdparty vendors we rely on could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputationthe expectations of sound operational and informational security practices have risen among our clients and vendors the public at large and regulators our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions cyberattacks and breakdowns our operations rely on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks although cyber security incidents among financial services firms are on the rise we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks or other information security breaches however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future despite our implementation of protective measures and endeavoring to modify them as circumstances warrant our computer systems software and networks may be vulnerable to human error natural disasters power loss spam attacks unauthorized access distributed denial of service attacks computer viruses and other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on the security and stability of our operations notwithstanding the precautions we take if one or more of these events were to occur this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain including that of our clients and counterparties which is processed stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and networks or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or the operations of our clients and counterparties we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures or to make required notifications we may also be subject to litigation and financial losses that are neither insured nor covered under any of our current insurance policies a technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulatorsin providing services to clients we may manage utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or employee data including personal data as a result we may be subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect this information such as us federal and state laws governing the protection of personally identifiable information and international laws these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number if any person including any of our associates negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to client or employee data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data we could be subject to significant monetary damages regulatory enforcement actions fines andor criminal prosecution in addition unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or employee data whether through system failure employee negligence fraud or misappropriation could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients and related revenue potential liability in the event of a security breach of client data could be significant depending on the circumstances giving rise to the breach this liability may not be subject to a contractual limit or an exclusion of consequential or indirect damages22indexsee item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for additional information regarding our exposure to and approaches for managing these types of operational risksassociate misconduct which is difficult to detect and deter could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain clients and subject us to significant legal liability and reputational harmthere have been a number of highlypublicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by associates in the financial services industry there is a risk that our associates could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business for example our banking business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to our clients if our associates were to improperly use or disclose confidential information provided by our clients we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position current client relationships and ability to attract future clients we are also subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business in addition our financial advisors may act in a fiduciary capacity providing financial planning investment advice and discretionary asset management the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our associates would adversely affect our clients and us it is not always possible to deter associate misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective if our associates engage in misconduct our business would be adversely affected our operations could be adversely affected by serious weather conditionscertain of our principal operations are located in st petersburg florida while we have a business continuity plan that permits significant operations to be conducted out of our southfield michigan and memphis tennessee locations and our information systems processing to be conducted out of our information technology data

litigation often may be difficult to assess or quantify and the existence and magnitude of potential claims often remain unknown for substantial periods of time unauthorized or illegal acts of our associates could result in substantial liability our private client group business segment has historically been more susceptible to litigation than our institutional businesses in highly volatile markets the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions has historically increased these risks include potential liability under securities laws or other laws for alleged materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings and other transactions issues related 23indexto the suitability of our investment recommendations the inability to sell or redeem securities in a timely manner during adverse market conditions contractual issues employment claims and potential liability for other advice we provide to participants in strategic transactions substantial legal liability could have a material adverse financial impact or cause us significant reputational harm which in turn could seriously harm our business and future business prospects in addition to the foregoing financial costs and risks associated with potential liability the costs of defending individual litigation and claims continue to increase over time the amount of outside attorneys fees incurred in connection with the defense of litigation and claims could be substantial and might materially and adversely affect our results of operationssee item 3 legal proceedings in this report for a discussion of our legal matters and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report for a discussion regarding our approach to managing legal riskthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results and new accounting standards could adversely affect future reported resultsthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period such estimates and assumptions may require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain one of our most critical estimates is rj banks allowance for loan losses at any given point in time conditions in the real estate and credit markets may increase the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in rj banks loan portfolio if managements underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate one outcome could be that the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses our financial condition including our liquidity and capital and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationscritical accounting estimates in this report for additional information on the nature of these estimatesour financial instruments including certain trading assets and liabilities available for sale securities including auction rate securities ars certain loans intangible assets and private equity investments among other items require management to make a determination of their fair value in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements where quoted market prices are not available we may make fair value determinations based on internally developed models or other means which ultimately rely to some degree on our subjective judgment some of these instruments and other assets and liabilities may have no direct observable inputs making their valuation particularly subjective and consequently based on significant estimation and judgment in addition sudden illiquidity in markets or declines in prices of certain securities may make it more difficult to value certain items which may lead to the possibility that such valuations will be subject to further change or adjustment as well as declines in our earnings in subsequent periods our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations the financial accounting standards board the fasb and the sec have at times revised the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret the accounting standards may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations in some cases we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively resulting in our restating prior period financial statements for further discussion of some of our significant accounting policies and standards see the critical accounting estimates discussion within item 7 in this report and note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10kin june 2016 the fasb issued a new standard on accounting for credit losses the new standard will replace multiple existing impairment models including the replacement of the incurred loss model for loans with an expected loss model we are evaluating the potential impact its adoption which will occur no later than the quarter ended december 31 2020 will have on our financial position and results of operations our risk management and conflicts of interest policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated riskwe seek to manage monitor and control our operational legal and regulatory risk through operational and compliance reporting systems internal controls management review processes and other mechanisms however there can be no assurance that our procedures will be effective our banking and trading processes seek to balance our ability to profit from banking and trading positions with our exposure to potential losses while we use limits and other risk mitigation techniques those techniques and 24indexthe judgments that accompany their application cannot anticipate unforeseen economic and financial outcomes or the specifics and timing of such outcomes our risk management methods may not predict future risk exposures effectively in addition some of our risk management methods are based on an evaluation of information regarding markets clients and other matters that are based on assumptions that may no longer be accurate a failure to manage our growth adequately or to manage our risk effectively could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition financial services firms are subject to numerous actual or perceived conflicts of interest which are under growing scrutiny by us federal and state regulators our risk management processes include addressing potential conflicts of interest that arise in our business management of potential conflicts of interest has become increasingly complex as we expand our business activities a perceived or actual failure to address conflicts of interest adequately could affect our reputation the willingness of clients to transact business with us or give rise to litigation or regulatory actions therefore there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause result in material harm to our business and financial condition for more information on how we monitor and manage market and certain other risks see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this reportwe are exposed to risk from international marketswe do business in other parts of the world including a few developing regions commonly known as emerging markets and as a result are exposed to risks including economic market litigation and regulatory risks our businesses and revenues derived from nonus operations are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations social or political instability less established regulatory regimes changes in governmental or central bank policies downgrades in the credit ratings of sovereign countries expropriation nationalization confiscation of assets and unfavorable legislative economic and political developments action or inaction in any of these operations including failure to follow proper practices with respect to regulatory compliance andor corporate governance could harm our operations and our reputation we also invest or trade in the securities of corporations located in nonus jurisdictions revenues from trading nonus securities also may be subject to negative fluctuations as a result of the abovementioned factors the impact of these fluctuations could be magnified because nonus trading markets particularly those in emerging markets are generally smaller and less developed less liquid and more volatile than us trading marketswe have risks related to our insurance programsour operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our use of a combination of insurance selfinsured retention and selfinsurance for a number of risks including most significantly property and casualty workers compensation errors and omissions liability general liability and the portion of employeerelated health care benefits plans we fund while we endeavor to purchase insurance coverage appropriate to our risk assessment we are unable to predict with certainty the frequency nature or magnitude of claims for direct or consequential damages our business may be negatively affected if our insurance proves to be inadequate or unavailable in addition insurance claims may divert management resources away from operating our businessrisks related to our regulatory environmentfinancial services firms have been subject to increased regulatory scrutiny over the last several years increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actionsfinancial services firms have been operating in an onerous regulatory environment which will become even more stringent in light of recent wellpublicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud the industry has experienced increased scrutiny from various regulators including the sec the fed the occ and the cfpb in addition to stock exchanges finra and state attorneys general penalties and fines imposed by regulatory authorities have increased substantially in recent years we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws rules and regulations each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many different aspects of financial services including but not limited to the authority to fine us and to grant cancel restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to continue operating particular businesses or engage in certain activities substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action taken against us could harm our business prospects through adverse financial effects and reputational harm25indexchanges in regulations resulting from the doddfrank act the dol rules including the new fiduciary standard or any new regulations or laws may adversely affect our businessesmarket and economic conditions over the past several years have directly led to a demand by the public for changes in the way the financial services industry is regulated including a call for more stringent legislation and regulation in the united states and abroad the doddfrank act enacted sweeping changes and an unprecedented increase in the supervision and regulation of the financial services industry see item 1 regulation in this report for a discussion of such changes the ultimate impact that the doddfrank act and implementing regulations will have on us the financial industry and the economy at large cannot be quantified until all of the implementing regulations called for under the legislation have been finalized and fully implemented nevertheless it is apparent that these legislative and regulatory changes could affect our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunities impact the value of our assets require us to alter at least some of our business practices impose additional compliance costs and otherwise adversely affect our businessesthe doddfrank act impacts the manner in which we market our products and services manage our business and operations and interact with regulators all of which could materially impact our results of operations financial condition and liquidity certain provisions of the doddfrank act that have or may impact our businesses include the establishment of a fiduciary standard for brokerdealers regulatory oversight of incentive compensation the imposition of capital requirements on financial holding companies restrictions on proprietary trading and to a lesser extent greater oversight over derivatives trading there is also increased regulatory scrutiny and related compliance costs as we continue to grow and surpass certain consolidated asset thresholds established under the doddfrank act which have the effect of imposing enhanced standards and requirements on larger institutions these include but are not limited to rj banks oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has had an active enforcement agenda and any action taken by the cfpb could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected products and services make such products and services less attractive impose additional compliance measures or result in fines penalties or required remediation to the extent the doddfrank act impacts the operations financial condition liquidity and capital requirements of unaffiliated financial institutions with whom we transact business those institutions may seek to pass on increased costs reduce their capacity to transact or otherwise present inefficiencies in their interactions with us we were required to comply with the volcker rules provisions beginning on july 21 2015 although we have not historically engaged in significant levels of proprietary trading due to our underwriting and market making activities the volcker rule will likely adversely affect our results of operations through increased operational and compliance costs possible reductions in our trading revenues and changes to our private equity investmentswe are evaluating the impact of the dol rule on our business however because qualified accounts particularly ira accounts comprise a significant portion of our business we expect that implementation of the dol rule will negatively impact our results including the impact of increased costs related to compliance legal and information technology in addition we expect that our legal risks will increase in part as a result of the new contractual rights required to be given to ira and nonerisa plan clients under the bic exemption and principal transactions exemptionthe basel iii regulatory capital standards impose additional capital and other requirements on us that could decrease our competitiveness and profitabilityin july 2013 the fed the occ and the fdic released final us basel iii rules which implemented the global regulatory capital reforms of basel iii and certain changes required by the doddfrank act the us basel iii rules increase the quantity and quality of regulatory capital establish a capital conservation buffer and make selected changes to the calculation of riskweighted assets we became subject to the requirements under the final us basel iii rules as of january 1 2015 subject to a phasein period for several of its provisions including the new minimum capital ratio requirements the capital conservation buffer and the regulatory capital adjustments and deductions the increased capital requirements stipulated under the us basel iii rules could restrict our ability to grow during favorable market conditions or require us to raise additional capital as a result our business results of operations financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected we continue to evaluate the impact of the us basel iii rules on both rj bank and rjffailure to comply with regulatory capital requirements primarily applicable to rjf rj bank or our brokerdealer subsidiaries would significantly harm our businessrjf and rj bank are subject to various regulatory and capital requirements administered by various federal regulators in the united states and accordingly must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of rjf and rj banks assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices the capital amounts and classification for both rjf and rj bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by u s federal regulators based on components of our capital riskweightings of assets offbalance sheet transactions and other factors quantitative measures established by 26indexregulation to ensure capital adequacy require rjf and rj bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of common equity tier 1 tier 1 and total capital to riskweighted assets tier 1 capital to average assets and capital conservation buffers as defined in the regulations failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and potentially additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could harm either rjf or rj banks operations and financial condition as more fully discussed in item 1 regulation in this report rjf is required to perform annual stress tests using certain scenarios provided by the fed while we believe that both the quality and magnitude of our capital base is sufficient to support our current operations given our risk profile the results of the stress testing process may affect our approach to managing and deploying capitalwe are subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule 15c31 and finras net capital rule which may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from our brokerdealer subsidiaries the uniform net capital rule sets the minimum level of net capital that a brokerdealer must maintain and also requires that a portion of its assets be relatively liquid finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying cash dividends if resulting net capital falls below certain thresholds in addition our canadabased brokerdealer subsidiary is subject to similar limitations under applicable regulation in that jurisdiction by iiroc regulatory capital requirements applicable to some of our significant subsidiaries may impede access to funds that rjf needs to make payments on any such obligationssee note 25 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further information on regulations and capital requirementsas a financial holding company rjfs liquidity depends on payments from its subsidiaries which may be subject to regulatory restrictionsrjf is a financial holding company and therefore depends on dividends

its common stock the federal banking regulators including the occ the fed and the fdic as well as the sec through finra have the authority and under certain circumstances the obligation to limit or prohibit dividend payments and stock repurchases by the banking organizations they supervise including rjf and its bank subsidiaries see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources in this report for additional information on liquidity and how we manage our liquidity riskwe operate in a highly regulated industry in which future developments could adversely affect our business and financial conditionthe securities industry is subject to extensive and constantly changing regulation brokerdealers and investment advisors are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business including but not limited to sales and trading methods trade practices among brokerdealers use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities capital structure of securities firms antimoney laundering efforts recordkeeping and the conduct of directors officers and employees any violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to the following events any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and prospects civil and criminal liability sanctions which could include the revocation of our subsidiaries registrations as investment advisors or brokerdealers the revocation of the licenses of our financial advisors censures fines or a temporary suspension or permanent bar from conducting business the majority of our affiliated financial advisors are independent contractors legislative or regulatory action that redefines the criteria for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor could materially impact our relationships with our advisors and our business resulting in an adverse effect on our results of operationsas a financial holding company we are regulated by the fed rj bank is regulated by the occ the fed the cfpb and the fdic this oversight includes but is not limited to scrutiny with respect to affiliate transactions and compliance with consumer regulations the economic and political environment over the past several years has resulted in increased focus on the regulation of the financial services industry including many proposals for new rules any new rules issued by us regulators that oversee the financial services industry could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we also may be adversely affected as a result of changes to federal state or foreign tax laws or by changes to the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 27indexregulatory actions brought against us may result in judgments settlements fines penalties or other results any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations there is no assurance that regulators will be satisfied with the policies and procedures implemented by rjf and its subsidiaries in addition from time to time rjf and its affiliates may become subject to additional findings with respect to compliance or other regulatory deficiencies which could subject us to additional liability including penalties see item 1 regulation in this report for additional information regarding our regulatory environment and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this report regarding our approaches to managing regulatory risk numerous regulatory changes and enhanced regulatory and enforcement activity relating to the asset management business may increase our compliance and legal costs and otherwise adversely affect our businessthe sec has proposed certain measures that would establish a new framework to replace the requirements of rule 12b1 under the 1940 act with respect to how mutual funds pay fees to cover the costs of selling and marketing their shares the staff of the secs office of compliance inspections and examinations has indicated that it is reviewing the use of fund assets to pay for fees to subtransfer agents and subadministrators for services that may be deemed to be distributionrelated any adoption of such measures would be phased in over a number of years as these measures are neither final nor undergoing implementation throughout the financial services industry their impact cannot be fully ascertained at this time as this regulatory trend continues it could adversely affect our operations and in turn our financial results asset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds investment advisors and brokerdealers as some of our wholly owned subsidiaries are registered as investment advisors with the sec increased regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in augmented operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities it is not possible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law conformance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business for example pursuant to the doddfrank act the sec was charged with considering whether brokerdealers should be subject to a standard of care similar to the fiduciary standard applicable to registered investment advisors it is not clear whether the sec will determine that a heightened standard of conduct is appropriate for brokerdealers however any such standard if mandated would likely require us to review our product and service offerings and implement certain changes as well as require that we incur additional regulatory costs in order to ensure compliancein addition us and foreign governments have recently taken regulatory actions impacting the investment management industry and may continue to take further actions including expanding current or enacting new standards requirements and rules that may be applicable to us and our subsidiaries for example several states and municipalities in the united states have adopted paytoplay rules which could limit our ability to charge advisory fees such paytoplay rules could affect the profitability of that portion of our business additionally the use of soft dollars where a portion of commissions paid to brokerdealers in connection with the execution of trades also pays for research and other services provided to advisors is periodically reexamined and may be limited or modified in the future a substantial portion of the research relied on by our investment management business in the investment decision making process is generated internally by our investment analysts and external research including external research paid for with soft dollars this external research generally is used for information gathering or verification purposes and includes brokerprovided research as well as thirdparty provided databases and research services if the use of soft dollars is limited we may have to bear some of these additional costs furthermore new regulations regarding the management of hedge funds and the use of certain investment products may impact our investment management business and result in increased costs for example many regulators around the world adopted disclosure and reporting requirements relating to the hedge fund business or other businesses and changes to the laws rules and regulations in the united states related to the overthecounter swaps and derivatives markets require additional registration recordkeeping and reporting obligationsrj bank is subject to the community reinvestment act and fair

relief andor require us to undertake remedial actionswe cannot predict if how or when such proceedings or investigations will be resolved or what the eventual settlement fine penalty or other relief if any may be a large number of factors may contribute to this inherent unpredictability the proceeding is in its early stages the damages sought are unspecified unsupported or uncertain it is unclear
