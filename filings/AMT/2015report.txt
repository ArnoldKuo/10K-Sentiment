corporation and its predecessor as applicable individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires    iii    table of contents part i      item 1 business  overview  we are a global independent owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 through our network development services business we offer towerrelated services domestically which primarily support our site leasing business  our communications real estate portfolio of 75594 communications sites as of december 31 2014 includes 28566 communications towers domestically 46598 communications towers internationally and 430 distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures  on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement with verizon communications inc verizon pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites for 5056 billion in cash at closing the proposed verizon transaction subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments  we operate as a reit and therefore are generally not subject to us federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing space on our towers however even as a reit we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable reit subsidiaries trss in addition our international assets and operations including those designated as direct or indirect qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a reit collectively qrss continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be treated as qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss during the year ended december 31 2014 we restructured certain of our german subsidiaries and certain of our domestic trss which included a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business to be treated as qrss as a result as of december 31 2014 our qrss include our domestic tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business  our continuing operations are reported in three segments i domestic rental and management ii international rental and management and iii network development services for more information about our    1    table of contents  business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 98 and 97 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable tenyear term with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage approximately 30 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn has been approximately 1 to 2 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our cash revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period cash rental and management segment revenue            high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through and shared across our tenant base            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites  our rental and management operations include the operation of communications towers managed networks the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65 65 and 67 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively    2    table of contents our international rental and management segment which consists of communications sites in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda provides a source of growth and diversification including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development in november 2014 we expanded our global footprint by signing an agreement to acquire over 4800 communications sites in nigeria our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33 33 and 30 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  communications towers approximately 95 96 and 96 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio mobile video and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 84 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2014            international telefónica in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany mexico and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda nextel international in brazil chile and mexico grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico acquired by atampt in january 2015 and vodafone in germany ghana india and south africa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 57 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states brazil chile colombia ghana india and mexico we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states typically we design build and operate our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate infrastructure such as small cell deployment that may support our tenants networks in these areas            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements    3    table of contents         shared generators we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators  network development services  through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services network development services primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades this segment accounted for approximately 2 2 and 3 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in the united states and in our international markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the buildout of fourth generation 4g networks while our international markets are in various stages of network development as of december 31 2014 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites    4    table of contents         invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs new site construction and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by pursuing such investments in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve upon our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis            maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to our disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade ratings we remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth we continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and as of december 31 2014 had approximately 27 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio  capital allocation strategy  the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt as necessary to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range            capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our riskadjusted return on investment criteria our riskadjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk            return excess capital to stockholders if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii our capital expenditures iii repayment of debt as necessary to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and iv anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders  during 2014 we generated 21 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund 19 billion of investments including 10 billion of acquisitions and 9744 million of capital expenditures in addition in 2014 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4046 million to our common stockholders and approximately 160 million to our preferred stockholders  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be    5    table of contents  achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime            wireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market such as the pricing environment past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur is being or will be deployed            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  recent transactions  acquisitions  from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 8450 sites including approximately 3133 buildtosuits and we believe the assets constructed and acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins significant acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 included the acquisition of i 100 of the equity interests of br towers sa a brazilian telecommunications real estate company br towers which at closing owned or held exclusive use rights for 4617 towers and 47 property interests in brazil and ii entities holding a portfolio of 59 communications sites which at the time of acquisition were leased primarily to radio and television broadcast tenants and four property interests in the united states from richland properties llc and other related entities richland  in addition during the fourth quarter of 2014 we signed definitive agreements to acquire approximately 11280 additional communications sites in brazil and nigeria and in february 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states  we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  financing transactions  during the year ended december 31 2014 to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio we strengthened our balance sheet by completing a number of    6    table of contents  key financing initiatives including those set forth below for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements

the maturity date to january 31 2020 as a result as of december 31 2014 we had the ability to borrow up to 24 billion under our existing credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit   regulatory matters  towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 66 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the

and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations  portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure    8    table of contents competition  we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure limited wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project   customer demand  our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged over 30 billion over the past three years resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            increasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks            subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile internet and video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments and            the increasing availability of lower cost smartphones internationally    9    table of contents we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites  in addition our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  employees  as of december 31 2014 we employed 2974 fulltime individuals

operating results and we cannot control that demand  factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include            increased use of network sharing without compensation to us roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers            mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers            zoning environmental health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof            governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses            a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors including inflation            the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure            the financial condition of wireless service providers            delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies and            technological changes  any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed  increasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our pricing  our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates    11    table of contents  we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter new leases it may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where the majority of our leases include fixed escalators our income would be adversely affected increasing competition for tenants or significant increases in inflation rates could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  competition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteria  we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply lower investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do  our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle an existing tower zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition furthermore some foreign jurisdictions have implemented regulations governing investment funds or their managers which may be interpreted to apply to reits and there is uncertainty as to the interpretation and implementation of these regulations  our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us  our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  our leverage could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition including            impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if an uncured default occurs    12    table of contents         increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline            placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets            limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures reit distributions and preferred stock dividends            requiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations            limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete and            limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders  in addition to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable and the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage  failure to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired or leased assets including from the proposed verizon transaction the verizon assets into our operations may adversely affect our business operations and financial condition  integrating acquired portfolios of communications sites may require significant resources as well as attention from our management team in addition we may incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of acquired or leased assets or businesses into our operations further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid for example the integration of the verizon assets which includes up to 11489 towers into our operations will be a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with the integration of the verizon assets into our operations including costs for tasks such as tower visits and audits and ground and tenant lease verifications additional integration challenges include            transitioning all data related to the verizon assets tenants and landlords to a common information technology system            successfully marketing space on the verizon assets            successfully transitioning the ground lease rent payment and the tenant billing and collection processes            retaining existing tenants on the verizon assets and            maintaining our standards controls procedures and policies with respect to the verizon assets  additionally we may fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity if we are not able to meet these integration challenges we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and businesses including the proposed verizon transaction and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected    13    table of contents our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk  as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel  furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the risk factor immediately below some of which may require additional resources and personnel  in addition as a result of prior acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is made  our expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including            changes to existing or new tax laws or methodologies impacting our international operations or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions any of which may be applied or enforced retroactively            laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital            changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation            changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications sites            expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture            actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending or terminating business under prior licenses    14    table of contents         failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws or office of foreign assets control requirements            material site security issues            significant license surcharges            increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise power and other goods and services required for our operations            price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of passive infrastructure and            uncertain or inconsistent laws regulations rulings or results from legal or judicial systems which may be enforced retroactively and delays in the judicial process  we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income  in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities  in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants  a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy  in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise    15    table of contents  adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  new technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues  the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available  effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply  qualification as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified as a reit or the benefits of remaining so qualified there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code  if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code            we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income            we will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and            we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified  any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some    16    table of contents  investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reduced  furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc mipt we own an interest in a subsidiary reit the subsidiary reit is independently subject to and must comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii the subsidiary reit will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost iii our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we will fail to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisions  complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities  our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy  specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing  further as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investments  in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements  certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities  we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes any of these taxes decrease our earnings and our available cash    17    table of contents we are also subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability  our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located  we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities asset sales or equity issuances we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements  if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results  our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases and the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2024 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated  our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each

adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if we fail to pay scheduled dividends on our preferred stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit  the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets  the agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts  further

owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes    28    table of contents the following table details the number of communications sites excluding managed sites we owned or operated

options    2 in september 2014 we completed the sale of the operations in panama  on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states for 5056 billion in cash at closing subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments  the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2014 we expect to generate approximately 27 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 30 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs  the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented approximately 15 of our rental and management operations revenues  rental and management operations revenue growth due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant remaining tower capacity and    29    table of contents  tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation  the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segments are            recurring organic revenue which is revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites            contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of cancellations            new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy sites and            new revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites  we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition consistent with our signing of a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and in new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in a majority of our international markets revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs  rental and management operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth            domestic as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites  based on industry research and projections we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us            the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks            wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their    30    table of contents       existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage            wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of onsite generators which typically results in additional equipment or space leased at the tower site and incremental revenue            wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration  we have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites            international as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as mtn group limited telefónica sa vodafone group plc and bharti airtel limited we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward  in emerging markets such as ghana india and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate  in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on third generation 3g network build outs and augmentations with select initial investments in fourth generation 4g technology recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service  finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with a more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity  we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 46700 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growth    31    table of contents rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2014 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8450 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio                     new sites acquired or constructed   2014     2013     2012

domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities  network development services segment revenue growth as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues

replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap neither nareit ffo nor affo represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 5 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies  our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo may not however be fully

the outstanding 4625 notes in accordance with the terms thereof    11 includes payments under noncancellable initial terms as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases    12 primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet primarily our straightline rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash    13 excludes 266 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and 249 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positions  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk  interest rate swap agreements we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 799 million interest rates ranging from 574 to 783 and expiration dates through april 2021 in february 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements additionally in connection with entering into the colombian credit facility in october 2014 we terminated our preexisting interest rate    56    table of contents  swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 1000 billion cop approximately 418 million  factors affecting sources of liquidity  our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity  internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2014 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites  restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the 2013 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to i total leverage ii senior secured leverage and iii interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with each of these covenants  consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 600 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 17 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 291 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio on february 20 2015 we entered into amendments to the 2013 term loan 2013 credit facility and 2014 credit facility pursuant to which this ratio will be increased upon the closing of the proposed verizon transaction  consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 45 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 17 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 15 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio  interest coverage ratio in the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade we will be required to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 our interest expense which was 549 million for that period could increase by approximately 532 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 13 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio    57    table of contents the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants  any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants  restrictions under agreements relating to the securitization and the gtp notes the first amended and restated loan and security agreement related to the securitization the loan agreement and indentures governing the gtp notes the gtp indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc the borrowers and the gtp issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture  under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the securitization the loan or the gtp notes as applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes are released to the borrowers or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by us during the year ended december 31 2014 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of 7157 million and the gtp issuers have distributed excess cash to us of 1641 million  in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers and the gtp issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio dscr calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees if the dscr with respect to the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in our securitization the securities or any series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners is equal to or below 130x the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of securities or gtp notes under the loan agreement or gtp indentures as applicable will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the borrowers or the gtp issuers the funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the borrowers or gtp partners for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of securities or gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters likewise the funds in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular sites for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar months    58    table of contents additionally an amortization period commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites if the dscr of such series equals or falls below 115x the minimum dscr the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters similarly the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar months  if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the securities has not been paid in full an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of securities is repaid in full  during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of securities or series of gtp notes on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the securities or series of gtp notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or the gtp indentures as applicable  consequently a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers or gtp issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements make mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend payments and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrowers were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the 5195 wireless and broadcast communications towers that secure the loan the secured towers in which case we could lose the secured towers and the revenue associated with those towers in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp notes declare such series of gtp notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such gtp notes furthermore if the gtp issuers were to default on a series of the gtp notes the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the 2845 towers and 1035 property interests and other related assets that secure the gtp notes the gtp secured sites securing such series of the gtp notes in which case we could lose the gtp secured sites and the revenue associated with those assets  as of december 31 2014 the borrowers dscr was 1022x based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 4286 million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 4358 million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr as of december 31 2014 the dscr of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites were 288x and 254x respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of gtp notes gtp partners and gtp cellular sites could endure a reduction of approximately 687 million and 164 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 752 million and 184 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr  as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital    59    table of contents  through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements pay mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness  in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factors we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2014 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result            impairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable  we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements  we review our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment            impairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable    60    table of contents goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess  during the year ended december 31 2014 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin            asset retirement obligations when required we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located generally the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 132 million during the year ended december 31 2014 the change in 2014 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary            acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with those of the company from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition            revenue recognition our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our    61    table of contents       tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximated 1237 million 1477 million and 1658 million respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met  we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 56 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured            rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured            stockbased compensation the stockbased compensation expense recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets            income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income  we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be    62    table of contents  realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability  we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit  we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states  accounting standards update  for a discussion of recent accounting

growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the company conducts the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess  during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 no

companys strategy to expand in selected geographic areas  the estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period up to one year from the particular acquisition date the primary areas of the accounting for the acquisitions that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed including contingent consideration and residual goodwill and any related tax impact the fair value of these net assets acquired are based on managements estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques while the company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed it will evaluate any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value during the measurement period the company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that if known would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date the effect of measurement period adjustments to the estimated fair value is reflected as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date the impact of all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets or goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods during the year ended december 31 2014 the company made certain
