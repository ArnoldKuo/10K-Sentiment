investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we refer to this business as our services operationsour portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our communications real estate portfolio of 144884 communications sites as of december 31 2016 included 40414 communications sites in the us 57945 communications sites in asia 12861 communications sites in europe middle east and africa emea and 33664 communications sites in latin america american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in 2016 we significantly expanded our asia segment portfolio by acquiring a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom networks limited viom a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india the viom acquisition subsequent to the closing viom was renamed atc telecom infrastructure private limited atc tipl in 2016 we launched operations in argentina a new market for us in december 2016 our newly formed joint venture in europe entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a tower company in france which is also a new market for us this acquisition closed in february 2017we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes reit accordingly we generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries trss in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their designation for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conductedthe use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2016 our reit qualified businesses included our us tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a majority of our services segment and indoor das networks businesswe report our results in five segments  us property

international rental and management and services formerly referred to as network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report1table of contentsproducts and servicesproperty operationsour property operations accounted for 99 98 and 98 of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristicslongterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2016 we expect to generate over 31 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accountingconsistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growthhigh lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn has been approximately 1 to 2 of total property revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our prior year property segment revenuehigh operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or power and fuel costs are reimbursed or shared by our tenant baselow maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sitesour property business includes the operation of communications sites managed networks the leasing of property interests fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the years

sites for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 2table of contentswe lease space on our communications sites to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive additional passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended december 31 2016us atampt verizon wireless sprint and tmobile us accounted for an aggregate of 88 of us property segment revenueasia tata idea cellular vodafone and bharti airtel limited airtel accounted for an aggregate of 66 of asia property segment

aggregate of 71 of latin america property segment revenue accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange ratesmanaged networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites lease fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites managed networks we own and operate das networks in the united states and certain international markets we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states and in certain international markets typically we design build and operate our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions including small cells that may support our tenants networks in these areasproperty interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangementsfiber we own and operate fiber in argentina which we currently lease to operators to support their urban telecommunications infrastructure and expect to lease to operators in the future for additional fourth generation 4g and fifth generation 5g deployments shared generators we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generatorsservices operationswe offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 1 2 and 2 of our total revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectivelysite acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site3table of contentsstructural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third partiesstrategyoperational strategyour operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new and broader opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for additional uses and those that increase our operational efficiency increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and typically have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier network activity is being driven primarily by the buildout and densification of 4g networks while in our international markets carriers are deploying a combination of second generation 2g third generation 3g and 4g networks depending on the specific market as of december 31 2016 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sitesinvest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program new site construction and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by pursuing such investments in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases a significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels and therefore drive strong returns on those assetsfurther improve upon our operational performance and efficiency we continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade credit ratings we continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and as of december 31 2016 had 36 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio capital allocation strategythe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for 4table of contentsdistributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installationsacquisitions we intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our riskadjusted return on investment criteria our riskadjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry riskreturn excess capital to stockholders if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii capital expenditures and iii anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders including through our stock repurchase program international growth strategywe believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among otherscountry analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regimewireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market such as the pricing environment past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctionsopportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the regionrecent transactionsacquisitions and joint venturewe increased our communications site portfolio by 45309 sites in 2016 including 1869 buildtosuits we believe these assets will be an important component of our longterm growth in 2016 we completed the viom acquisition which included approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india we also launched operations in argentina through the acquisition of comunicaciones y consumos sa cycsa which owned or operated urban telecommunications assets fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation in addition we acquired an aggregate of 891 communications sites in the united states brazil chile germany mexico nigeria and south africa in 2016in december 2016 we entered into a joint venture atc europe to which we contributed our german business in exchange for an investment from our partner pggm atc europe will focus on pursuing telecommunications real estate investment opportunities in select countries in europe in december 2016 atc europe entered into a definitive agreement to purchase fps towers fps which owns and operates approximately 2400 wireless tower sites in france this transaction closed on february 15 20175table of contents we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual reportfinancing transactionsduring 2016 to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio while maintaining our longterm financial policies we completed a number of key financing initiatives which among others included the following completing registered public offerings of an aggregate of 325 billion of senior unsecured notes the proceeds of which were used primarily to repay indebtedness under our existing revolving credit facilities and term loan borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were primarily used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposesamending our existing revolving credit facilities and term loan to among other things extend each of the maturity dates by one yearfor more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual reportregulatory matterstowers and antennas our us and international tower leasing business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 59 of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orderscertain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration and permitting in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi ipi registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission ucc which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority ncc which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile cycsa holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the ente nacional de comunicaciones enacom in argentina in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition 6table of contentscertain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownershipin all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites for example there are pending tower marking regulations in the united states compliance with which may result in a substantial increase in our costs environmental matters our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctionsadditionally in the united states and other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayedhealth and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposurecompetitionwe compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sitesour services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project7table of contentscustomer demandour strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our us and international markets while also investing in next generation data networks which will drive demand for our communications sites to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our services operations are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our services will continue consistent with industry trendsus wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our us communications sites is driven byincreasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networkssubscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications particularly mobile video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless datadeployment of newly acquired spectrum anddeployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrantsas consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverageinternational asia emea and latin america wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our us market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven byincumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacityin certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments andthe increasing availability of lower cost smartphonesdemand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsif our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption risk factorsnew technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially

investor relations or by calling us at 617 3757500item 1arisk factorsdecrease in demand for our communications infrastructure would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demanda significant reduction in leasing demand for our communications infrastructure could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition factors that may affect such demand includeincreased use of network sharing or mergers or consolidations among wireless service providerszoning environmental health tax or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereofgovernmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking our tenants spectrum licensesa decrease in consumer demand for wireless services including due to general economic conditions or disruption in the financial and credit marketsthe ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructurethe financial condition of wireless service providersdelays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies andtechnological changesincreasing competition for tenants in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect our revenueour industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases or if we are able to renew or enter into new leases they may be at rates lower than our current rates resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate in addition should inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators our income could be adversely affectedif our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affectedextensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites without compensation to us may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenues certain combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or modernized their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit leases with us or related payments in the event a tenant terminates its business or separately sells its spectrum we may experience increased churn as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed9table of contentsour business is subject to government and tax regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently doour business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing towers at significant costs zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction of communications sites in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction projects associated with our communications sites and new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants in certain jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes in addition in certain jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees which may be subject to substantial increases by the government or new fees may be enacted and apply retroactively furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing our business in jurisdictions where we operate may change at any time perhaps with retroactive effect this includes potential changes in tax laws or the interpretation of tax laws arising out of the base erosion profit shifting or beps project initiated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in addition some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as a reit relative to other reits due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange ratesour international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future exposes us to potential adverse financial and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states we anticipate that revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally includingchanges to existing laws or new laws or methodologies impacting our existing and anticipated international operations fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions any of which laws or fees may be applied retroactively or failure to obtain an expected tax status for which we have appliedexpropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiturelaws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capitalchanges in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluationchanges to zoning regulations or construction laws which could be applied retroactively to our existing communications

gridssignificant increases in or implementation of new license surcharges on our revenueprice setting or other similar laws or regulations for the sharing of passive infrastructure anduncertain or inconsistent laws regulations rulings or results from legal or judicial systems which may be applied retroactively and delays in the judicial processwe also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income10table of contentsin addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint ventureour expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties including those related to integrating acquired or leased assets that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional riskas we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things portfolios without requisite permits differing systems cultural differences and conflicting policies procedures and operations significant acquisitionrelated integration costs including certain nonrecurring charges could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid for example the integration of viom into our operations is a significant undertaking and we anticipate that we will continue to incur certain nonrecurring charges associated with that integration including costs associated with onboarding employees and visiting and upgrading tower sites in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resources including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the assets we acquire or fail to utilize such assets to their full capacity we may not realize the benefits we expect from our acquired portfolios and our business financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as those described in the preceding risk factoras a result of acquisitions we have a substantial amount of intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible assets in the period the determination is madeour expansion initiatives may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditioncompetition for assets could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criteriawe may experience increased competition for the acquisition of assets or contracts to build new communications sites for tenants which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause us to lose contracts to build new sites some of our competitors are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may apply less stringent investment criteria than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering a particular market or competing for the same assets higher prices for assets or the failure to add new assets to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated returns on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial conditionnew technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenuesthe development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may allocate less of their budgets to leasing space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue our failure to innovate in response to the development and 11table of contentsimplementation of these or similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionour leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirementsour leverage and debt service obligations could have significant negative consequences to our business results of operations or financial condition includingrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures reit distributions and preferred stock dividendsimpairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if a default remains uncuredlimiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets andlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we competewe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activities asset sales or equity issuances even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our distribution requirements and debt service obligations an increase in our total leverage could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtednessa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenantsa substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases historically we have resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants a material modification of the terms of those leases or a failure to obtain new business from existing tenants any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditiondue to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants or their parent companies face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcyin our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entitiesin addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturns in the economy or disruptions in the financial and credit markets if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experiences financial difficulties or files for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or tenantrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition12table of contentsif we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may face tax liabilities that impact earnings and available cash flowcommencing with the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we have operated as a reit for federal income tax purposes qualification for taxation as a reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control further tax reform proposals if enacted may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a reit or the benefits or desirability of remaining so qualified there are few judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the codeif in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the codewe will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable incomewe will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates andwe will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualifiedwe are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes while state and local income tax regimes often parallel the us federal income tax regime for reits many of these jurisdictions do not completely follow us federal rules and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdictions currently or in the future may limit or eliminate a reits deduction for dividends paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authorities the results of an audit and examination of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures may have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liabilityour domestic trs assets and operations are subject as applicable to federal and state corporation income taxes our foreign operations whether in the reit or trss are subject to foreign taxes in jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are locatedany corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment operations and distribution would be reducedfurthermore as a result of our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc mipt we owned an interest in a subsidiary reit effective july 25 2015 we filed a tax election pursuant to which mipt no longer operates as a separate reit the statute of limitations is still open for certain years and mipts qualification as a reit could still be challenged as such for all open years we must demonstrate that the subsidiary reit complied with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify as a reit for any of the open years and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would have been subject to federal income tax for such year which tax we would inherit along with applicable penalties and interest ii the subsidiary reit would be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the remaining taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost iii for those years in which the subsidiary reit failed to qualify as a reit our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit would have failed to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may have failed certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we would fail to qualify as a reit for those periods unless we are able to avail ourselves of specified relief provisionscomplying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunitiesour use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets effective january 1 2018 this limitation is reduced to 20 this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the 13table of contentsbusinesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategyspecifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in the united states and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closingfurther as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt as no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders or to use income of our trss to fund other investmentsin addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirementsrestrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities and the terms of our preferred stock could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reitthe agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assetsthe agreements for our credit facilities also contain restrictive covenants and leverage and other financial maintenance tests that could limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders including our required reit distributions and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and

annual reportthe terms of our preferred stock provide that unless full cumulative dividends have been paid or set aside for payment on all outstanding preferred stock for all prior dividend periods no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock a failure to pay dividends on both our preferred and our common stock might jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes even if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit they may prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income making us subject to federal corporate

experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms a significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to longterm operating

purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of acquiring a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial conditionour costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiatedpublic perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and

of the largest global reits and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property

pursuant to longterm capital leases including those subject to purchase options2in argentina we own or operate urban telecommunications assets fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation in general our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of at least ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2016 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2016 we expect to generate over 31 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel coststhe revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination feerevenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations during the year ended december 31 2016 loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 2 of our property operations revenuesproperty operations revenue growth due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expendituresthe primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are27table of contentsgrowth in tenant billings includingnew revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prioryear periodnew revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites colocations and lease amendments andcontractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of churn revenue growth from other items including additional tenant payments to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs passthrough included in certain tenant leases straightline revenue and decommissioningwe continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in our international markets certain passthrough revenue amounts may fluctuate with changing power and fuel costs property operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditionsbased on industry research and projections we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for usin less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks we have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long termsubscribers use of wireless data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration the proliferation of bandwidthintensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem we believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing wireless data usagethe deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networkswireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrumas part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel telefónica sa and vodafone group plc we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward28table of contentsin emerging markets such as ghana india nigeria and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services predominantly on feature phones while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on 3g and 4g network build outs consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices and as a result the usage of bandwidthintensive mobile applications is growing materially recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of servicefinally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and france carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacitywe believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 104470 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growthwe have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent longterm revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn our master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sitesproperty operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2016 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 45310 sites in a majority of our asia emea and latin america markets the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio new sites acquired or constructed2016 2015 2014us65 11595 900asia43865 2330 1560emea665 4910 190latin america715 6535 5800property operations

we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positionsoffbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation skfactors affecting sources of liquidity our liquidity depends upon our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2016 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sitesrestrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these restrictions include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage as set forth in the table below in the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade we must maintain an interest coverage

information to the lenders within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenantsfailure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but may constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based

may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 2015 secured sites or the 2013 secured towers respectively in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assetsas discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital for these purposes we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and debt service obligations pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtednessin addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factors we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity49table of contentscritical accounting policies and estimatesmanagements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditionswe have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2016 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different resultimpairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirementswe review our tenantrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenantrelated intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairmentimpairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverablegoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excessduring the year ended december 31 2016 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount asset retirement obligations when required we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located generally the associated retirement 50table of contentscosts are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 141 million during the year ended december 31 2016 the change in 2016 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessaryacquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition revenue recognition our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total property straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 1317 million 1550 million and 1237 million respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been metwe derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and 56 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assuredrent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured 51table of contentsstockbased compensation the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense in addition the amount we record as stockbased compensation expense is impacted by forfeitures which are accounted for as they occur the fair value of both timebased and performancebased restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we also make certain assumptions regarding performance relative to grant parameters applicable to performancebased restricted stock units which could significantly impact the compensation expense we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assetsincome taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable incomewe periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverabilitywe recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under auditwe consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined

the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of longlived assets including goodwill asset retirement obligations revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation income taxes and accounting for f8table of contentsamerican tower corporation and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial

additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosureaccounts receivable and deferred rent assetthe company derives the largest portion of its revenues corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and 56 of its current year revenues are derived from four tenants the companys deferred rent asset is associated with noncancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable lease in which revenue is recognized on a straightline basis over the lease term the company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of its borrowers and tenants in recognizing tenant revenue the company assesses the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized in advance of billing on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as collectibility is determined to be reasonably assured any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense included in selling general administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operationsaccounts receivable is reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured these allowances are generally estimated based on payment patterns days past due and collection

costs associated with construction of the tower such as transportation costs employee benefits and payroll taxes the company begins the capitalization of costs during the preconstruction period which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant labor costs capitalized for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 were 477 million 447 million and 485 million respectively interest costs capitalized for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014

leases are amortized over the shorter of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the respective assets for periods generally not exceeding twenty yearsthe company reviews its tower portfolio for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues the company reviews other longlived assets for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the companys assets may not be recoverable the company records impairment charges in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the company identifies such impairmentgoodwill and other intangible assetsthe company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverablegoodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level the company utilizes the twostep impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and employs a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the company conducts the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excessduring the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying amountintangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverablethe company reviews its network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment on an individual tower basis impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues the company monitors its tenantrelated intangible assets formerly referred to as customerrelated intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship the company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the related assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows if the company determines that the

company records impairment charges in other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the company identifies such impairmentderivative financial instrumentsderivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in aoci as well as a component of comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings changes in fair value of the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges changes in value of the derivatives are recorded in other expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period along with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occursthe primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk exposure to changes in the fair value of debt attributable to interest rate risk and currency risk from time to time the company enters into interest rate swap agreements or foreign currency contracts to manage exposure to these risks under these agreements the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract the companys exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposesfair value measurementsthe company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asset retirement obligationswhen required the company recognizes the fair value of obligations to remove its tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of its tower assets are located generally the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows with an offsetting adjustment made to the related longlived tangible asset the significant assumptions used in estimating the companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate the companys incremental borrowing rateincome taxesas a reit the company generally is not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by its us reit operations however the company remains obligated to pay us federal income taxes on certain earnings and continues to be subject to taxation in its foreign jurisdictions accordingly the consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal state local and foreign income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the company periodically reviews its deferred tax assets and provides valuation allowances if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverabilitythe company classifies uncertain tax positions as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year the company reports penalties and taxrelated interest expense as a component of the income tax provision and interest income from tax refunds

income lossother comprehensive income loss refers to items excluded from net income that are recorded as an adjustment to equity net of tax the companys other comprehensive income loss primarily consisted of changes in fair value of effective derivative cash flow hedges foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on effective derivative cash flow hedges the aoci balance included foreign currency translation losses of 20 billion 18 billion and 08 billion for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively distributionsas a reit the company must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally the company has distributed and expects to continue to distribute all or substantially all of its reit taxable income after taking into consideration its utilization of net operating losses nols the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon various factors a number of which may be beyond the companys control including the companys financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain its qualification for taxation as a reit and reduce any income and excise taxes that the company otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in the companys existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments the companys ability to utilize nols to offset the companys distribution requirements limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its trss and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevantacquisitionsfor acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination the company applies the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with those of the company from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid by the company over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill the company continues to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired the company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired the company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition revenue recognitionthe companys revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease agreements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index cpi or other inflationbased indices and other incentives

the company over time in addition certain of the companys tenant leases require the company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option the company calculates straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assuredtotal property straightline ground rent expense for the years ended december 31 2016
