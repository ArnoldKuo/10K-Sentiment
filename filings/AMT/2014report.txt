corporation and its predecessor as applicable individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires    iii    table of contents part i      item 1 business  overview  we are a leading independent owner operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites since january 1 2012 we have been organized and have qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  our communications real estate portfolio of 67418 communications sites as of december 31 2013 includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2013 27739 towers domestically and 39330 towers internationally our portfolio also includes 349 das networks in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements and hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in october 2013 we significantly expanded our portfolio through our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc mipt a private reit and parent company to global tower partners gtp an owner and operator of approximately 5370 communications sites through its various operating subsidiaries in the united states costa rica and panama gtp also manages rooftops and holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we believe the acquisition provides us with key strategic and financial advantages due to the high quality of the assets which are in locations complementary to our portfolio for more information on our acquisition of mipt see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda  our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries trss the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include most of our network development services segment in addition we have included most of our international operations and managed networks business within our trss    1    table of contents we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss we changed the previous trs election for certain of our mexican subsidiaries to be treated as qrss as of march 1 2013 in addition we restructured certain of our domestic trss to be treated as qrss as of january 1 2014  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base including the assets acquired as part of our acquisition of mipt which are predominately located in key markets and have minimal overlap with our preexisting sites positions us well to benefit from the increasing demand of global wireless services we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable five to ten year term with multiple fiveyear renewal terms and lease payments that typically increase based on a fixed escalation approximately 3035 per year in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets based upon foreign currency exchange rates and tenant leases in place as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 23 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network churn has been approximately 12 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period rental and management segment revenue            high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through to our tenants            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites    2    table of contents our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enable us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65 67 and 72 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda provides a source of growth and diversification including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33 30 and 26 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators domestically  communications towers approximately 96 96 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 83 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2013            international telefónica in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany mexico panama and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda nextel international in brazil chile and mexico grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico and vodafone in germany ghana india and south africa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 55 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate 349 das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states brazil chile ghana india and mexico we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants and currently operate such networks in the united states typically we design build and operate our das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or    3    table of contents       other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we are also currently evaluating other complementary network strategies such as small cell deployments in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states and certain international markets who own rooftops capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into a contract with a property owner pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid to that property owner by the wireless carriers and other tenants as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate infrastructure that may support our tenants networks in these areas            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements            shared generators we contract with certain of our tenants for the right to use shared backup power generators at a number of our sites in the united states  network development services  through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 2 3 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in the united states and in our international markets has    4    table of contents       resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the buildout of fourth generation 4g networks while our international markets are in various stages of network development as of december 31 2013 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites            invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs and acquisitions such as our acquisition of mipt we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns by pursuing such investments this includes pursuing opportunities to invest in new site construction and acquisitions in our domestic market and in select international markets that we believe have a competitive wireless industry are attractive from a macroeconomic standpoint and have wireless carriers that are actively deploying wireless networks in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve upon our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis in addition our acquisition of mipt provided us with an opportunity to adopt best practices in an effort to further improve the efficiency of our operational performance            maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to our disciplined financial policies which are the foundation of our balance sheet management we believe that these policies result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade ratings our acquisition of mipt resulted in an increase in our total debt and as a result we ended 2013 with our net leverage outside of our longterm target range we remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth we continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and as of december 31 2013 had approximately 23 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio  capital allocation strategy  the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our reit status we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range accordingly we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and acquisitions in addition we intend to return our remaining excess capital if any to stockholders through our stock repurchase program or by declaring special distributions from time to time during 2013 we generated 16 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 52 billion of investments including 45 billion of acquisitions and 7245 million of    5    table of contents  capital expenditures in addition in 2013 we repurchased 1450 million including commissions and fees of our common stock and paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4347 million to our stockholders            capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we will seek to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criteria our risk adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as country risk counterparty risk and product line risk            return excess capital to stockholders if we have sufficient capital available to i satisfy our reit distribution requirements ii fund our capital expenditures iii repay debt to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and iv fund anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return any excess capital to stockholders we typically have utilized a stock repurchase program to facilitate this return  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing independent wireless real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new market we review the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime            wireless industry analysis to ensure sufficient demand to support an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include a country that has multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as deploying incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with a competitive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our risk adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  recent transactions  acquisitions  from january 1 2013 through december 31 2013 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 13070 sites including approximately 2370 buildtosuits and we believe the assets acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013 included            we acquired approximately 880 communications sites in mexico from axtel sab de cv january 2013 approximately 1480 communications sites in mexico from nii holdings inc nii    6    table of contents       november 2013 and approximately 1940 communications sites in brazil from nii december 2013 these acquisitions strengthened our presence in our legacy markets by expanding our site portfolio by nearly 30 in latin america            through our acquisition of approximately 5370 communications sites from mipt in october 2013 we expanded our domestic portfolio by over 20 while also expanding our footprint in latin america the acquisition augmented our presence in the top 100 us btas where carriers have historically been most active in deploying their networks            other acquisitions of an aggregate of approximately 1030 communications sites in brazil chile colombia ghana mexico south africa and the united states  we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  financing transactions  during the year ended december 31 2013 we raised capital thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant financing transactions in 2013 included those set forth below for more information about our financing

towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 67 of our total rental and management    7    table of contents  revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the indian department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership to date such changes have not been formally adopted in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades for instance in june 2012 the chilean government passed legislation retroactively imposing certain zoning restrictions on telecommunications towers in response to which we developed a remediation plan existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations   8    table of contents portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure   competition  we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project  customer demand  our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has increased from approximately 26 billion to over 30 billion over the last three years resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            wireless service provider focus on network quality and resulting investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks    9    table of contents         subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile internet and video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            increasing wireless data usage continues to incentivize carriers to make incremental investments in their data networks            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video and            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments  we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites    10    table of

communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand  factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include            increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers            mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers            governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses            zoning environmental health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof            a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors including inflation            the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure            the financial condition of wireless service providers            delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies and            technological changes  any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to    11    table of contents  widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result our tenants may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements among wireless service providers as an alternative to leasing our communications sites may cause new lease activity to slow if carriers utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing sites because portions of the tenants networks may become redundant in addition significant consolidation among our tenants may materially adversely affect our growth and revenues for example in the united states recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in certain other countries where we do business if consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition certain combined companies have modernized or are currently modernizing their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed  our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do  our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to the construction in their communities which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us  as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 145 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 20 billion under our credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of    12    table of contents  interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business results of operations or financial condition including            impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the towers securing such debt if an uncured default occurs            increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline            placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources including with respect to acquiring assets            limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures or reit distributions            requiring us to issue debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations            limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete and            limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders  in addition to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable and the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage  increasing competition in the tower industry may materially and adversely affect us  we may experience increased competition which could make the acquisition of high quality assets significantly more costly some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do  our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space competitive pricing for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate  the higher prices for assets combined with the competitive pricing pressure on tenant leases could make it more difficult to achieve our return on investment criteria increasing competition for either tower assets or tenants could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel  as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and    13    table of contents  financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on timely and efficiently integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition integrating businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel  furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel and the other risks described immediately below in our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 33 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations compared to 30 for the year ended december 31 2012 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including            changes to existing or new tax laws methodologies impacting our international operations or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions which may be applied or enforced retroactively            laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital            changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation            changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could retroactively be applied to our existing communications sites            expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture            actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending business under prior licenses            potential failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws or office of foreign assets control requirements            material site security issues            significant license surcharges            increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise power and other goods and services required for our operations            price setting or other similar laws for the sharing of passive infrastructure and            uncertain rulings or results from legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies among and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof which may be enforced retroactively and delays in the judicial process    14    table of contents we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would negatively impact our reported revenues operating profits and income  in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities  in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our or other markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments any of which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants  a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants for the year ended december 31 2013 four tenants accounted for approximately 83 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and five tenants accounted for approximately 55 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these tenants is unwilling or unable to perform its obligations under our agreements with it our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  additionally due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage sometimes our tenants face financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  we may fail to realize the growth prospects and cost savings anticipated as a result of and will incur significant transaction and acquisitionrelated integration costs in connection with our acquisition of mipt  the success of the acquisition of mipt will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated business opportunities and growth prospects from combining our business with those of mipt we may never realize    15    table of contents  these business opportunities and growth prospects or we may encounter unanticipated accounting internal control regulatory or compliance problems  in addition we and mipt have operated independently as a result there may be a disruption of each companys ongoing businesses tax costs or inefficiencies or inconsistencies in standards controls information technology systems procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants employees or other third parties or our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition and could harm our financial performance we anticipate that we will incur certain nonrecurring charges in connection with integrating mipt including severance and charges associated with integrating process and systems we currently cannot identify the timing nature and amount of all such charges further the significant acquisitionrelated integration costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such charges are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to this integration will offset incremental transaction and acquisitionrelated costs over time this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all we also expect to incur costs to implement such efficiencies in that regard because mipt is a private company we may be required to improve mipts internal controls procedures and policies to meet standards applicable to public companies which may be timeconsuming and more expensive than anticipated  new technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues  the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budgets allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in the delivery of wireless communications radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space further a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which may substantially reduce funds otherwise available  effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes if we fail to remain qualified as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply  qualification as a reit requires application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the relevant provisions of the code  if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code            we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income    16    table of contents         we will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and            we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified  any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and operations would be reduced  furthermore as a result of our acquisition of mipt we own an interest in a subsidiary reit the subsidiary reit is independently subject to and must comply with the same reit requirements that we must satisfy in order to qualify as a reit together with all other rules applicable to reits if the subsidiary reit fails to qualify as a reit and certain relief provisions do not apply then i the subsidiary reit would become subject to federal income tax ii the subsidiary reit will be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years immediately following the year during which qualification was lost iii our ownership of shares in such subsidiary reit will cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the asset tests applicable to reits and any dividend income or gains derived by us from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated as income that qualifies for purposes of the 75 gross income test and iv we may fail certain of the asset tests applicable to reits in which event we will fail to qualify as a reit unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions  we may be limited in our ability to fund required distributions using cash generated through our trss  as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain our ability to receive distributions from our trss to fund these distributions is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and qualified rentalrelated services consequently no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income thus our ability to receive distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders  in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements  complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities  our use of trss enables us to engage in nonreit qualifying business activities under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy  specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be    17    table of contents  adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements prior to closing  in addition to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings  certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may create deferred and contingent tax liabilities  we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash  our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located  we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities sell assets or raise equity we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2014 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures required reit distribution payments and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations through 2014 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings an increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit rating a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements  if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results  our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under towers which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 88 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2013 are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases approximately 74 of the ground    18    table of contents  leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2023 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers will be eliminated  our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period or we may choose for business or other reasons not to exercise our right to purchase such towers in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we will lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  restrictive covenants in the agreements related to our securitization transactions our credit facilities and our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility  the agreements related to our securitization transactions include operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the agreements are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the agreements could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the secured assets and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such assets to us if the borrowers were to default on any of the loans the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured assets in which case we could lose such assets and the cash flow associated with such assets  the agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and could thus limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our debt agreements restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts  in addition reporting and information covenants in our credit agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more

incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap we are required to assess our goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income a significant adverse change in the business climate a decline in market capitalization or slower growth rates in our industry among others if the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made  it is possible that in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets these charges could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated  public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health or environmental effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant insurance with respect to these matters  we could have liability under environmental and occupational safety and health laws  our operations are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations

costs of remediating contamination at thirdparty sites to which we sent waste for disposal even if the original disposal may have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition    20    table of contents our towers or data centers may be affected

multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012    28    table of contents the following table details the

sites we operate are held pursuant to longterm capital leases including those subject to purchase options  the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2013 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2013 we expect to generate approximately 23 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 3035 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets  the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2013 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 15 of our rental and management operations revenues  rental and management operations revenue growth our rental and management revenue growth is comprised of i growth in organic revenue which is revenue from sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites and ii growth from sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites the primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our domestic and international rental and management segments are            recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from legacy sites            contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of cancellations            new revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites and            new revenue generated from new sites    29    table of contents we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases these sites utilization and profitability in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition consistent with our strategic acquisition of mipt we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria  rental and management operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth            domestic as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites  we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us            the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect our tenants to continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks            wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage            wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of onsite generators which typically results in additional equipment leased at the tower site and incremental revenue            wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration  we have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites    30    table of contents         international as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in three distinct stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as mtn telefónica and vodafone as part of our expansion efforts we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward  in emerging markets such as india ghana and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are also underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate  in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on third generation 3g network build outs with select investments in fourth generation 4g technology recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service  finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany and panama carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with a more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity  we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 39400 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growth  rental and management operations new site revenue growth the results of operations of mipt have been included in our consolidated results of operations since october 1 2013 the date of the acquisition during the period from october 1 2013 to december 31 2013 mipt generated total revenues of 841 million and gross margin of 650 million in addition to the approximately 5370 sites acquired through the acquisition of mipt during the year ended december 31 2013 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 7700 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues such as ground rent or fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio                     new sites acquired or constructed   2013     2012     2011     domestic     5260       960       470     international1     7810

of which may be passed through to our tenants these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities   nongaap financial measures  included in our analysis of our results of operations are

in connection with our acquisition of mipt on october 1 2013 we assumed approximately 149 billion principal amount of gtp notes and 326 million of debt in costa rica      4 assumed by us in connection with the unison acquisition and have anticipated repayment dates of april 15 2017 april 15 2020 and april 15 2020 respectively and a final maturity date of april 15 2040      5 denominated in cop the maturity dates for the colombian bridge loans may be extended from time to time      6 denominated in us dollars      7 includes approximately 274 million of capitalized accrued interest pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement      8 includes approximately 59 million of capitalized accrued interest pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement      9 denominated in zar and amortizes through march 31 2020      10 denominated in cop and amortizes through november 30 2020      11 includes approximately 05 million of capitalized accrued interest pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement      12 operating lease payments include payments to be made under noncancellable initial terms as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases      13 primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet primarily our straightline rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash      14 other noncurrent liabilities exclude 305 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and 309 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positions  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk  interest rate swap agreements we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia costa rica and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 1393 million interest rates ranging from 162 to 783 and expiration dates through november 2020 on february 12 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements  factors affecting sources of liquidity  internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2013 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to    56    table of contents  generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites  restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2012 credit facility the 2013 credit facility the shortterm credit facility and the 2013 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with each of these covenants  consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 650 to 100 through september 30 2014 and of 600 to 100 thereafter based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we could incur approximately 12 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 185 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio  consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt as defined in the loan agreements to adjusted ebitda of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 we could incur approximately 34 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 12 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 11 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio  interest coverage ratio in the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade we will be required to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2013 our interest expense which was 447 million for that period could increase by approximately 500 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 12 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants  any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants  restrictions under agreements relating to the securitization and the gtp notes the loan agreement related to the securitization and the gtp indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and    57    table of contents  other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers and gtp issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the loan agreement and gtp indentures  under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes as applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes are released to the borrowers or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by us since the inception of the loan in march 2013 through december 31 2013 the borrowers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately 4961 million since our assumption of the gtp notes on october 1 2013 through december 31 2013 the gtp issuers have distributed excess cash to us of approximately 488 million  in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers and the gtp issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio dscr calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amount of the payable trustee and servicing fees if the dscr with respect to the securities or any series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers or gtp partners is equal to or below 130x the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of securities or gtp notes under the loan agreement or gtp indentures as applicable will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the borrowers or the gtp issuers the funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the borrowers gtp towers or gtp partners for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of securities or gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters likewise the funds in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular sites for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar months  additionally an amortization period commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers and gtp partners and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites if the dscr of such series equals or falls below 115x the minimum dscr the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp towers and gtp partners for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters similarly the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar months  if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the securities has not been paid in full an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of securities is repaid in full  during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of securities or series of gtp notes on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further    58    table of contents  additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the securities or series of gtp notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or indentures as applicable  consequently a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers or gtp issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrowers were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured towers in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp notes declare such series of gtp notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such gtp notes furthermore if the gtp issuers were to default on a series of the gtp notes the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the gtp secured towers securing such series in which case we could lose the gtp secured towers and the revenue associated with those assets  as of december 31 2013 the borrowers dscr was 934x based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2013 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 383 million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 390 million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr as of december 31 2013 the dscr of gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites were 353x 284x and 248x respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2013 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of gtp notes gtp towers gtp partners and gtp cellular sites could endure a reduction of approximately 290 million 668 million and 157 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 310 million 733 million and 177 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr  as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program  in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factors we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement    59    table of contents  obligations accounting for acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2013 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result            impairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows under this approach is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized if the carrying value were to exceed the undiscounted cash flows measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment  we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the assets carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment            impairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess    60    table of contents during the year ended december 31 2013 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for one reporting unit whose fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 143 million for this reporting unit we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of i a 2 reduction in projected revenues ii a 60 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or iii a 20 reduction in terminal sales growth rate individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions  the goodwill recorded in this reporting unit approximated 154 million as of december 31 2013 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisition current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business            asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of 103 million during the year ended december 31 2013 the change in 2013 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary            acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price including any contingent consideration to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill for those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customerrelated and network location intangibles the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition the determination of the final purchase price and acquisitiondate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized            revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectibility is reasonably assured regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease agreements excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other    61    table of contents       inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancellable terms of the applicable leases total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 approximated 1477 million 1658 million and 1440 million respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met  we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 55 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured            rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease we calculate our straightline ground rent over the term of the ground lease including all renewal options to fulfill the tenant lease obligation in addition to the straightline ground rent expense recorded we also record an associated straightline rent liability in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation            stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and recognize an expense over the service period which generally represents the vesting period effective january 1 2013 our compensation committee adopted a death disability and retirement benefits program in connection with equity awards granted on or after january 1 2013 that provides for accelerated vesting and extended exercise periods of stock options and restricted stock units upon an employees death or permanent disability or upon an employees qualified retirement provided certain eligibility criteria are met accordingly for grants made on or after january 1 2013 we recognize compensation expense for all stockbased compensation over the shorter of i the fouryear vesting period or ii the period from the date of grant to the date the employee becomes eligible for such retirement benefits which may occur upon grant the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock units is    62    table of contents       based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets            income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code effective january 1 2012 and are generally not subject to federal and state income taxes on our qrss taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided that we meet certain organizational and operating requirements however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income  we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability  we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit  we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states  recently adopted accounting standards  in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued additional guidance on

step of the test as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying value  intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  deferred rent assetthe companys deferred rent asset is associated with noncancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the

financial instrumentsderivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are    f11    table of contents american tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements     recognized in the results of operations for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs  the primary risk managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk from time to time the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure on the variable rate debt under its credit facilities and to manage variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under these agreements the company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract the companys credit risk exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform the company may also enter into forward starting interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements which the company designates as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt settlement gains and losses on terminations of these forward starting interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and amortized to interest expense over the term of the newly issued debt  the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes  the company may also enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations these transactions do not typically qualify for hedge accounting and as a result the associated gains and losses are recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations  fair value measurementsthe company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value  discount and premium on notesthe company amortizes the discounts and premiums on its notes using the effective interest method over the term of the obligation such amortization is reflected in interest expense and interest income tv azteca net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  asset retirement obligationsthe company has certain obligations related to tower assets which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of the companys tower assets are located that require the recognition of an asset retirement obligation the fair value of asset retirement obligations associated with an entitys obligation to retire tangible longlived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated such asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows with an offsetting adjustment made to the related tangible longlived asset  the significant assumptions used in estimating the companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate the companys incremental borrowing rate  income taxesas

the company provides valuation allowances if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized within a reasonable period of time the company also periodically reviews its valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized  the company classifies uncertain tax positions as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year the company reports penalties and taxrelated interest expense

business combination the company first allocates the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customerrelated and network location intangibles the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired the company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset adjusted for an estimated reduction in fair value due to depreciation and the economic useful life when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired the company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash
