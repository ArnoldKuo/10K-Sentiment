  overview  we are a global independent owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 through our network development services business we offer towerrelated services domestically which primarily support our site leasing business  our communications real estate portfolio of 75594 communications sites as of december 31 2014 includes 28566 communications towers domestically 46598 communications towers internationally and 430 distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures  on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement with verizon communications inc verizon pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites for 5056 billion in cash at closing the proposed verizon transaction subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments  we operate as a reit and therefore are generally not subject to us federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing space on our towers however even as a reit we remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our taxable reit subsidiaries trss in addition our international assets and operations including those designated as direct or indirect qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities of a reit collectively qrss continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  the use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be treated as qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss during the year ended december 31 2014 we restructured certain of our german subsidiaries and certain of our domestic trss which included a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business to be treated as qrss as a result as of december 31 2014 our qrss include our domestic tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a portion of our network development services segment and indoor das networks business  our continuing operations are reported in three segments i domestic rental and management ii international rental and management and iii network development services for more information about our    1    table of contents  business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 98 and 97 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable tenyear term with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage approximately 30 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn has been approximately 1 to 2 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our cash revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period cash rental and management segment revenue            high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through and shared across our tenant base            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites  our rental and management operations include the operation of communications towers managed networks the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65 65 and 67 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively    2    table of contents our international rental and management segment which consists of communications sites in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda provides a source of growth and diversification including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development in november 2014 we expanded our global footprint by signing an agreement to acquire over 4800 communications sites in nigeria our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33 33 and 30 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  communications towers approximately 95 96 and 96 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio mobile video and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 84 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2014            international telef√≥nica in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany mexico and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda nextel international in brazil chile and mexico grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico acquired by atampt in january 2015 and vodafone in germany ghana india and south africa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 57 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states brazil chile colombia ghana india and mexico we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states typically we design build and operate our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate infrastructure such as small cell deployment that may support our tenants networks in these areas            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements    3    table of contents         shared generators we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generators  network development services  through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services network development services primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades this segment accounted for approximately 2 2 and 3 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in the united states and in our international markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the buildout of fourth generation 4g networks while our international markets are in various stages of network development as of december 31 2014 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites    4    table of contents         invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs new site construction and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by pursuing such investments in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve upon our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis            maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to our disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade ratings we remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth we continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and as of december 31 2014 had approximately 27 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio  capital allocation strategy  the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt as necessary to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range            capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our riskadjusted return on investment criteria our riskadjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry risk            return excess capital to stockholders if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii our capital expenditures iii repayment of debt as necessary to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and iv anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders  during 2014 we generated 21 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund 19 billion of investments including 10 billion of acquisitions and 9744 million of capital expenditures in addition in 2014 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4046 million to our common stockholders and approximately 160 million to our preferred stockholders  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be    5    table of contents  achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime            wireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market such as the pricing environment past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur is being or will be deployed            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  recent transactions  acquisitions  from january 1 2014 through december 31 2014 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 8450 sites including approximately 3133 buildtosuits and we believe the assets constructed and acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins significant acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2014 included the acquisition of i 100 of the equity interests of br towers sa a brazilian telecommunications real estate company br towers which at closing owned or held exclusive use rights for 4617 towers and 47 property interests in brazil and ii entities holding a portfolio of 59 communications sites which at the time of acquisition were leased primarily to radio and television broadcast tenants and four property interests in the united states from richland properties llc and other related entities richland  in addition during the fourth quarter of 2014 we signed definitive agreements to acquire approximately 11280 additional communications sites in brazil and nigeria and in february 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states  we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  financing transactions  during the year ended december 31 2014 to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio we strengthened our balance sheet by completing a number of    6    table of contents  key financing initiatives including those set forth below for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  senior notes offerings in january 2014 we completed a registered public offering through a reopening of our i 340 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the 340 notes in an aggregate principal amount of 2500 million and our ii 500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the 500 notes in an aggregate principal amount of 5000 million in august 2014 we completed a registered public offering of our 3450 senior unsecured notes due 2021 the 3450 notes in an aggregate principal amount of 6500 million we used the net proceeds from each offering primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities  mandatory convertible preferred stock offering in may 2014 we completed a registered public offering of 6000000 shares of our 525 mandatory convertible preferred stock series a par value 001 per share the mandatory convertible preferred stock we used the net proceeds from the offering to fund acquisitions initially funded by indebtedness incurred under our 20 billion multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 2013 credit facility  credit facilities in september 2014 we entered into an amendment and restatement of our 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the 2012 credit facility as amended and restated the 2014 credit facility which among other things increased the commitments thereunder to 15 billion and extended the maturity date to january 31 2020 as a result as of december 31 2014 we had the ability to borrow up to 24 billion under our existing credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit   regulatory matters  towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 66 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2014 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act    7    table of contents  has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition certain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownership  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations  portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure    8    table of contents competition  we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure limited wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project   customer demand  our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged over 30 billion over the past three years resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            increasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks            subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile internet and video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments and            the increasing availability of lower cost smartphones internationally    9    table of contents we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites  in addition our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  employees  as of december 31 2014 we employed 2974 fulltime individuals
