overview  we are a global independent owner operator and developer of communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2014 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades we operate as a reit for us federal income tax purposes    28    table of contents the following table details the number of communications sites excluding

including those subject to purchase options    2 in september 2014 we completed the sale of the operations in panama  on february 5 2015 we signed a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction pursuant to which we expect to acquire the exclusive right to lease acquire or otherwise operate and manage up to 11489 wireless communications sites in the united states for 5056 billion in cash at closing subject to certain conditions and limited adjustments  the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial noncancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2014 we expect to generate approximately 27 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation approximately 30 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both in addition certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs  the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be canceled upon the payment of a termination fee  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2014 loss of revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented approximately 15 of our rental and management operations revenues  rental and management operations revenue growth due to our diversified communications site portfolio our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant remaining tower capacity and    29    table of contents  tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors including tower height tower type environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instances tower capacity can be increased through tower augmentation  the primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our domestic and international rental and management segments are            recurring organic revenue which is revenue from tenant leases attributable to sites that existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites            contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of cancellations            new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our legacy sites and            new revenue attributable to sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites  we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites we are able to increase these sites utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks while also deploying next generation wireless technologies in addition consistent with our signing of a definitive agreement for the proposed verizon transaction we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and in new markets where we can achieve our riskadjusted return on investment objectives in a majority of our international markets revenue also includes the reimbursement of direct costs such as ground rent or power and fuel costs  rental and management operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation and lease amendments our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services the penetration of advanced wireless devices the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth            domestic as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications and advanced wireless devices wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites growth in wireless data demand has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy increasing levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites  based on industry research and projections we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us            the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as a result we expect our tenants to continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks            wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their    30    table of contents       existing sites while also adding new cell sites we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage            wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of onsite generators which typically results in additional equipment or space leased at the tower site and incremental revenue            wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration  we have entered into holistic master lease agreements with three of our four largest tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on certain of our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites            international as part of our international expansion initiatives we have targeted markets in various stages of network development in order to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as mtn group limited telefónica sa vodafone group plc and bharti airtel limited we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward  in emerging markets such as ghana india and uganda wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas in more developed urban locations within these markets earlystage data network deployments are underway carriers are focused on completing voice network buildouts while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate  in markets with rapidly evolving network technology such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business initial voice networks for the most part have already been built out and carriers are focused on third generation 3g network build outs and augmentations with select initial investments in fourth generation 4g technology recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly which mandates that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service  finally in markets with more mature network technology such as germany carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage with a more mature customer base higher smartphone penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity  we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets as a result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 46700 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable longterm growth    31    table of contents rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2014 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8450 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues such as ground rent or power and fuel costs and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our riskadjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio

management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes repairs and maintenance these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities  network development services segment revenue growth as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues  nongaap financial measures  included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest

represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap and therefore these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions rather adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 each is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 adjusted ebitda is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our periodtoperiod operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature and 5 each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies  our measurement of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo and affo may not however be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies reconciliations of adjusted ebitda nareit ffo

the outstanding 4625 notes in accordance with the terms thereof    11 includes payments under noncancellable initial terms as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option which we expect to renew because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases    12 primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet primarily our straightline rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash    13 excludes 266 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and 249 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positions  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk  interest rate swap agreements we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to variability in interest rates on debt in colombia and south africa all of our interest rate swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have an aggregate notional amount of 799 million interest rates ranging from 574 to 783 and expiration dates through april 2021 in february 2014 we repaid the costa rica loan and subsequently terminated the associated interest rate swap agreements additionally in connection with entering into the colombian credit facility in october 2014 we terminated our preexisting interest rate    56    table of contents  swap agreement and entered into a new interest rate swap agreement with an aggregate notional value of 1000 billion cop approximately 418 million  factors affecting sources of liquidity  our liquidity is dependent on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants our compliance with which would be material to an investors understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity  internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2014 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites  restrictions under loan agreements relating to our credit facilities the loan agreements for the 2014 credit facility the 2013 credit facility and the 2013 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to i total leverage ii senior secured leverage and iii interest coverage as set forth below as of december 31 2014 we were in compliance with each of these covenants  consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 600 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 17 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 291 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio on february 20 2015 we entered into amendments to the 2013 term loan 2013 credit facility and 2014 credit facility pursuant to which this ratio will be increased upon the closing of the proposed verizon transaction  consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 we could incur approximately 45 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with the current ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 17 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 15 billion and we would still remain in compliance with the current ratio  interest coverage ratio in the event our debt ratings fall below investment grade we will be required to maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense each as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 our interest expense which was 549 million for that period could increase by approximately 532 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 13 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio    57    table of contents the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants  any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants  restrictions under agreements relating to the securitization and the gtp notes the first amended and restated loan and security agreement related to the securitization the loan agreement and indentures governing the gtp notes the gtp indentures include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations among other things american tower asset sub llc and american tower asset sub ii llc the borrowers and the gtp issuers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets subject to customary carveouts for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture  under the terms of the agreements amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the nonrecourse loan relating to the securitization the loan or the gtp notes as applicable which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement on a monthly basis after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement the excess cash flows generated from the operation of the assets securing the loan or the gtp notes are released to the borrowers or the applicable gtp issuer which can then be distributed to and used by us during the year ended december 31 2014 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of 7157 million and the gtp issuers have distributed excess cash to us of 1641 million  in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers and the gtp issuers must maintain a specified debt service coverage ratio dscr calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow as defined in the loan agreement or the applicable gtp indenture to the amount of interest required to be paid over the succeeding twelve months on the principal amount of the loan or the principal amount of the gtp notes that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination plus the amounts payable for trustee and servicing fees if the dscr with respect to the secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 20132a issued in our securitization the securities or any series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners is equal to or below 130x the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar quarter and it continues for two consecutive calendar quarters or if the dscr with respect to any series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites is equal to or below the cash trap dscr at the end of any calendar month and it continues for two consecutive calendar months then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required with respect to the particular series of securities or gtp notes under the loan agreement or gtp indentures as applicable will be deposited into reserve accounts instead of being released to the borrowers or the gtp issuers the funds in the reserve accounts will not be released to the borrowers or gtp partners for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of securities or gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters likewise the funds in the reserve account will not be released to gtp cellular sites for distribution to us unless the dscr with respect to such series of gtp notes exceeds the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar months    58    table of contents additionally an amortization period commences as of the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners and as of the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites if the dscr of such series equals or falls below 115x the minimum dscr the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar quarter with respect to the securities and the series of gtp notes issued by gtp partners for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters similarly the amortization period will continue to exist until the end of any calendar month with respect to the series of gtp notes issued by gtp cellular sites for which the dscr exceeds the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar months  if on the anticipated repayment date the outstanding principal amount with respect to any series of the gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of the securities has not been paid in full an amortization period will continue until such principal amount of the applicable series of gtp notes or the component of the loan corresponding to the applicable subclass of securities is repaid in full  during an amortization period all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the applicable subclass of securities or series of gtp notes on each monthly payment date and so would not be available for distribution to us further additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any subclass of the securities or series of gtp notes from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the loan agreement or the gtp indentures as applicable  consequently a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers or gtp issuers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions meet reit distribution requirements make mandatory convertible preferred stock dividend payments and fund our stock repurchase program if the borrowers were to default on the loan the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the 5195 wireless and broadcast communications towers that secure the loan the secured towers in which case we could lose the secured towers and the revenue associated with those towers in addition upon occurrence and during an event of default the trustee may in its discretion or at direction of holders of more than 50 of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of gtp notes declare such series of gtp notes immediately due and payable in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such gtp notes furthermore if the gtp issuers were to default on a series of the gtp notes the trustee may demand collect take possession of receive settle compromise adjust sue for foreclose or realize upon all or any portion of the 2845 towers and 1035 property interests and other related assets that secure the gtp notes the gtp secured sites securing such series of the gtp notes in which case we could lose the gtp secured sites and the revenue associated with those assets  as of december 31 2014 the borrowers dscr was 1022x based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 4286 million in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 4358 million in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr as of december 31 2014 the dscr of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites were 288x and 254x respectively based on the net cash flow of gtp partners and gtp cellular sites for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2014 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding twelve months on the applicable series of gtp notes gtp partners and gtp cellular sites could endure a reduction of approximately 687 million and 164 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the cash trap dscr and approximately 752 million and 184 million respectively in net cash flow before triggering the minimum dscr  as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital    59    table of contents  through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements pay mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness  in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factors we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2014 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for a summary of our significant accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result            impairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable  we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements  we review our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indicators of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows  if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our longlived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment            impairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable    60    table of contents goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment and we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess  during the year ended december 31 2014 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount by a substantial margin            asset retirement obligations when required we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located generally the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligations estimated settlement date  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 132 million during the year ended december 31 2014 the change in 2014 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion in the consolidated statements of operations the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary            acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations are included with those of the company from the dates of the respective acquisitions any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition            revenue recognition our revenue from leasing arrangements including fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease arrangements is reported on a straightline basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clauses tied to the consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our    61    table of contents       tenants are excluded from the straightline calculation total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximated 1237 million 1477 million and 1658 million respectively amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met  we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 56 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured            rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured            stockbased compensation the stockbased compensation expense recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets            income taxes accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income  we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be    62    table of contents  realized management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability  we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit  we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states  accounting standards update  for a discussion of recent accounting
