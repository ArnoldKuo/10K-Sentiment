individually and collectively with its subsidiaries as the context requires    iii    table of contents part i      item 1 business  overview  we are a leading independent owner operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites effective january 1 2012 we reorganized to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes the reit conversion  our communications real estate portfolio of 54604 sites as of december 31 2012 includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2012 22534 towers domestically and 31789 towers internationally in addition our portfolio also includes 281 das networks that we operate primarily in malls and casinos and select outdoor environments we also manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as well as hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development  we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda  our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries trss a trs is a subsidiary of a reit that is subject to applicable corporate income tax our use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include our network development services segment in addition we have included our international operations and managed networks business within our trss we are currently considering changing the election of one or more of our previously designated trss which hold certain of our international operations to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss    1    table of contents as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing towers however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  annually as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain our reit taxable income typically will not include income earned by our trss except to the extent the trss pay dividends in 2012 we paid regular cash distributions of an aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize net operating losses nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 97 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site infrastructure where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance in most of our international markets a portion of our operating costs is passed through to our tenants such as ground rent or fuel costs our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites due to their attractive locations additionally we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter and lease payments that typically increase based on a fixed escalation approximately 35 per year in the united states or inflationary index as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historical churn has been approximately 12 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in very limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our historical churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our rental and management segment revenue    2    table of contents         high operating leverage incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as additional tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through to our tenants            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 67 72 and 79 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda provides a source of diversification and growth our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 30 26 and 19 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the installation of shared generators domestically  communications towers we own and operate communications towers in the united states brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda approximately 96 98 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 74 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2012            international telefónica in brazil chile colombia mexico and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico nextel international in brazil chile and mexico and vodafone in india germany ghana south africa and uganda accounted for an aggregate of approximately 55 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2012  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks rooftop management property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide    3    table of contents  communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate 281 das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states mexico brazil ghana and india we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants and currently operate such networks in the united states typically we design build and operate our das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we are also currently evaluating other complementary network strategies such as small cell deployments            rooftop management we provide management services to property owners in the united states who own rooftops capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers and other tenants as urban markets continue to evolve we continue to evaluate infrastructure that may support additional services to meet the growing needs of our tenants networks            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements            shared generators we install shared backup power generators at a number of our sites in the united states which we lease to our tenants to help reinforce their networks network development services  through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 3 2 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices as well as the expanding  infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to    4    table of contents  achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio further improve upon our operational performance and maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants as of december 31 2012 we had a global average of approximately 20 tenants per tower we believe that of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity the vast majority can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites            invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns by pursuing such investments this includes pursuing opportunities to invest through new site construction and acquisitions in our domestic market and in select international markets which we believe have a competitive wireless industry where wireless carriers are deploying next generation technologies and are attractive from a macroeconomic standpoint in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve on our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis            maintain a strong balance sheet we will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet this includes maintaining our net financial leverage ratio within a target range and ensuring ample liquidity is available to pursue our strategy as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 11 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings and our current level of net leverage provide us with consistent access to the capital markets and the ability to actively invest in our portfolio and pursue acquisition opportunities  capital allocation strategy  as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain which is our first priority within our capital allocation strategy after our reit distributions we expect to continue to deploy our discretionary capital through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and through acquisitions the objective of our allocation of our discretionary capital is to simultaneously increase recurring free cash flow and our return on invested capital in addition we intend to return our remaining excess discretionary capital if any to stockholders through continuing our stock repurchase program or declaring special distributions from time to time during 2012 we generated 14144 million of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 29843 million of investments including 5680 million of capital expenditures 19980 million of acquisitions and 627 million of stock repurchases including commissions and fees during 2012 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders            discretionary capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program    5    table of contents       this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we will seek to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criteria our risk adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as country risk counterparty risk and product line risk            return excess discretionary capital to stockholders if we have sufficient capital available to i satisfy our reit distribution requirements ii fund our discretionary capital expenditures and acquisition opportunities and iii fund anticipated future investment while remaining within our target leverage range we will seek to return any excess discretionary capital to stockholders we currently utilize a stock repurchase program to facilitate this return  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by establishing an independent wireless infrastructure leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved in addition we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new geographic area we review the countrys political stability historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals and the general business and legal environment including property rights and regulatory environment            wireless industry analysis to ensure sufficient demand for an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless industry and the stage of its wireless network deployment characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include a country that has multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as participating in spectrum auctions that have or are anticipated to occur            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with a competitive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating the type of transaction its ability to meet our risk adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved as well as how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  growth and expansion  in 2012 we continued to focus on growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions including expansion into new international markets and new site development consistent with our international growth strategy during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our communications real estate portfolio through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8790 towers the installation of approximately 20 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites in the united states in addition we continue to evaluate complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business united states we continued to build on our established foundation in the united states growing our domestic communications sites portfolio by 6 during the year ended december 31 2012 primarily through the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the country our expansion in    6    table of contents  the united states during 2012 included the acquisition and construction of approximately 945 towers the installation of approximately 15 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites international during 2012 we took additional steps to position ourselves for expansion into new international markets after announcing the launch of operations in uganda at the end of 2011 we acquired approximately 960 towers through our joint venture during the first half of 2012 in addition in november 2012 we announced that we had launched operations in germany and subsequently completed the purchase of approximately 2030 towers in the fourth quarter of 2012 thereby expanding our international footprint to ten countries as of december 31 2012 our international expansion efforts during 2012 also included the acquisition and construction in the aggregate of approximately 4855 towers and the installation of five inbuilding das networks in our existing markets  regulatory matters  towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 69 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and painted lighted and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose certain permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations these regulations vary but typically require tower owners andor our tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower    7    table of contents  construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted new regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations in june 2012 the chilean government passed a new law that imposes certain zoning restrictions retroactively on telecommunications towers located throughout chile and may require us to modify or remove certain of our existing towers  portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec status or other similar status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants both domestic and international may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or waste certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding a new antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure  competition  our rental and management segments compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies    8    table of contents  independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants internal staffs we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project  customer demand  our strategy is predicated on our belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has historically been approximately 25 to 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            wireless service provider focus on network quality and resulting investments in coverage and capacity of their network            subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as email and internet and the corresponding deployments of advanced wireless networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as these factors continue to grow as a competitive necessity in the united states on a widespread basis wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in the international markets we serve are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video and            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial data network deployments  we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain    9    table of contents  their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies andor the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investment away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or permit equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites   employees  as of december 31 2012 we employed 2432 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory  available

contents   item 1a risk factors  decrease in demand for our communications sites would materially and adversely affect our operating results and we cannot control that demand  factors affecting the demand for our communications sites and to a lesser extent our network development services could materially and adversely affect our operating results those factors include            technological changes            delays or changes in the deployment of next generation wireless technologies            governmental licensing of spectrum or restricting or revoking spectrum licenses            mergers or consolidations among wireless service providers            increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers            a decrease in consumer demand for wireless services due to general economic conditions or other factors            the financial condition of wireless service providers            the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures on network infrastructure and            zoning environmental health or other government regulations or changes in the application and enforcement thereof  any downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit markets could impact consumer demand for wireless services if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider tenants could experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their capital expenditure plans which could materially and adversely affect leasing demand for our communications sites and our network development services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  furthermore the demand for broadcast space in the united states and mexico depends on the needs of television and radio broadcasters among other things technological advances including the development of satellitedelivered radio and video services may reduce the need for towerbased broadcast transmission in addition any significant increase in attrition rate or decrease in overall demand for broadcast space could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  new technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues  the development and implementation of new technologies designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless networks or changes in a tenants business model could reduce the need for towerbased wireless services decrease demand for tower space or reduce obtainable lease rates in addition tenants may have less of their budget allocated to lease space on our towers as the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies examples of these technologies include spectrally efficient technologies which could relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity needs and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technologies could shift a portion of our tenants network investment away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites moreover the emergence of alternative technologies could reduce the need for towerbased broadcast services transmission and reception for example the growth in delivery of wireless communications radio and video services by direct broadcast satellites could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space further    11    table of contents  a tenant may decide to no longer outsource tower infrastructure or otherwise change its business model which would result in a decrease in our revenue the development and implementation of any of these and similar technologies to any significant degree or changes in a tenants business model could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do  our business and that of our tenants are subject to federal state local and foreign regulations in certain jurisdictions these regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively local zoning authorities and community organizations are often opposed to construction of communications sites in their communities and these regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modifications additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demands and requirements in addition in certain foreign jurisdictions we are required to pay annual license fees and these fees may be subject to substantial increases by the government foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and currently are not required to pay license fees may enact license fees which may apply retroactively in certain foreign jurisdictions there may be changes to zoning regulations or construction laws based on site location which may result in increased costs to modify certain of our existing towers or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain towers to ensure compliance with such changes existing regulatory policies may materially and adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us or that prevent such projects in certain locations furthermore the tax laws regulations and interpretations governing reits may change at any time these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  if our tenants consolidate merge or share site infrastructure with each other to a significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected  significant consolidation among our tenants may result in the decommissioning of certain existing communications sites because certain portions of these tenants networks may be redundant for example in the united states recently combined companies have either rationalized or announced plans to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which may result in the decommissioning of certain equipment on our communications sites we would expect a similar outcome in certain other countries where we do business if consolidation of certain tenants occurs in addition certain combined companies have undergone or are currently undergoing a modernization of their networks and these and other tenants could determine not to renew leases with us as a result our ongoing contractual revenues and our future results may be negatively impacted if a significant number of these leases are not renewed similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our communications sites  we could suffer adverse tax or other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions  we periodically are subject to examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business and we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future moreover the internal revenue service and any state or local tax authority may successfully assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a reit or with respect to our trss in which case either we will owe these taxes plus applicable interest and penalties if any or we will offset additional income as determined by a tax authority with our nols if we offset such additional income with our nols our required distributions to maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit will increase and we may be required to pay deficiency dividends and an associated interest charge if our prior reit distributions were insufficient in light of the reduced available nols    12    table of contents in addition domestic and international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge if there are tax benefits that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or use our nols or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities all of which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants  a substantial portion of our total operating revenues is derived from a small number of tenants for the year ended december 31 2012 four tenants accounted for approximately 74 of our domestic rental and management segment revenue and five tenants accounted for approximately 55 of our international rental and management segment revenue if any of these tenants are unwilling or unable to perform their obligations under our agreements with them our revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience disputes with our tenants generally regarding the interpretation of terms in our leases we have historically resolved these disputes in a manner that did not have a material adverse effect on us or our tenant relationships however it is possible that such disputes could lead to a termination of our leases with tenants or a material modification of the terms of those leases either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these disputes through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenues or increased costs resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  additionally due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenants many wireless service providers operate with substantial leverage some of our tenants may experience financial difficulty or may file for bankruptcy in addition many of our tenants and potential tenants rely on capital raising activities to fund their operations and capital expenditures downturns in the economy and disruptions in the financial and credit markets have periodically made it more difficult and more expensive to raise capital if our tenants or potential tenants are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plans they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communications sites and our network development services business if as a result of a prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our significant tenants experienced financial difficulties or filed for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible accounts receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset or customerrelated intangible asset the loss of significant tenants or the loss of all or a portion of our anticipated lease revenues from certain tenants could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  our international business operations and our expansion into new markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 30 of our consolidated revenue was generated by our international operations compared to 26 for the year ended december 31 2011 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including            changes in a specific countrys or regions political or economic conditions including inflation            laws or regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital    13    table of contents         changes to existing or new tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communications sites or our international acquisitions which may be applied or enforced retroactively            changes to zoning regulations or construction laws which could retroactively be applied to our existing communications sites            expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring divestiture            actions restricting or revoking spectrum licenses or suspending business under prior licenses            material site security issues            significant license surcharges            increases in the cost of labor as a result of unionization or otherwise            potential failure to comply with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act or similar local antibribery laws or office of foreign assets control requirements and            uncertain rulings or results from legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof which may be enforced retroactively and delays in the judicial process  in our international operations many of our tenants are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities  in addition as we continue to invest in joint venture opportunities internationally our partners may have business or economic goals that are inconsistent with ours be in positions to take action contrary to our interests policies or objectives have competing interests in our markets that could create conflict of interest issues withhold consents contrary to our requests or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitments which could expose us to additional liabilities or costs including requiring us to assume and fulfill the obligations of that joint venture  we also face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts our revenues earned from our international operations are primarily denominated in their respective local currencies we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activities relating to our nonus dollar operations and a weakening of these foreign currencies against the us dollar would have a negative impact on our reported revenues operating profits and income  our expansion initiatives involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our operating results disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk if we are not able to successfully integrate operations assets and personnel  as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisitions achieving the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on integrating operations communications tower portfolios and personnel in a timely and efficient manner integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reasons including among other things differing systems and processes potential cultural differences customary business practices and conflicting policies procedures and operations in addition the integration of businesses may significantly burden management and internal resources including the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel  furthermore our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel and the other risks    14    table of contents  described above in our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as a result our foreign operations and expansion initiatives may not succeed and may materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results  our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms approximately 88 of the communications sites in our portfolio as of december 31 2012 are located on land we lease pursuant to operating leases approximately 78 of the ground leases for these sites have a final expiration date of 2022 and beyond further for various reasons title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the united states our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us  our industry is highly competitive and our tenants have numerous alternatives in leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers are larger and may have greater financial resources than we do while other competitors may have lower return on investment criteria than we do  competitive pricing for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates and services income as well as require us to pay significantly more to acquire assets in addition we may not be able to renew existing tenant leases or enter into new tenant leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable or choose not to exercise our rights to purchase towers that are subject to lease and sublease agreements at the end of the applicable period our cash flows derived from such towers would be eliminated  our communications real estate portfolio includes towers that we operate pursuant to lease and sublease agreements that include a purchase option at the end of each lease period we may not have the required available capital to exercise our right to purchase leased or subleased towers at the end of the applicable period even if we do have available capital we may choose not to exercise our right to purchase such towers for business or other reasons in the event that we do not exercise these purchase rights or are otherwise unable to acquire an interest that would allow us to continue to operate these towers after the applicable period we would lose the cash flows derived from such towers in the event that we decide to exercise these purchase rights the benefits of the acquisitions of a significant number of towers may not exceed the associated acquisition compliance and integration costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition    15    table of contents if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available  we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective for the taxable year beginning january 1 2012 if we fail to qualify as a reit we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply we believe that we are organized and will qualify as a reit upon timely filing our federal income tax return for 2012 and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a reit however we cannot guarantee that we will qualify or remain so qualified including if our board of directors determines it is no longer in our interests to be a reit  qualification as a reit requires application of certain highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the code which provisions may change from time to time to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control there are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of the code provisions  for instance the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25 of the fair market value of our assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit  if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit and are not entitled to relief under the code            we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income            we will be subject to federal and state income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and            we would be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable years following the year during which we were so disqualified  any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and operations would be reduced  we may be limited in our ability to fund required distributions using cash generated through our trss  as a reit we must distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain timing differences between the receipt of income and the recognition of income for federal income tax purposes as well as the effect of nondeductible expenditures may impair our ability to fund required distributions if our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our reit taxable income and as a result may fail to qualify for taxation as a reit to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the code  our ability to receive distributions from our trss is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a reit in particular at least 75 of our gross income for each taxable year as a reit must be derived from real estate which principally includes gross income from the leasing of our communications sites and rentalrelated services consequently no more than 25 of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other nonqualifying types of income thus our ability to receive    16    table of contents  distributions from our trss may be limited and may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders specifically if our trss become highly profitable we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our trss in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability  in addition the majority of our income and cash flows from our trss are generated from our international operations in many cases there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the united states to help satisfy reit distribution requirements  complying with reit requirements may limit our flexibility or cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities  to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the nature and diversification of our assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the concentration of ownership of our stock compliance with these tests will require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments including the purchase of nonqualifying assets the expansion of nonreal estate activities and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy we could also be required to liquidate otherwise attractive investments and could be limited in our ability to hedge liabilities and risks furthermore acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some reit requirements prior to closing in addition we may receive pressure from investors not to pursue growth opportunities that are not immediately accretive  under the code no more than 25 of the value of the assets of a reit may be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investments in our managed networks business or network development services segment as currently structured and operated in other nonreit qualifying operations or assets or in international operations conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure to meet our annual distribution requirements we may be required to distribute amounts that may otherwise be used for our operations including amounts that may otherwise be invested in future acquisitions capital expenditures or repayment of debt and it is possible that we might be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to fund these distributions even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings  certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities  we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash  our trs assets and operations will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located  we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring within a specified period generally ten years after the reit conversion up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2012 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis as of january 1 2012 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not    17    table of contents  expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability but our plans may change in the future  we may need additional financing to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities sell assets or raise equity we believe our cash provided by operations for the year ending december 31 2013 will sufficiently fund our cash needs for operations capital expenditures required reit distribution payments and cash debt service interest and principal repayments obligations through 2013 however we anticipate that we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our reit distribution requirements depending on market conditions we may seek to raise capital through credit facilities or debt or equity offerings additionally a downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets or preclude us from obtaining funds on investment grade terms and conditions further certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund our capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives or satisfy our reit distribution requirements  our leverage and debt service obligations may materially and adversely affect us  in order to meet the reit distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a reit we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings any insufficiency of our cash flows to cover our reit distribution requirements could adversely impact our ability to raise short and longterm debt to sell assets or to offer equity securities furthermore the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives this would increase our total leverage  as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 88 billion of consolidated debt and the ability to borrow additional amounts of approximately 07 billion under our credit facilities our leverage could render us unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness we are also permitted subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness to draw down on our credit facilities and obtain additional longterm debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  our leverage could have significant negative consequences on our business results of operations or financial condition including            impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of towers subject to our securitization transaction if an uncured default occurs            increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing            increasing our borrowing costs if our current investment grade debt ratings decline            requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures or reit distributions            requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms to meet payment obligations    18    table of contents         limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the markets in which we compete            limiting our ability to repurchase our common stock or make distributions to our stockholders and            placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources  restrictive covenants in the loan agreements related to our securitization transaction the loan agreements for our credit facilities and the indentures governing our debt securities could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility  the loan agreement related to our securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets a failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers subject to the securitization transaction and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such towers to us if the borrowers were to default on the loan the servicer on the loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction in which case we could lose such towers and the excess cash flow associated with such towers  the loan agreements for our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants as well as requirements to comply with certain leverage and other financial maintenance tests and could thus limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distributions to stockholders and engaging in various types of transactions including mergers acquisitions and sales of assets additionally our indentures restrict our and our subsidiaries ability to incur liens securing our or their indebtedness these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities further if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we would be subject to federal corporate income tax and potentially a nondeductible excise tax on the retained amounts  in addition reporting and information covenants in our loan agreements and indentures require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to timely provide the required information we would be in breach of these covenants for more information regarding the covenants and requirements discussed above please see item 7 of this annual report under

financial statements included in this annual report  we may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges which could result in a significant reduction to our earnings  we review goodwill and intangible assets annually to determine if it is impaired or more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income a significant adverse change in the business climate a decline in market capitalization or slower growth rates in our industry among others if the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred we are required to record a noncash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made    19    table of contents while we did not record any impairment charges during the year ended december 31 2012 it is possible that in the future we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill or for other intangible assets these charges could be significant which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  we have limited experience operating as a reit which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy debt service obligations  we have only been operating as a reit since january 1 2012 accordingly the experience of our senior management operating a reit is limited and may adversely affect our ability to qualify or remain qualified as a reit failure to maintain reit status could adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow

have complied with all legal requirements at the time many of these laws and regulations contain information reporting and record keeping requirements we cannot assure you that we are at all times in complete compliance with all environmental requirements we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future in certain jurisdictions these laws and regulations could be applied or enforced retroactively it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our towers or data centers may be affected by natural disasters and other unforeseen events for which our insurance may not provide adequate coverage  our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as ice and wind storms tornadoes floods hurricanes and earthquakes as well as other unforeseen events any damage or destruction to our towers or data centers or certain unforeseen events may impact our ability to provide services to our tenants while we maintain insurance coverage for natural disasters we may not have adequate insurance to cover the associated costs of repair or reconstruction for a major future event further we carry business interruption insurance but our insurance may not adequately cover all of our lost revenues including potential revenues from new tenants that could have been added to our towers but for the event if we are unable to provide services to our tenants it could lead to tenant loss resulting in a corresponding material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition  our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if these perceived risks are substantiated  public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technology could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communications services and increase opposition to the development and expansion of    20    table of contents  tower sites the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health or environmental effects has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years and numerous healthrelated lawsuits have been filed against wireless carriers and wireless device manufacturers if a scientific study or court decision resulted in a finding that radio frequency emissions pose health risks to consumers it could negatively impact our tenants and the market for wireless services which could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we do not maintain any significant

any enforcement action against us  one of our subsidiaries spectrasite communications inc sci a predecessor in interest by conversion to spectrasite communications llc was involved in a lawsuit brought in mexico against a former mexican subsidiary of sci the subsidiary of sci was sold in 2002 prior to our acquisition of sci in 2005 the lawsuit concerns a terminated tower construction contract and related agreements with a wireless carrier in mexico the primary issue for us is whether sci itself can be found liable to the mexican carrier the trial and lower appellate courts initially found that sci had no such liability in part because mexican courts did not have the necessary jurisdiction over sci in september 2010 following several decisions by mexican appellate courts including the supreme court of mexico and related appeals by both parties an intermediate appellate court issued a new decision that would have if enforceable reimposed liability on sci if the primary defendant in the case were unable to satisfy the judgment in its decision the intermediate appellate court identified potential damages in the form of potential statutory interest of approximately 67 million as of that date on october 14 2010 we filed a new constitutional appeal to again dispute the decision which was rejected on january 24 2012 the case was returned to the trial court to determine whether any actual damages should be awarded to the mexican carrier on august 2 2012 the trial court entered judgment against the primary defendant and sci in the amount of approximately 65 million each party appealed the trial courts determination and on october 17 2012 the appellate court entered judgment against the primary defendant in the amount of approximately 79 million with sci responsible for any amount not recoverable from the primary defendant on november 9 2012 sci filed a constitutional appeal of the appellate court ruling in connection with our acquisition of a portfolio of communications sites from the mexican carrier on january 31 2013 the mexican carrier released all of its claims against sci including any obligation of sci to pay any damages  we

discontinued operations  executive overview  our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012    29    table of contents the following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of december 31 2012                 country   number ofowned sites     number ofoperated sites1     united states     16378       6421     international             brazil     4193       155     chile     1181

uganda     1043              1 all of the sites we operate are held pursuant to longterm capital leases including those subject to purchase options  the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2012 we expect to generate approximately 20 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods excluding the impact of straightline lease accounting in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed percentage on average approximately 35 in the united states inflation or inflation with a fixed minimum or maximum escalation for the year revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the noncancellable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants which increases the noncancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues  the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 13 of our rental and management operations revenues  rental and management operations revenue growth the primary factors affecting the revenue growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are            recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites            contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of cancellations            new revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites and            new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites    30    table of contents we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their networks as well as roll out next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria  rental and management operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth            domestic as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites this level of wireless communications services growth has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy consistent levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites  we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us            the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as a result our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks            wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites as well as add new cell sites            wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of onsite generators which results in additional equipment leased at the tower site            wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration  we signed holistic master lease agreements with three of our four major tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue growth and a reduction in the potential impact of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and foster strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly deploy technology on our sites            international most of our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services as a result demand for our communications sites is predominantly driven by continued voice network investments new market entrants and initial third generation 3g data network deployments for example in india nationwide voice networks    31    table of contents       continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their investments in 3g data networks similarly in ghana and uganda wireless service providers continue to build out their voice and data networks in order to satisfy increasing demand for wireless services in south africa where voice networks are in a more advanced stage of development carriers are beginning to deploy 3g data networks across spectrum acquired in recent spectrum auctions in mexico and brazil where nationwide voice networks have also been deployed some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3g data networks and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers to begin their initial investments in 3g data networks in markets such as chile peru and colombia recent or anticipated spectrum auctions are expected to drive investment in nationwide voice and 3g data networks in germany our most mature international wireless market demand is currently being driven by a governmentmandated rural fourth generation network buildout as well as other tenant initiatives to deploy next generation wireless services we believe incremental demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks  rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 8810 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio                     new sites acquired or constructed   2012     2011     2010     domestic     960       470       950     international1     7850       10000       6870       1 the majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2012 were in brazil germany india and uganda in 2011 were in brazil colombia ghana india mexico and south africa and in 2010 were in chile colombia india and peru  network development services segment revenue growth as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades  rental and management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance security and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities    32    table of contents reit conversion we began operating as a reit effective january 1 2012 the reit tax rules require that we derive most of our income other than income generated by a trs from investments in real estate which for us primarily consists of income from the leasing of our communications sites under the code maintaining reit status generally requires that no more than 25 of the value of the reits assets be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets  a reit must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid an aggregate of approximately 3556 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  for more information on the requirements to qualify as a reit see item 1 of this annual report under the caption businessoverview and item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsif we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available and certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities  nongaap financial measures  included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss from equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating expenses depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense  adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 it is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature and 5 it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of longterm strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company such as decisions with respect to capital structure capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate  our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap measure has been included below    33    table of contents results of operations

attributable to an increase in both of our rental and management segments including organic revenue growth attributable to our legacy sites and revenue growth attributable to the approximately 19280 new sites that we have constructed or acquired since january 1 2011  domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 11 to 19407 million this growth was comprised of            revenue growth from legacy sites of approximately 8 which includes approximately 2 attributable to contractual rent escalations net of tenant lease cancellations and

deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income so as to not be subject to income tax or excise tax on undistributed reit taxable income the amount timing and frequency of future distributions however will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset our distribution requirements

as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease      9 primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet primarily our straightline rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash      10 other noncurrent liabilities exclude 343 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and 287 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positions  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk  interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2012 we held ten interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which had an aggregate notional amount of 1073 million interest rates ranging from 578 to 725 and expiration dates through november 2020  factors affecting sources of liquidity  internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites  restrictions under loan agreements relating to the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan the loan agreements for the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below where we designate    52    table of contents  certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with each of these covenants            consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 600 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 we could incur approximately 25 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 412 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio            consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt as defined in the loan agreements to adjusted ebitda of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 we could incur approximately 34 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 25 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 11 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio            interest coverage ratio this ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 our interest expense which was 391 million for that period could increase by approximately 356 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 891 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio  the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants  any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for the credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants  restrictions under loan agreement relating to the securitization the loan agreement related to the securitization involves assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the borrowers through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the certificates as of december 31 2012 5278 broadcast and wireless communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries  the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent    53    table of contents  directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations  under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2012 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 5768 million  in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage dscr for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 175x or less the cash trap dscr then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters  additionally while the anticipated repayment date is not until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an amortization period under the securitization loan until april 2014 an amortization period would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 145x the minimum dscr  in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us  consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions pay reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers  as of december 31 2012 the borrowers dscr was 389x based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2012 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 2113 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 2409 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period  as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to    54    table of contents  raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program  in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement obligations accounting for acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2012 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result            impairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements to the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers an impairment charge is recognized for the towers and network location intangible assets we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment  we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the assets carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment    55    table of contents         impairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized  during the year ended december 31 2012 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for two reporting units whose fair value exceed the carrying value by approximately 872 million for these two reporting units we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions            a 5 reduction in projected net income or a 110 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or a 15 reduction in terminal sales growth rate  the goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated 419 million as of december 31 2012 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisitionss current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business            asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our obligation to retire tangible longlived assets and the related asset retirement costs which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or captured as a component of purchase accounting  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 66 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the change in 2012 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary    56    table of contents         acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price including any contingent consideration to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill for those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customerrelated and network location intangibles the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition the determination of the final purchase price and acquisitiondate fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized            revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease agreements excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancellable terms of the applicable leases total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximated 1658 million 1440 million and 1052 million respectively amounts billed upfront for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met  we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 51 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured            rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease we calculate our straightline ground rent over the term of the ground lease including all renewal options required    57    table of contents       to fulfill the tenant lease obligation in addition to the straightline ground rent expense recorded we also record an associated straightline rent liability in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation            stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period which generally represents the vesting period the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets            income taxes we will elect to be taxed as a reit under the code effective january 1 2012 and will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our qrss taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided we meet certain organization and operating requirements however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate at december 31 2011 we reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate as a reit we will not pay federal income tax on our qrss because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset our taxable income additionally we will be permitted to use nols to offset our reit taxable income we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income  we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2012 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 956 million on deferred tax assets for certain of our subsidiaries which primarily relates to foreign nols we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax asset primarily our foreign and federal nols related to other trs entities as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these nols during the applicable carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability  the recoverability of our us federal net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider an adjustment to our valuation allowances    58    table of contents changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position  we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit  we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 13 million as of december 31 2012 we have classified approximately 343 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 287 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations  from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2012  we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately 101 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the united states should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested

tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements    principles of consolidation and basis of presentationthe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest investments in entities that the company does not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method depending upon the companys ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated  significant accounting policies and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements the significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include impairment of longlived assets including goodwill asset retirement obligations revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation income taxes and accounting for business combinations the company considers events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued as additional evidence for certain estimates or to identify matters that require additional disclosure  changes in presentationchanges have been made to the presentation of the companys consolidated statements of equity for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 to be consistent with the current year presentation specifically other comprehensive income was previously reported in the aggregate but the individual components are now reported separately in the consolidated statements of equity  concentrations of credit riskthe company is subject to concentrations of credit risk related to its cash and cash equivalents notes receivable accounts receivable deferred rent asset and derivative financial instruments the company mitigates its risk with respect to cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments by maintaining its deposits and contracts at high quality financial institutions and monitoring the credit ratings of those institutions  the company derives the largest portion of its revenues corresponding accounts receivable and the related deferred rent asset from a relatively small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 51 of its revenues is derived from four customers in addition the company has concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas  the company mitigates its concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables and the related deferred rent assets by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of its borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue the company must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and

selfconstructed towers includes direct materials and labor capitalized interest and certain indirect costs associated with construction of the tower such as transportation costs employee benefits and payroll taxes the company begins the capitalization of costs during the preconstruction period which is the period during which costs are incurred to evaluate the site and continues to capitalize costs until the tower is substantially completed and ready for occupancy by a tenant labor costs capitalized for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 416 million 356 million and 319 million respectively interest costs capitalized for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were 19 million 21 million and 10 million respectively  expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred augmentation and improvements that extend an assets useful life or enhance capacity are capitalized  depreciation is recorded using the straightline method over the assets estimated useful lives towers and related assets on leased land are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the ground lease including renewal options and residual value or the estimated useful life of the tower  towers or assets acquired through capital leases are reflected in property and equipment at the present value of future minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease property and equipment network location intangibles and assets held under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets for periods up to twenty years  goodwill and other intangible assetsthe company reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the companys goodwill is recorded in its domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment the company utilizes the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test the company employs a discounted cash flow analysis    f11    table of contents american tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements     the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the company conducts the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized  during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test as the fair value of each of the reporting units was in excess of its carrying value  intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and are deemed to have a definite life are amortized over their useful lives generally ranging from three to twenty years and are evaluated separately for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  deferred rent assetthe companys deferred rent asset is associated with noncancellable tenant leases that contain fixed escalation clauses over the terms of the applicable leases  notes receivable and other noncurrent assetsnotes receivable and other noncurrent assets primarily represent the companys notes receivable from tv azteca investments accounted for under the equity method prepaid ground lease assets longterm deposits favorable leasehold interests and other noncurrent assets  derivative financial instrumentsall derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value derivatives in an asset position are reflected in notes receivable and other noncurrent assets and derivatives in a liability position are reflected in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets if a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss income and are recognized in the results of operations when the hedged item affects earnings ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized in the results of operations for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments changes in fair value are recognized in the results of operations in the period that the change occurs  the company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations the primary risk managed through the use of derivative instruments is interest rate risk from time to time the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure on the variable rate debt under its credit facilities and to manage variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments under these agreements the company is exposed to credit risk to the extent that a counterparty fails to meet the terms of a contract the companys credit risk exposure is limited to the current value of the contract at the time the counterparty fails to perform the company may also enter into forward starting interest rate swap agreements and treasury lock agreements which the company designates as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the likely issuance of new fixed rate debt settlement gains and losses on terminations of these forward starting interest rate swap agreements are recorded in other comprehensive income loss net of taxes and amortized to interest expense over the term of the newly issued debt  the company assesses both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes    f12    table of contents american tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements    the company may also enter into foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations these transactions do not typically qualify for hedge accounting and as a result the associated gains and losses are recognized in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations  fair value measurementsthe company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value the following are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value           level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date      level 2   observable inputs other than level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities      level 3   unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities  discount and premium on notesthe company amortizes the discounts and premiums on its notes using the effective interest method over the term of the obligation such amortization is reflected in interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  accounts payable and accrued expensesaccounts payable and accrued expenses primarily include amounts payable to vendors in the ordinary course and amounts payable to sellers in conjunction with acquisitions  asset retirement obligationsthe fair value of asset retirement obligations associated with an entitys obligation to retire tangible longlived assets is recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated such asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset and depreciated over the assets estimated useful life or captured as a component of purchase accounting fair value estimates of asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense adjustments are also made to the asset retirement obligation liability to reflect changes in the estimates of timing and amount of expected cash flows with an offsetting adjustment made to the related tangible longlived asset  the company has certain obligations related to tower assets which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of the companys tower assets are located which require the recognition of an asset retirement obligation the significant assumptions used in estimating the companys aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate the companys incremental borrowing rate  income taxesthe consolidated financial statements reflect provisions for federal state local and foreign income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets    f13    table of contents american tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements     and liabilities as a result of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date at december 31 2011 the company reversed its deferred tax assets and liabilities related to its reit activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate as a reit the company will not pay federal income tax with respect to its qrss because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset its taxable income additionally the company will be permitted to use net operating losses nols to offset its reit taxable income the company does not expect to pay federal income taxes on its reit taxable income  the company provides valuation allowances if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized within a reasonable period of time the company also periodically reviews its valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reduce these amounts to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized  the company classifies uncertain tax positions as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid within one year the company reports penalties and taxrelated interest expense as a component of the provision for income taxes and interest income from tax refunds as a component of other income in the consolidated statement of operations  other comprehensive loss incomeother comprehensive loss income refers to revenues expenses gains and losses that are included in other comprehensive loss income but excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to equity net of tax the companys other comprehensive loss income is comprised of changes in fair value of derivative cash flow hedges unrealized losses in availableforsale securities foreign currency translation adjustments and reclassification of unrealized losses on derivative cash flow hedges and availableforsale securities as summarized in the accompanying consolidated statement of other comprehensive loss income  treasury stockthe company records treasury stock purchases using the cost method whereby the purchase price including legal costs and commissions is recorded in a contra equity account treasury stock the equity accounts from which the shares were originally issued are not adjusted for any treasury stock purchases unless and until such time as the shares are formally retired as part of the reit conversion all treasury stock outstanding at the time was retired  distributionsa reit must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain during the year ended december 31 2010 a prereit year there were no cash distributions declared during the year ended december 31 2011 the company paid a onetime special cash distribution to its stockholders of approximately 1378 million or 035 per share of earnings and profits accumulated during the years it was taxed as a c corporation in anticipation of commencing to operate as a reit effective january 1 2012 during the year ended december 31 2012 the company declared and paid distributions of its reit taxable income of 3556 million or 090 per share the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond the companys control including the financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that the company otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments the companys ability to utilize nols to offset in whole or in part the companys distribution requirements limitations on its ability to fund distributions using cash generated through its trss and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant  acquisitionsfor transactions that meet the definition of a business combination the company allocates the purchase price including any contingent consideration to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the    f14    table of contents american tower corporation and subsidiaries  notes to consolidated financial statements     estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill for transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination the company first allocates the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customerrelated and network location intangibles the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired the company must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset adjusted for an estimated reduction in fair value due to depreciation and the economic useful life when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired the company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows the determination of the final purchase price and the acquisitiondate fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized in the prior period financial statements  revenue recognitionrental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease agreements excluding those tied to the consumer price index cpi or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease

consolidated balance sheet total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximated 1658 million 1440 million and 1052 million respectively amounts billed upfront for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the initial terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met  network development services revenues are derived under contracts or arrangements with tenants that provide for billings on a fixed price basis revenues are recognized as services are performed excluding certain fees for services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements which are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the initial terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met  rent expensemany of the leases underlying the companys tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable by the company over time the company calculates straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to the company such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured certain of the companys tenant leases require the company to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease the company calculates its straightline ground rent over the term of the ground lease including all renewal options required to fulfill the tenant lease obligation  total rental and management straightline ground rent expense approximated 337 million 310 million and 223 million for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition to the straightline ground rent expense recorded by the company the company also records its straightline rent liability in other noncurrent liabilities and records prepaid ground rent in prepaid and other current assets and notes receivable and other noncurrent assets in the accompanying

abandoned site and acquisition costs  stockbased compensationstockbased compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and this fair value is then recognized as an expense over the service period which generally represents the vesting period the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the company calculates the fair value of stock options using the blackscholes optionpricing model and the fair value of restricted stock units based on the fair value of the units at the grant date the companys stockbased compensation expense is recognized in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or capitalized as part of the companys cost to construct tower assets  litigation coststhe company periodically becomes involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to its business the company regularly monitors the status of pending legal actions to evaluate both the magnitude and likelihood of any potential loss the company accrues for these potential losses when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss or possible range of loss can be reasonably estimated should the ultimate losses on contingencies or litigation vary from estimates adjustments to those liabilities may be required the company also incurs legal costs in connection with these matters and records estimates of these expenses which are reflected in selling general administrative and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  other operating expensesother operating expenses includes the costs incurred by the company in conjunction with

amortization for impairment whenever events changes in circumstances or other evidence indicate that the carrying amount of the companys assets may not be recoverable  the company reviews its tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment on an individual tower basis impairments primarily result from a tower not having current tenant leases or from having expenses in excess of revenues the company monitors its customer related intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship the company assesses recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the related assets will be recovered either through projected undiscounted future cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets if the company determines that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the company will measure any impairment loss based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the assets fair market value as compared to the assets carrying value the company records any related impairment charge in the period in which the company identifies such impairment    f16    table of contents
