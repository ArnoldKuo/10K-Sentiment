  overview  we are a leading independent owner operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data and data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 98 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2013 through our network development services we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites since january 1 2012 we have been organized and have qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  our communications real estate portfolio of 67418 communications sites as of december 31 2013 includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2013 27739 towers domestically and 39330 towers internationally our portfolio also includes 349 das networks in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements and hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in october 2013 we significantly expanded our portfolio through our acquisition of mip tower holdings llc mipt a private reit and parent company to global tower partners gtp an owner and operator of approximately 5370 communications sites through its various operating subsidiaries in the united states costa rica and panama gtp also manages rooftops and holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we believe the acquisition provides us with key strategic and financial advantages due to the high quality of the assets which are in locations complementary to our portfolio for more information on our acquisition of mipt see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda  our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries trss the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include most of our network development services segment in addition we have included most of our international operations and managed networks business within our trss    1    table of contents we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss we changed the previous trs election for certain of our mexican subsidiaries to be treated as qrss as of march 1 2013 in addition we restructured certain of our domestic trss to be treated as qrss as of january 1 2014  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 98 97 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site real estate where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base including the assets acquired as part of our acquisition of mipt which are predominately located in key markets and have minimal overlap with our preexisting sites positions us well to benefit from the increasing demand of global wireless services we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable five to ten year term with multiple fiveyear renewal terms and lease payments that typically increase based on a fixed escalation approximately 3035 per year in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets based upon foreign currency exchange rates and tenant leases in place as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 23 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network churn has been approximately 12 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our comparable year ago period rental and management segment revenue            high operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through to our tenants            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites    2    table of contents our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enable us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 65 67 and 72 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany ghana india mexico panama peru south africa and uganda provides a source of growth and diversification including exposure to markets in various stages of wireless network development our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 33 30 and 26 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the provision of backup power through shared generators domestically  communications towers approximately 96 96 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular voice and data broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 83 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2013            international telefónica in brazil chile colombia costa rica germany mexico panama and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda nextel international in brazil chile and mexico grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico and vodafone in germany ghana india and south africa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 55 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate 349 das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states brazil chile ghana india and mexico we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants and currently operate such networks in the united states typically we design build and operate our das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or    3    table of contents       other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we are also currently evaluating other complementary network strategies such as small cell deployments in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states and certain international markets who own rooftops capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into a contract with a property owner pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid to that property owner by the wireless carriers and other tenants as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate infrastructure that may support our tenants networks in these areas            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements            shared generators we contract with certain of our tenants for the right to use shared backup power generators at a number of our sites in the united states  network development services  through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 2 3 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in the united states and in our international markets has    4    table of contents       resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier capital spending is being driven primarily by the buildout of fourth generation 4g networks while our international markets are in various stages of network development as of december 31 2013 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that many of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites            invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs and acquisitions such as our acquisition of mipt we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns by pursuing such investments this includes pursuing opportunities to invest in new site construction and acquisitions in our domestic market and in select international markets that we believe have a competitive wireless industry are attractive from a macroeconomic standpoint and have wireless carriers that are actively deploying wireless networks in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve upon our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis in addition our acquisition of mipt provided us with an opportunity to adopt best practices in an effort to further improve the efficiency of our operational performance            maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to our disciplined financial policies which are the foundation of our balance sheet management we believe that these policies result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade ratings our acquisition of mipt resulted in an increase in our total debt and as a result we ended 2013 with our net leverage outside of our longterm target range we remain committed to reducing our net leverage through a combination of debt repayment and our continued growth we continue to focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position and as of december 31 2013 had approximately 23 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio  capital allocation strategy  the objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital to maintain our reit status we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria while taking into account the repayment of debt to reduce our net leverage to be within our longterm target range accordingly we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and acquisitions in addition we intend to return our remaining excess capital if any to stockholders through our stock repurchase program or by declaring special distributions from time to time during 2013 we generated 16 billion of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 52 billion of investments including 45 billion of acquisitions and 7245 million of    5    table of contents  capital expenditures in addition in 2013 we repurchased 1450 million including commissions and fees of our common stock and paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 4347 million to our stockholders            capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we will seek to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criteria our risk adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as country risk counterparty risk and product line risk            return excess capital to stockholders if we have sufficient capital available to i satisfy our reit distribution requirements ii fund our capital expenditures iii repay debt to reduce our net leverage ratio toward our targeted range and iv fund anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return any excess capital to stockholders we typically have utilized a stock repurchase program to facilitate this return  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing independent wireless real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets which enables us to leverage multiple stages of wireless network development throughout our global footprint our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new market we review the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regime            wireless industry analysis to ensure sufficient demand to support an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include a country that has multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as deploying incremental spectrum from auctions that have occurred or are anticipated to occur            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with a competitive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our risk adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  recent transactions  acquisitions  from january 1 2013 through december 31 2013 we increased our communications site portfolio by approximately 13070 sites including approximately 2370 buildtosuits and we believe the assets acquired will be accretive to our consolidated operating margins acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013 included            we acquired approximately 880 communications sites in mexico from axtel sab de cv january 2013 approximately 1480 communications sites in mexico from nii holdings inc nii    6    table of contents       november 2013 and approximately 1940 communications sites in brazil from nii december 2013 these acquisitions strengthened our presence in our legacy markets by expanding our site portfolio by nearly 30 in latin america            through our acquisition of approximately 5370 communications sites from mipt in october 2013 we expanded our domestic portfolio by over 20 while also expanding our footprint in latin america the acquisition augmented our presence in the top 100 us btas where carriers have historically been most active in deploying their networks            other acquisitions of an aggregate of approximately 1030 communications sites in brazil chile colombia ghana mexico south africa and the united states  we continue to evaluate potential complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  financing transactions  during the year ended december 31 2013 we raised capital thereby increasing our financial flexibility and our ability to return value to our stockholders significant financing transactions in 2013 included those set forth below for more information about our financing transactions see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsliquidity and capital resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  securitization in march 2013 we completed a securitization transaction the securitization involving assets related to 5195 wireless and broadcast communications towers the secured towers owned by two of our special purpose subsidiaries through a private offering of 18 billion of secured tower revenue securities series 20131a and series 2013 2a collectively the securities we used the net proceeds from the securitization to refinance the 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 issued in the securitization transaction completed in may 2007 the certificates  senior notes offerings in january 2013 we completed a registered public offering of 10 billion aggregate principal amount of 350 senior unsecured notes due 2023 the 350 notes in august 2013 we completed a registered public offering of 750 million aggregate principal amount of 340 senior unsecured notes due 2019 the 340 notes and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 500 senior unsecured notes due 2024 the 500 notes we used the net proceeds from each of these notes offerings primarily to repay certain indebtedness under our existing credit facilities  credit facilities we increased our borrowing capacity and financial flexibility by entering into a multicurrency 15 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in june 2013 which was subsequently increased to 20 billion the 2013 credit facility and a 364day 10 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility in september 2013 the shortterm credit facility as a result as of december 31 2013 we had the ability to borrow up to 20 billion under our existing credit facilities net of any outstanding letters of credit we also entered into a 15 billion unsecured term loan in october 2013 the 2013 term loan and repaid our 7500 million unsecured term loan entered into in june 2012 the 2012 term loan  regulatory matters  towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 67 of our total rental and management    7    table of contents  revenue for the year ended december 31 2013 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the indian department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership to date such changes have not been formally adopted in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades for instance in june 2012 the chilean government passed legislation retroactively imposing certain zoning restrictions on telecommunications towers in response to which we developed a remediation plan existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations   8    table of contents portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our domestic and international tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure   competition  we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project  customer demand  our strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has increased from approximately 26 billion to over 30 billion over the last three years resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            wireless service provider focus on network quality and resulting investments in the coverage and capacity of their networks    9    table of contents         subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as mobile internet and video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            increasing wireless data usage continues to incentivize carriers to make incremental investments in their data networks            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video and            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments  we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks without the need for incremental cell sites the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies or the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investments away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside the providers license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition wireless carriers sharing their sites or permitting equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites    10    table of contents employees  as of december 31 2013 we employed 2716 fulltime individuals and consider our
