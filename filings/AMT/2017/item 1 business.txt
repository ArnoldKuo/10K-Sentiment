overviewwe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our property operations which accounted for 99 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2016 we also offer towerrelated services in the united states including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we refer to this business as our services operationsour portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements as well as distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold other telecommunications infrastructure and property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our communications real estate portfolio of 144884 communications sites as of december 31 2016 included 40414 communications sites in the us 57945 communications sites in asia 12861 communications sites in europe middle east and africa emea and 33664 communications sites in latin america american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations primarily through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development in 2016 we significantly expanded our asia segment portfolio by acquiring a 51 controlling ownership interest in viom networks limited viom a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india the viom acquisition subsequent to the closing viom was renamed atc telecom infrastructure private limited atc tipl in 2016 we launched operations in argentina a new market for us in december 2016 our newly formed joint venture in europe entered into a definitive agreement to acquire a tower company in france which is also a new market for us this acquisition closed in february 2017we operate as a real estate investment trust for us federal income tax purposes reit accordingly we generally are not subject to us federal income taxes on income generated by our reit operations including the income derived from leasing space on our towers as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our income and gains however we remain obligated to pay us federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable reit subsidiaries trss in addition our international assets and operations regardless of their designation for us tax purposes continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conductedthe use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements we may from time to time change the election of previously designated trss to be included as part of the reit as of december 31 2016 our reit qualified businesses included our us tower leasing business most of our operations in costa rica germany and mexico and a majority of our services segment and indoor das networks businesswe report our results in five segments  us property formerly referred to as domestic rental and management asia property emea property latin america property asia property emea property and latin america property were formerly referred to as international rental and management and services formerly referred to as network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report1table of contentsproducts and servicesproperty operationsour property operations accounted for 99 98 and 98 of our total revenues for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases our tenants lease space on our communications real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations and power and fuel costs some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants as well as property taxes and repairs and maintenance expenses our property operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristicslongterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable term of ten years with multiple renewal terms with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed escalation percentage averaging approximately 3 in the united states or an inflationary index in our international markets or a combination of both based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2016 we expect to generate over 31 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accountingconsistent demand for our sites as a result of rapidly growing usage of wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites we believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growthhigh lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn has been approximately 1 to 2 of total property revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or in limited circumstances when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced we derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our prior year property segment revenuehigh operating margins incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to gross margin and operating profit in addition in many of our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or power and fuel costs are reimbursed or shared by our tenant baselow maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sitesour property business includes the operation of communications sites managed networks the leasing of property interests fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generators our presence in a number of markets at different relative stages of wireless development provides us with significant diversification and longterm growth potential our property segments accounted for the

diverse range of communications services including cellular voice and data broadcasting mobile video and a number of other applications in addition in many of our international markets we receive additional passthrough revenue from our tenants to cover certain costs including power and fuel costs and ground rent our top tenants by revenue for each region are as follows for the year ended

report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange ratesmanaged networks property interests fiber and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide communications site management services to third parties manage and lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites lease fiber and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites managed networks we own and operate das networks in the united states and certain international markets we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants in the united states and in certain international markets typically we design build and operate our outdoor das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we also hold lease rights and easement interests on rooftops capable of hosting communications equipment in locations where towers are generally not a viable solution based on area characteristics in addition we provide management services to property owners in the united states who elect to retain full rights to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communications equipment installation as the demand for advanced wireless devices in urban markets evolves we continue to evaluate a variety of infrastructure solutions including small cells that may support our tenants networks in these areasproperty interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangementsfiber we own and operate fiber in argentina which we currently lease to operators to support their urban telecommunications infrastructure and expect to lease to operators in the future for additional fourth generation 4g and fifth generation 5g deployments shared generators we have contracts with certain of our tenants in the united states pursuant to which we provide access to shared backup power generatorsservices operationswe offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis services our services operations primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for 1 2 and 2 of our total revenue for each of the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectivelysite acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new communications sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site3table of contentsstructural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve onair readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third partiesstrategyoperational strategyour operational strategy is to capitalize on the global growth in the use of wireless services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices and the corresponding expansion of communications infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to achieve this our primary focus is to i increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio ii invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio iii further improve upon our operational performance and iv maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new and broader opportunities to enhance or extend our shared communications infrastructure businesses including those that may make our assets incrementally more attractive to new tenants or to existing tenants for additional uses and those that increase our operational efficiency increase the occupancy of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites increasing demand for wireless services in our served markets has resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carriers as a result we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and typically have capacity available for additional tenants in the united states incremental carrier network activity is being driven primarily by the buildout and densification of 4g networks while in our international markets carriers are deploying a combination of second generation 2g third generation 3g and 4g networks depending on the specific market as of december 31 2016 we had a global average of approximately 19 tenants per tower we believe that the majority of our towers have capacity for additional tenants and that substantially all of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sitesinvest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital expenditure program new site construction and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive riskadjusted returns by pursuing such investments in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases a significant portion of our inorganic growth has been focused on properties with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy levels and therefore drive strong returns on those assetsfurther improve upon our operational performance and efficiency we continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve efficiency and provide superior service to our tenants to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis maintain a strong balance sheet we remain committed to disciplined financial policies which we believe result in our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet and will support our overall strategy and focus on asset growth and operational excellence as a result of these policies we currently have investment grade credit ratings we continue to focus on maintaining a robust liquidity position and as of december 31 2016 had 36 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade credit ratings provide us consistent access to the capital markets and our liquidity provides us the ability to selectively invest in our portfolio capital allocation strategythe objective of our capital allocation strategy is to simultaneously increase adjusted funds from operations and our return on invested capital over the long term to maintain our qualification for taxation as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders annually an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for 4table of contentsdistributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain after complying with our reit distribution requirements and paying dividends on our preferred stock we plan to continue to allocate our available capital among investment alternatives that meet or exceed our return on investment criteria capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual capital expenditure program this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installationsacquisitions we intend to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet or exceed our riskadjusted return on investment criteria our riskadjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory conditions and industry riskreturn excess capital to stockholders if we have excess capital available after funding i our required distributions ii capital expenditures and iii anticipated future investments including acquisition opportunities we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholders including through our stock repurchase program international growth strategywe believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by either establishing a new or expanding our existing communications real estate leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our riskadjusted return objectives can be achieved we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by operating in a geographically diverse array of markets in a variety of stages of wireless network development our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses among otherscountry analysis prior to entering a new market we conduct an extensive review of the countrys historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals including inflation outlook and foreign currency exchange rate trends capital markets tax regime and investment alternatives and the general business political and legal environments including property rights and regulatory regimewireless industry analysis to confirm the presence of sufficient demand to support an independent tower leasing model we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless market such as the pricing environment past and potential industry consolidation and the stage of its wireless network development characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include i multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks and ii ongoing or expected deployment of incremental spectrum from recent or anticipated auctionsopportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with an attractive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating i the type of transaction ii its ability to meet our riskadjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved including the anticipated anchor tenant and iii how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the regionrecent transactionsacquisitions and joint venturewe increased our communications site portfolio by 45309 sites in 2016 including 1869 buildtosuits we believe these assets will be an important component of our longterm growth in 2016 we completed the viom acquisition which included approximately 42000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor das networks in india we also launched operations in argentina through the acquisition of comunicaciones y consumos sa cycsa which owned or operated urban telecommunications assets fiber and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation in addition we acquired an aggregate of 891 communications sites in the united states brazil chile germany mexico nigeria and south africa in 2016in december 2016 we entered into a joint venture atc europe to which we contributed our german business in exchange for an investment from our partner pggm atc europe will focus on pursuing telecommunications real estate investment opportunities in select countries in europe in december 2016 atc europe entered into a definitive agreement to purchase fps towers fps which owns and operates approximately 2400 wireless tower sites in france this transaction closed on february 15 20175table of contents we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business and generate returns that meet or exceed our criteria for more information about our acquisitions see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual reportfinancing transactionsduring 2016 to complement our operational strategy to selectively invest in and grow our communications real estate portfolio while maintaining our longterm financial policies we completed a number of key financing initiatives which among others included the following completing registered public offerings of an aggregate of 325 billion of senior unsecured notes the proceeds of which were used primarily to repay indebtedness under our existing revolving credit facilities and term loan borrowings under our revolving credit facilities were primarily used to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposesamending our existing revolving credit facilities and term loan to among other things extend each of the maturity

operationsliquidity and capital resources and note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual reportregulatory matterstowers and antennas our us and international tower leasing business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for 59 of our total property segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2016 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orderscertain of our international operations are subject to regulatory requirements with respect to licensing registration and permitting in india each of our operating subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi ipi registration certificate issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca in uganda our subsidiary holds a public infrastructure service license issued by the uganda communications commission ucc which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure and das networks for communication service providers licensed by the ucc in nigeria our subsidiary holds a license for infrastructure sharing and collocation services issued by the nigerian communications authority ncc which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure for communication service providers licensed by the ncc in chile our subsidiary is classified as a telecom intermediate service provider we have received a number of site specific concessions and are working with the chilean subsecretaria de telecommunicaciones to receive concessions on our remaining sites in chile cycsa holds a telecom license for a number of services it provides and is regulated by the ente nacional de comunicaciones enacom in argentina in many of the markets in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service providers on a nondiscriminatory basis subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there in addition 6table of contentscertain municipalities have sought to impose permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers or implements limitations on foreign ownershipin all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations while these regulations vary they typically require tower owners or tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades as well as adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects further additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or colocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites for example there are pending tower marking regulations in the united states compliance with which may result in a substantial increase in our costs environmental matters our us and international operations are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctionsadditionally in the united states and other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayedhealth and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposurecompetitionwe compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation telesites sab de cv and cellnex telecom sa wireless carrier tower consortia such as indus towers limited and private tower companies private equity sponsored firms carrieraffiliated tower companies independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sitesour services business competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants personnel we believe that our tenants base their decisions for services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project7table of contentscustomer demandour strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their networks in both our us and international markets while also investing in next generation data networks which will drive demand for our communications sites to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our services operations are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our services will continue consistent with industry trendsus wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has averaged 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our us communications sites is driven byincreasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service providers to focus on network quality and make incremental investments in the coverage and capacity of their networkssubscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications particularly mobile video increasingly advanced devices and the corresponding deployments and densification of advanced networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless datadeployment of newly acquired spectrum anddeployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrantsas consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless services in the united states grow wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverageinternational asia emea and latin america wireless network investments the wireless networks in most of our international markets are typically less advanced than those in our us market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven byincumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacityin certain of our international markets increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial and incremental data network deployments andthe increasing availability of lower cost smartphonesdemand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsif our tenants share site infrastructure to a significant degree or consolidate or merge our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected in addition the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites as set forth under the caption risk factorsnew technologies or changes in a tenants business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites employeesas of december 31 2016 we employed 4507 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be
