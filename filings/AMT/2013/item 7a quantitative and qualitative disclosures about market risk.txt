december 31 2012  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally any transaction denominated in a currency other than the us dollar is reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity and as a component of comprehensive income loss we may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions in order to minimize the risk of currency fluctuations  for the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 30 of our revenues and approximately 39 of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies as compared to 26 and 34 respectively during the same period in 2011  we have performed sensitivity analyses assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2012 and 2011 as of december 31 2012 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 5 as of december 31 2011 the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would cause our revenues operating results and cash flows to fluctuate by less than 4  as of december 31 2012 we have incurred a substantial amount of additional intercompany debt which is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being of longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income an adverse    61    table of contents  change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in approximately 1888 million of unrealized gains or losses that would be included in other expense income in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2012
