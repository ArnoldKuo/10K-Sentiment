  overview  we are a leading independent owner operator and developer of wireless and broadcast communications real estate our primary business is leasing antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 we also offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites effective january 1 2012 we reorganized to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes the reit conversion  our communications real estate portfolio of 54604 sites as of december 31 2012 includes wireless and broadcast communications towers and distributed antenna system das networks which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to longterm lease arrangements including as of december 31 2012 22534 towers domestically and 31789 towers internationally in addition our portfolio also includes 281 das networks that we operate primarily in malls and casinos and select outdoor environments we also manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as well as hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators  american tower corporation was originally created as a subsidiary of american radio systems corporation in 1995 and was spun off into a freestanding public company in 1998 since inception we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions longterm lease arrangements and site development  we are a holding company and conduct our operations through our directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures our principal domestic operating subsidiaries are american towers llc and spectrasite communications llc we conduct our international operations through our subsidiary american tower international inc which in turn conducts operations through its various international operating subsidiaries and joint ventures our international operations consist of our operations in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda  our continuing operations are reported in three segments domestic rental and management international rental and management and network development services for more information about our business segments as well as financial information about the geographic areas in which we operate see item 7 of this annual report under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we hold and operate certain of our assets through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries trss a trs is a subsidiary of a reit that is subject to applicable corporate income tax our use of trss enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with reit qualification requirements and also allows us to retain income generated by these businesses for reinvestment without the requirement of distributing those earnings the nonreit qualified businesses that we hold through trss include our network development services segment in addition we have included our international operations and managed networks business within our trss we are currently considering changing the election of one or more of our previously designated trss which hold certain of our international operations to be treated as qualified reit subsidiaries or other disregarded entities qrss and may reorganize and transfer certain assets or operations from our trss to other subsidiaries including qrss    1    table of contents as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income taxes on our income and gains that we distribute to our stockholders including the income derived from leasing towers however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  annually as a reit we are required to distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain our reit taxable income typically will not include income earned by our trss except to the extent the trss pay dividends in 2012 we paid regular cash distributions of an aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize net operating losses nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  products and services  rental and management operations  our rental and management operations accounted for approximately 97 98 and 98 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively our tenants lease space on our communications site infrastructure where they install and maintain their individual communications network equipment our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases the annual rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors including but not limited to tower location amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our tenant leases are typically noncancellable and have annual rent escalations our primary costs typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed with annual cost escalations property taxes and repairs and maintenance in most of our international markets a portion of our operating costs is passed through to our tenants such as ground rent or fuel costs our rental and management operations have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics            consistent demand for our sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites due to their attractive locations additionally we have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth            longterm tenant leases with contractual rent escalations in general a tenant lease has an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter and lease payments that typically increase based on a fixed escalation approximately 35 per year in the united states or inflationary index as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 20 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods absent the impact of straightline lease accounting            high lease renewal rates our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historical churn has been approximately 12 of total rental and management revenue per year we define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease and in very limited circumstances such as a tenant bankruptcy reductions in lease rates on existing leases we derive our historical churn rate for a given year by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our rental and management segment revenue    2    table of contents         high operating leverage incremental operating costs associated with adding new tenants to an existing communications site are relatively minimal therefore as additional tenants are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flows through to operating profit in addition in our international markets certain expenses such as ground rent or fuel costs are passed through to our tenants            low maintenance capital expenditures on average we require relatively low amounts of annual capital expenditures to maintain our communications sites our domestic rental and management segment is comprised of our nationwide network of communications sites that enables us to address the needs of national regional local and emerging communications service providers in the united states as well as customers in a number of other industries our domestic rental and management segment also includes property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators our domestic rental and management segment accounted for approximately 67 72 and 79 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  our international rental and management segment which is comprised of communications sites in brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda provides a source of diversification and growth our international rental and management segment accounted for approximately 30 26 and 19 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  our rental and management operations include the operation of wireless and broadcast communications towers and managed networks rooftop management the leasing of property interests and the installation of shared generators domestically  communications towers we own and operate communications towers in the united states brazil chile colombia germany ghana india mexico peru south africa and uganda approximately 96 98 and 98 of revenue in our rental and management segments was attributable to our communications towers for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   we lease real estate on our communications towers to tenants providing a diverse range of communications services including personal communications services cellular broadcasting enhanced specialized mobile radio wimax paging and fixed microwave our top domestic and international tenants by revenue are as follows            domestic atampt mobility sprint nextel verizon wireless and tmobile usa accounted for an aggregate of approximately 74 of domestic rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2012            international telefónica in brazil chile colombia mexico and peru mtn group limited in ghana south africa and uganda grupo iusacell sa de cv in mexico nextel international in brazil chile and mexico and vodafone in india germany ghana south africa and uganda accounted for an aggregate of approximately 55 of international rental and management segment revenue for the year ended december 31 2012  accordingly we are subject to certain risks as set forth in item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants and we are sensitive to changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants in addition we are subject to risks related to our international operations as set forth under the caption risk factorsour foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  managed networks rooftop management property interests and shared generators in addition to our communications sites we also own and operate several types of managed network solutions provide    3    table of contents  communications site management services to third parties manage andor lease property interests under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites and provide backup power sources to tenants at our sites            managed networks we own and operate 281 das networks primarily in malls and casinos in the united states mexico brazil ghana and india we obtain rights from property owners to install and operate inbuilding das networks and we grant rights to wireless service providers to attach their equipment to our installations we also offer outdoor das networks as a complementary shared infrastructure solution for our tenants and currently operate such networks in the united states typically we design build and operate our das networks in areas in which zoning restrictions or other barriers may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communications sites we are also currently evaluating other complementary network strategies such as small cell deployments            rooftop management we provide management services to property owners in the united states who own rooftops capable of hosting wireless communications equipment we obtain rights to manage a rooftop by entering into contracts with property owners pursuant to which we receive a percentage of occupancy or license fees paid by the wireless carriers and other tenants as urban markets continue to evolve we continue to evaluate infrastructure that may support additional services to meet the growing needs of our tenants networks            property interests we own a portfolio of property interests in the united states under carrier or other thirdparty communications sites which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangements            shared generators we install shared backup power generators at a number of our sites in the united states which we lease to our tenants to help reinforce their networks network development services  through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites this segment accounted for approximately 3 2 and 2 of our total revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively  site acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition services on our own behalf in connection with our tower development projects as well as on behalf of our tenants we typically work with our tenants engineers to determine the geographic areas where new tower sites will best address the tenants needs and meet their coverage objectives once a new site is identified we acquire the rights to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approvals are obtained to construct and operate the communications site  structural analysis we offer structural analysis services to wireless carriers in connection with the installation of their communications equipment on our towers our team of engineers can evaluate whether a tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenants to better assess potential sites before making an installation decision our structural analysis capabilities enable us to provide higher quality service to our existing tenants by among other things reducing the time required to achieve operational readiness while also providing opportunities to offer structural analysis services to third parties  strategy  operational strategy  our operational strategy is to capitalize on the growth in the use of wireless communications services and the evolution of advanced wireless handsets tablets and other mobile devices as well as the expanding  infrastructure required to deploy current and future generations of wireless communications technologies to    4    table of contents  achieve this our primary focus is to increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio further improve upon our operational performance and maintain a strong balance sheet we believe these efforts will further support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure            increase the leasing of our existing communications real estate portfolio we believe that our highest returns will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communications sites as a result of wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites because they are attractively located for wireless service providers and have capacity available for additional tenants as of december 31 2012 we had a global average of approximately 20 tenants per tower we believe that of our towers that are currently at or near full structural capacity the vast majority can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sales and marketing activities to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communications sites            invest in and selectively grow our communications real estate portfolio we seek opportunities to invest in and grow our operations through our capital programs and acquisitions we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted returns by pursuing such investments this includes pursuing opportunities to invest through new site construction and acquisitions in our domestic market and in select international markets which we believe have a competitive wireless industry where wireless carriers are deploying next generation technologies and are attractive from a macroeconomic standpoint in addition we seek to secure property interests under our communications sites to improve operating margins as we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground leases            further improve on our operational performance we will continue to seek opportunities to improve our operational performance throughout the organization this includes investing in our systems and people as we strive to improve our efficiencies and provide superior service to our customers to achieve this we intend to continue to focus on customer service such as reducing cycle times for key functions including lease processing and tower structural analysis            maintain a strong balance sheet we will continue to maintain our disciplined approach to managing our balance sheet this includes maintaining our net financial leverage ratio within a target range and ensuring ample liquidity is available to pursue our strategy as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 11 billion of available liquidity we believe that our investment grade ratings and our current level of net leverage provide us with consistent access to the capital markets and the ability to actively invest in our portfolio and pursue acquisition opportunities  capital allocation strategy  as a reit we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain which is our first priority within our capital allocation strategy after our reit distributions we expect to continue to deploy our discretionary capital through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program including land purchases and new site construction and through acquisitions the objective of our allocation of our discretionary capital is to simultaneously increase recurring free cash flow and our return on invested capital in addition we intend to return our remaining excess discretionary capital if any to stockholders through continuing our stock repurchase program or declaring special distributions from time to time during 2012 we generated 14144 million of cash from operating activities which along with incremental debt was used to fund nearly 29843 million of investments including 5680 million of capital expenditures 19980 million of acquisitions and 627 million of stock repurchases including commissions and fees during 2012 we paid regular cash distributions in the aggregate of approximately 3556 million to our stockholders            discretionary capital expenditure program we will continue to invest in and expand our existing communications real estate portfolio through our annual discretionary capital expenditure program    5    table of contents       this includes capital expenditures associated with maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing sites and projects such as new site construction land interest acquisitions and shared generator installations            acquisitions we will seek to pursue acquisitions of communications sites in our existing or new markets where we can meet our risk adjusted return on investment criteria our risk adjusted hurdle rates consider additional risks such as country risk counterparty risk and product line risk            return excess discretionary capital to stockholders if we have sufficient capital available to i satisfy our reit distribution requirements ii fund our discretionary capital expenditures and acquisition opportunities and iii fund anticipated future investment while remaining within our target leverage range we will seek to return any excess discretionary capital to stockholders we currently utilize a stock repurchase program to facilitate this return  international growth strategy  we believe that in certain international markets we can create substantial value by establishing an independent wireless infrastructure leasing business therefore we expect we will continue to seek international growth opportunities where we believe our risk adjusted return objectives can be achieved in addition we strive to maintain a diversified approach to our international growth strategy by complementing our presence in emerging markets with operations in more developed and established markets our international growth strategy includes a disciplined individualized market evaluation in which we conduct the following analyses            country analysis prior to entering a new geographic area we review the countrys political stability historical and projected macroeconomic fundamentals and the general business and legal environment including property rights and regulatory environment            wireless industry analysis to ensure sufficient demand for an independent tower company we analyze the competitiveness of the countrys wireless industry and the stage of its wireless network deployment characteristics that result in an attractive investment opportunity include a country that has multiple competitive wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as participating in spectrum auctions that have or are anticipated to occur            opportunity and counterparty analysis once an investment opportunity is identified within a geographic area with a competitive wireless industry we conduct a multifaceted opportunity and counterparty analysis this includes evaluating the type of transaction its ability to meet our risk adjusted return criteria given the country and the counterparties involved as well as how the transaction fits within our longterm strategic objectives including future potential investment and expansion within the region  growth and expansion  in 2012 we continued to focus on growing our operations using selective criteria for acquisitions including expansion into new international markets and new site development consistent with our international growth strategy during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our communications real estate portfolio through the acquisition and construction of approximately 8790 towers the installation of approximately 20 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites in the united states in addition we continue to evaluate complementary services to supplement our tower site growth and expansion strategy as well as opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios that we believe we can effectively integrate into our existing business united states we continued to build on our established foundation in the united states growing our domestic communications sites portfolio by 6 during the year ended december 31 2012 primarily through the acquisition and construction of communications sites in select locations throughout the country our expansion in    6    table of contents  the united states during 2012 included the acquisition and construction of approximately 945 towers the installation of approximately 15 inbuilding and outdoor das networks and the installation of approximately 600 shared generators on our sites international during 2012 we took additional steps to position ourselves for expansion into new international markets after announcing the launch of operations in uganda at the end of 2011 we acquired approximately 960 towers through our joint venture during the first half of 2012 in addition in november 2012 we announced that we had launched operations in germany and subsequently completed the purchase of approximately 2030 towers in the fourth quarter of 2012 thereby expanding our international footprint to ten countries as of december 31 2012 our international expansion efforts during 2012 also included the acquisition and construction in the aggregate of approximately 4855 towers and the installation of five inbuilding das networks in our existing markets  regulatory matters  towers and antennas our domestic and international tower business is subject to national state and local regulatory requirements with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our towers in the united states which accounted for approximately 69 of our total rental and management revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 the construction of new towers or modifications to existing towers may require preapproval by the federal communications commission fcc and the federal aviation administration faa depending on factors such as tower height and proximity to public airfields towers requiring preapproval must be registered with the fcc and painted lighted and maintained in accordance with faa standards similar requirements regarding preapproval of the construction and modification of towers are imposed by regulators in other countries noncompliance with applicable towerrelated requirements may lead to monetary penalties or site deconstruction orders  furthermore in india each of our subsidiaries holds an infrastructure provider categoryi license ipi issued by the indian ministry of communications and information technology which permits us to provide tower space to companies licensed as telecommunications service providers under the indian telegraph act of 1885 while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers as a condition to the ipi the indian government has the right to take over telecommunications infrastructure in the case of emergency or war in ghana our subsidiary holds a communications infrastructure license issued by the national communications authority nca which permits us to establish and maintain passive telecommunications infrastructure services and das networks for communications service providers licensed by the nca while we are required to provide tower space on a nondiscriminatory basis we may negotiate mutually agreeable terms and conditions with such service providers  our international business operations may be subject to increased licensing fees or ownership restrictions for example the telecom regulatory authority of india has recommended to the department of telecommunications changes in annual licensing fees for tower companies based on revenues generated as well as the potential implementation of certain limitations on foreign ownership in south africa the broadbased black economic empowerment act 2003 the bbbee act has established a legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizens disadvantaged by apartheid and accordingly the bbbee act and related codes measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metrics for companies that do business there certain municipalities in brazil and india have sought to impose certain permit fees based upon structural or operational requirements of towers in addition our foreign operations may be affected if a countrys regulatory authority restricts or revokes spectrum licenses of certain wireless service providers  in all countries where we operate we are subject to zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by local authorities or community organizations these regulations vary but typically require tower owners andor our tenants to obtain approval from local authorities or community standards organizations prior to tower    7    table of contents  construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authorities and community residents often oppose construction in their communities which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition zoning regulations can increase costs associated with new tower construction tower modifications and additions of new antennas to a site or site upgrades existing regulatory policies may adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such projects and additional regulations may be adopted that cause delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could materially and adversely affect our construction activities and operations in the united states the telecommunications act of 1996 prohibits any action by state and local authorities that would discriminate between different providers of wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communications sites it also prohibits state or local restrictions based on the environmental effects of radio frequency emissions to the extent the facilities comply with fcc regulations further in february 2012 the united states government adopted new regulations requiring that local and state governments approve modifications or collocations that qualify as eligible facilities under the regulations in june 2012 the chilean government passed a new law that imposes certain zoning restrictions retroactively on telecommunications towers located throughout chile and may require us to modify or remove certain of our existing towers  portions of our business are subject to additional regulations for example in a number of states throughout the united states certain of our subsidiaries hold competitive local exchange carrier clec status or other similar status in connection with the operation of our outdoor das networks business in addition we or our tenants both domestic and international may be subject to new regulatory policies in certain jurisdictions from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communications sites  environmental matters our domestic and international operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to various national state and local environmental laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes and the siting of our towers as an owner lessee andor operator of real property and facilities we may have liability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or waste certain of these laws impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination and whether or not we have discontinued operations or sold the property we also may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from offsite migration of contamination we may be required to obtain permits pay additional property taxes comply with regulatory requirements and make certain informational filings related to hazardous substances or devices used to provide power such as batteries generators and fuel at our sites violations of these types of regulations could subject us to fines or criminal sanctions  additionally in the united states and many other international markets where we do business before constructing a new tower or adding a new antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and we must disclose any significant impacts in an environmental assessment if a tower or new antenna might have a material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed  health and safety in the united states and in other countries where we operate we are subject to various national state and local laws regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure  competition  our rental and management segments compete both for new business and for the acquisition of assets with other public tower companies such as crown castle international corp sba communications corporation and gtl infrastructure wireless carrier tower consortiums such as indus towers and private tower companies    8    table of contents  independent wireless carriers tower owners broadcasters and owners of noncommunications sites including rooftops utility towers water towers and other alternative structures we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factors affecting owners operators and managers of communications sites  our network development services segment competes with a variety of companies offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site acquisition consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consultants structural engineering firms tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors who can provide turnkey site development services through multiple subcontractors and our tenants internal staffs we believe that our tenants base their decisions for network development services on various criteria including a companys experience local reputation price and time for completion of a project  customer demand  our strategy is predicated on our belief that wireless service providers will continue to invest in their networks in both our domestic and international markets driving demand for our communications sites            domestic wireless network investments according to industry data aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united states has historically been approximately 25 to 30 billion resulting in consistent demand for our sites demand for our domestic communications sites is driven by            wireless service provider focus on network quality and resulting investments in coverage and capacity of their network            subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data applications such as email and internet and the corresponding deployments of advanced wireless networks by wireless service providers to satisfy this incremental demand for highbandwidth wireless data            deployment of newly acquired spectrum and            deployment of wireless and backhaul networks by new market entrants  as these factors continue to grow as a competitive necessity in the united states on a widespread basis wireless service providers may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing networks and expand their network coverage            international wireless network investments the wireless networks in the international markets we serve are typically less advanced than those in our domestic market with respect to the density of voice networks and the current technologies generally deployed for wireless services accordingly demand for our international communications sites is primarily driven by            incumbent wireless service providers investing in existing voice networks to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity            in certain of our international markets subscriber adoption of wireless data applications such as email internet and video and            spectrum auctions which result in new market entrants as well as initial data network deployments  we believe demand for our communications sites will continue as wireless service providers seek to increase the quality coverage area and capacity of their existing networks while also investing in next generation data networks to meet these network objectives we believe wireless carriers will continue to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs as a means to accelerate access to their markets and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communications sites and maintain    9    table of contents  their own communications site operation and development capabilities in addition because our network development services are complementary to our rental and management business we believe demand for our network development services will continue consistent with industry trends  our customer demand could be adversely affected by the emergence and growth of new technologies which could make it possible for wireless carriers to increase the capacity and efficiency of their existing networks the increased use of spectrally efficient technologies andor the availability of significant incremental spectrum in the marketplace could potentially relieve a portion of our tenants network capacity problems and as a result could reduce the demand for towerbased antenna space additionally certain complementary network technologies such as small cell deployments could shift a portion of our tenants network investment away from the traditional towerbased networks which may reduce the need for carriers to add more equipment at certain communications sites  in addition any increase in the use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements by wireless service providers could adversely affect customer demand for tower space these arrangements enable a provider to serve its customers outside its license area to give licensed providers the right to enter into arrangements to serve overlapping license areas and to permit nonlicensed providers to enter the wireless marketplace consolidation among wireless carriers could similarly impact customer demand for our communications sites because the existing networks of wireless carriers often overlap in addition if wireless carriers share their sites or permit equipment location swapping on their sites with other carriers to a significant degree it could reduce demand for our communications sites further our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that may materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites   employees  as of december 31 2012 we employed 2432 fulltime individuals and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory  available
