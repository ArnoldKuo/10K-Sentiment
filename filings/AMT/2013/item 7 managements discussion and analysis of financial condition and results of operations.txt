antenna space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers radio and television broadcast companies wireless data providers government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries in addition to the communications sites in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements we also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and thirdparty tower operators we refer to this business as our rental and management operations which accounted for approximately 97 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2012 and includes our domestic rental and management segment and our international rental and management segment through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services domestically including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites we began operating as a reit for federal income tax purposes effective january 1 2012    29    table of contents the following table details the number of communications sites we own or operate in the countries in which we operate as of december 31 2012                 country   number ofowned sites     number ofoperated sites1     united

longterm capital leases including those subject to purchase options  the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are typically for an initial noncancellable term of five to ten years with multiple fiveyear renewal terms thereafter accordingly nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of december 31 2012 we expect to generate approximately 20 billion of noncancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods excluding the impact of straightline lease accounting in addition most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on a fixed percentage on average approximately 35 in the united states inflation or inflation with a fixed minimum or maximum escalation for the year revenue generated by rent increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the noncancellable term of the applicable agreement we also routinely seek to extend our leases with our tenants which increases the noncancellable term of the lease and creates incremental growth in our revenues  the revenues generated by our rental and management operations may also be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases as discussed above most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts which typically are noncancellable however in some instances a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee  revenue lost from either cancellations of leases at the end of their terms or rent negotiations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management operations during the year ended december 31 2012 loss of annual revenue from tenant lease cancellations or renegotiations represented less than 13 of our rental and management operations revenues  rental and management operations revenue growth the primary factors affecting the revenue growth for our domestic and international rental and management segments are            recurring revenues from tenant leases generated from sites which existed in our portfolio as of the beginning of the prior year period legacy sites            contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases net of cancellations            new revenue generated from leasing additional space on our legacy sites and            new revenue generated from new sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new sites    30    table of contents we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to meet that demand by adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our legacy sites which increases the utilization and profitability of our sites in addition we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers our legacy site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their networks as well as roll out next generation wireless technologies in addition we intend to continue to supplement the organic growth on our legacy sites by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment criteria  rental and management operations organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our legacy sites our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through collocation our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions the following key trends within each market that we serve provide opportunities for organic revenue growth            domestic as a result of the rapid subscriber adoption of wireless data applications wireless service providers in the united states continue to invest in their wireless networks by adding new cell sites as well as additional equipment to their existing cell sites this level of wireless communications services growth has driven wireless providers in the united states to deploy consistent levels of annual wireless capital investment and as a result we have experienced strong demand for our communications sites  we expect the following key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us            the deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and enable fixed broadband substitution as a result our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing networks            wireless service providers compete based on the overall capacity and coverage of their existing wireless networks to maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases our tenants continue to deploy additional equipment across their existing sites as well as add new cell sites            wireless service providers are also investing in reinforcing their networks through incremental backhaul and the utilization of onsite generators which results in additional equipment leased at the tower site            wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum and as a result are expected to add additional equipment to their network as they seek to optimize their network configuration  we signed holistic master lease agreements with three of our four major tenants in the united states which provide for consistent longterm revenue growth and a reduction in the potential impact of churn typically these agreements include builtin annual escalators fixed annual charges which permit our tenants to place a predetermined amount of equipment on our sites and provisions for incremental lease payments if the equipment levels are exceeded our holistic master lease agreements build and foster strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly deploy technology on our sites            international most of our international markets are less advanced with respect to the current technologies deployed for wireless services as a result demand for our communications sites is predominantly driven by continued voice network investments new market entrants and initial third generation 3g data network deployments for example in india nationwide voice networks    31    table of contents       continue to be deployed as wireless service providers are beginning their investments in 3g data networks similarly in ghana and uganda wireless service providers continue to build out their voice and data networks in order to satisfy increasing demand for wireless services in south africa where voice networks are in a more advanced stage of development carriers are beginning to deploy 3g data networks across spectrum acquired in recent spectrum auctions in mexico and brazil where nationwide voice networks have also been deployed some incumbent wireless service providers continue to invest in their 3g data networks and recent spectrum auctions have enabled other incumbent wireless service providers to begin their initial investments in 3g data networks in markets such as chile peru and colombia recent or anticipated spectrum auctions are expected to drive investment in nationwide voice and 3g data networks in germany our most mature international wireless market demand is currently being driven by a governmentmandated rural fourth generation network buildout as well as other tenant initiatives to deploy next generation wireless services we believe incremental demand for our tower sites will continue in our international markets as wireless service providers seek to remain competitive by increasing the coverage of their networks while also investing in next generation data networks  rental and management operations new site revenue growth during the year ended december 31 2012 we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through acquisitions and construction activities including the acquisition and construction of approximately 8810 sites in a majority of our international markets the acquisition or construction of new sites results in increased passthrough revenues and expenses we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire larger communications real estate portfolios both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio                     new sites acquired or constructed   2012     2011     2010     domestic     960       470       950     international1     7850       10000       6870       1 the majority of sites acquired or constructed in 2012 were in brazil germany india and uganda in 2011 were in brazil colombia ghana india mexico and south africa and in 2010 were in chile colombia india and peru  network development services segment revenue growth as we continue to focus on growing our rental and management operations we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our total revenues through our network development services segment we offer towerrelated services including site acquisition zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services which primarily support our site leasing business and the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites including in connection with provider network upgrades  rental and management operations expenses direct operating expenses incurred by our domestic and international rental and management segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent property taxes repairs and maintenance security and power and fuel costs some of which may be passed through to our tenants these segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expenses which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in general our domestic and international rental and management segments selling general administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our legacy sites and typically increase only modestly yearoveryear as a result leasing additional space to new tenants on our legacy sites provides significant incremental cash flow we may incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in geographic areas where we have recently launched operations or are focused on expanding our portfolio our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our legacy sites and can be temporarily diluted by our development activities    32    table of contents reit conversion we began operating as a reit effective january 1 2012 the reit tax rules require that we derive most of our income other than income generated by a trs from investments in real estate which for us primarily consists of income from the leasing of our communications sites under the code maintaining reit status generally requires that no more than 25 of the value of the reits assets be represented by securities of one or more trss and other nonqualifying assets  a reit must annually distribute to its stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of its reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain during the year ended december 31 2012 we paid an aggregate of approximately 3556 million in regular cash distributions to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors a number of which may be beyond our control including our financial condition and operating cash flows the amount required to maintain reit status and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt instruments our ability to utilize nols to offset in whole or in part our distribution requirements limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our trss and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant  for more information on the requirements to qualify as a reit see item 1 of this annual report under the caption businessoverview and item 1a of this annual report under the caption risk factorsif we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit we would be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates which would substantially reduce funds otherwise available and certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which reduce our cash flows and may have deferred and contingent tax liabilities  nongaap financial measures  included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and accretion as adjusted adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income before income loss on discontinued operations net income loss from equity method investments income tax provision benefit other income expense loss on retirement of longterm obligations interest expense interest income other operating expenses depreciation amortization and accretion and stockbased compensation expense  adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with gaap rather adjusted ebitda is presented as we believe it is a useful indicator of our current operating performance we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because 1 it is a key measure used by our management team for purposes of decision making and for evaluating the performance of our operating segments 2 it is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain debt covenants 3 it is widely used in the tower industry to measure operating performance as depreciation amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives particularly where acquisitions and nonoperating factors are involved 4 it provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period to period operating performance by eliminating items which are not operational in nature and 5 it provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of different companies by excluding the impact of longterm strategic decisions which can differ significantly from company to company such as decisions with respect to capital structure capital investments and the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate  our measurement of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net

247 this decrease was primarily attributable to our dividend paid deduction and decreased state taxes during the year ended december 31 2012 partially offset by an increase in foreign taxes and valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets arose primarily as a result of purchase accounting and existing nols which were generated partly from interest on intercompany debt  as a reit we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated in our qrss and in addition we are able to offset income in both our trss and qrss by utilizing our nols subject to specified limitations  the etr on income from continuing operations for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to

of which 636 million was held by our joint ventures historically it has not been our practice to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs however in the event that we do repatriate any funds we may be required to accrue and pay taxes  as a reit we are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90 of our reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain generally we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our reit taxable income so as not to be subject to the income or excise tax on undistributed reit taxable income in 2012 we declared aggregate distributions of 090 per share and made total distributions of 3556 million to our stockholders we intend to continue paying regular distributions in 2013 the amount timing and frequency of distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and will be based upon various factors see item 5 of this annual report under the caption

as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease      9 primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet primarily our straightline rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash      10 other noncurrent liabilities exclude 343 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and 287 million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe however based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes if any to previously recorded uncertain tax positions  offbalance sheet arrangements we have no material offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation sk  interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2012 we held ten interest rate swap agreements all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges and which had an aggregate notional amount of 1073 million interest rates ranging from 578 to 725 and expiration dates through november 2020  factors affecting sources of liquidity  internally generated funds because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management operations as of the end of 2012 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods accordingly a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites  restrictions under loan agreements relating to the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan the loan agreements for the 2011 credit facility the 2012 credit facility and the 2012 term loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis these include limitations on additional debt distributions and dividends guaranties sales of assets and liens the loan agreements also contain covenants that establish three financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage senior secured leverage and interest coverage as set forth below where we designate    52    table of contents  certain of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries in accordance with the respective agreements those subsidiaries are excluded for purposes of the covenant calculations as of december 31 2012 we were in compliance with each of these covenants            consolidated total leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of total debt to adjusted ebitda each as defined in the loan agreements of 600 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 we could incur approximately 25 billion of additional indebtedness and still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if we maintain our existing debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 412 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio            consolidated senior secured leverage ratio this ratio requires that we not exceed a ratio of senior secured debt as defined in the loan agreements to adjusted ebitda of 300 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 we could incur approximately 34 billion of additional senior secured debt and still remain in compliance with this ratio effectively however this ratio would be limited to 25 billion to remain in compliance with other covenants in addition if we maintain our existing senior secured debt levels and our expenses do not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 11 billion and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio            interest coverage ratio this ratio requires that we maintain a ratio of adjusted ebitda to interest expense as defined in the loan agreements of not less than 250 to 100 based on our financial performance for the 12 months ended december 31 2012 our interest expense which was 391 million for that period could increase by approximately 356 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio in addition if our interest expense does not change materially from current levels our revenues could decrease by approximately 891 million and we would still remain in compliance with this ratio  the loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods if we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis we would be in breach of these covenants  any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities but would constitute a default under these credit facilities which could result in among other things the amounts outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fees becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for the credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations based upon our current expectations we believe our operating results during the next twelve months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants  restrictions under loan agreement relating to the securitization the loan agreement related to the securitization involves assets related to 5295 broadcast and wireless communications towers owned by two special purpose subsidiaries of the company the borrowers through a private offering of 175 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20071 the certificates as of december 31 2012 5278 broadcast and wireless communications towers are owned by the two special purpose subsidiaries  the securitization loan agreement includes certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets the borrowers organizational documents contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent    53    table of contents  directors the securitization loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the securitization loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers including the right to conduct site investigations  under the terms of the securitization loan agreement the loan will be paid solely from the cash flows generated by the towers subject to the securitization which must be deposited and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the securitization loan the borrowers are required to make monthly payments of interest on the securitization loan on a monthly basis all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the securitization loan referred to as excess cash flow is to be released to the borrowers for distribution to us during the year ended december 31 2012 the borrowers distributed excess cash to us of approximately 5768 million  in order to distribute this excess cash flow to us the borrowers must maintain several specified ratios with respect to their debt service coverage dscr for this purpose dscr is tested as of the last day of each calendar quarter and is generally defined as four times the borrowers net cash flow for that quarter divided by the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers must pay over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan pursuant to one such test if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter were 175x or less the cash trap dscr then all excess cash flow would be placed in a reserve account and would not be released to the borrowers for distribution to us until the dscr exceeded the cash trap dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters  additionally while the anticipated repayment date is not until april 2014 excess cash flow would be applied to principal during an amortization period under the securitization loan until april 2014 an amortization period would commence under the securitization loan if the dscr as of the end of any calendar quarter fell below 145x the minimum dscr  in such a case all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve account because the cash trap dscr was not met would be applied to pay principal of the securitization loan on each monthly payment date until the dscr exceeded the minimum dscr for two consecutive calendar quarters and so would not be available for distribution to us  consequently a failure to comply with the covenants in the securitization loan agreement could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers additionally a failure to meet the noted dscr tests could prevent the borrowers from distributing excess cash flow to us which could affect our ability to fund our discretionary expenditures including tower construction and acquisitions pay reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program in addition if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers  as of december 31 2012 the borrowers dscr was 389x based on the borrowers net cash flow for the calendar quarter ended december 31 2012 and the amount of interest servicing fees and trustee fees payable over the succeeding 12 months on the securitization loan the borrowers could endure a reduction of approximately 2113 million in net cash flow before triggering a cash trap dscr and approximately 2409 million in net cash flow before triggering an amortization period  as discussed above we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance and repurchase our outstanding indebtedness in addition in order to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements and fund our stock repurchase program we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to    54    table of contents  raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditures future growth and expansion initiatives satisfy our reit distribution requirements refinance our existing indebtedness or fund our stock repurchase program  in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities as set forth under the caption risk factors in part i item 1a of this annual report on form 10k we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and consequently a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity  critical accounting policies and estimates  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis including those related to impairment of assets asset retirement obligations accounting for acquisitions revenue recognition rent expense stockbased compensation and income taxes management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december 31 2012 we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for managements judgment in its application there are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result            impairment of assetsassets subject to depreciation and amortization we review longlived assets including intangibles for impairment at least annually or whenever events changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable we review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indications of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows typically at an individual tower basis possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues a cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates among other items the tower location the tower location demographics the timing of additions of new tenants lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements to the extent that cash flows generated under this approach are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the towers an impairment charge is recognized for the towers and network location intangible assets we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment  we monitor our customerrelated intangible assets on a customer by customer basis for indications of impairment such as high levels of turnover or attrition nonrenewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows if we determine that the carrying value of the customerrelated intangible asset may not be recoverable we measure any impairment based on the fair value of the asset as determined by the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset as compared to the assets carrying value we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment    55    table of contents         impairment of assetsgoodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually as of december 31 or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  goodwill is recorded in our domestic and international rental and management segments and network development services segment we utilize the two step impairment test when testing goodwill for impairment when conducting this test we employ a discounted cash flow analysis the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sales growth rate managements expectations of future operating results and cash requirements the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows to the carrying value of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying value exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting units goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized  during the year ended december 31 2012 no potential impairment was identified under the first step of the test the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying value and passed with a substantial margin except for two reporting units whose fair value exceed the carrying value by approximately 872 million for these two reporting units we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that none of the following negative changes in our assumptions individually which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusions            a 5 reduction in projected net income or a 110 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or a 15 reduction in terminal sales growth rate  the goodwill recorded in these two reporting units approximated 419 million as of december 31 2012 and is the result of recently completed acquisitions accordingly the sensitivity of projections to changes in the various assumptions is due in part to the timing of the underlying acquisitionss current levels of cash flows and amounts of cash flows generated in excess of the planned amounts due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the measurement date the fair value of intangible assets and goodwill used to test for impairment is in line with the fair value used to initially measure the business            asset retirement obligations we recognize asset retirement obligations associated with our obligation to retire tangible longlived assets and the related asset retirement costs which are principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligations estimated settlement date the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives or captured as a component of purchase accounting  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of 66 million during the year ended december 31 2012 the change in 2012 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals cost of tower removals timing and number of land lease renewals expected inflation rates and creditadjusted riskfree interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumptions are appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary    56    table of contents         acquisitions for those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price including any contingent consideration to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition with any excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill for those transactions that do not meet the definition of a business combination we allocate the purchase price to property and equipment for the fair value of the towers and to identifiable intangible assets primarily acquired customerrelated and network location intangibles the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods when determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future customer cash flows including rate and terms of renewal and attrition the determination of the final purchase price and acquisitiondate fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed may extend over more than one period and result in adjustments to the preliminary estimate recognized            revenue recognition rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned and when collectability is reasonably assured regardless of whether the payments from the tenants are received in equal monthly amounts fixed escalation clauses present in noncancellable lease agreements excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflationbased indices and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants are recognized on a straightline basis over the fixed noncancellable terms of the applicable leases total rental and management straightline revenues for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximated 1658 million 1440 million and 1052 million respectively amounts billed upfront for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition has been met  we derive the largest portion of our revenues corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry and approximately 51 of our revenues are derived from four tenants in the industry in addition we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas we mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the credit worthiness of our borrowers and tenants in recognizing customer revenue we must assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straightline basis this assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectability of the amounts billed to the extent the amounts based on managements estimates may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated losses resulting from a tenants inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured            rent expense many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time we calculate straightline ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed noncancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option for towers with these types of tenant leases at the inception of the ground lease we calculate our straightline ground rent over the term of the ground lease including all renewal options required    57    table of contents       to fulfill the tenant lease obligation in addition to the straightline ground rent expense recorded we also record an associated straightline rent liability in other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets leases may contain complex terms that often are subject to interpretation            stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation cost at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and the fair value is recognized as an expense over the service period which generally represents the vesting period the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will not fully vest and be forfeited the fair value of a stock option is determined using a blackscholes optionpricing model that takes into account a number of assumptions at the accounting measurement date including the stock price the exercise price the expected life of the option the volatility of the underlying stock the expected distributions and the riskfree interest rate over the expected life of the option these assumptions are highly subjective and could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date we recognize stockbased compensation in either selling general administrative and development expense costs of operations or as part of the costs associated with the construction of our tower assets            income taxes we will elect to be taxed as a reit under the code effective january 1 2012 and will generally not be subject to federal and state income taxes on our qrss taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders provided we meet certain organization and operating requirements however even as a reit we will remain obligated to pay income taxes on earnings from our trs assets in addition our international assets and operations continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted  accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes to the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for book purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax purposes deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns which may differ from the current rate at december 31 2011 we reversed deferred tax assets and liabilities related to our reit activities as a result of a reduction of the expected tax rate as a reit we will not pay federal income tax on our qrss because a dividends paid deduction will be available to offset our taxable income additionally we will be permitted to use nols to offset our reit taxable income we do not expect to pay federal taxes on our reit taxable income  we periodically review our deferred tax assets and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized as of december 31 2012 we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately 956 million on deferred tax assets for certain of our subsidiaries which primarily relates to foreign nols we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax asset primarily our foreign and federal nols related to other trs entities as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these nols during the applicable carryforward period valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability  the recoverability of our us federal net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations accordingly the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material asset sales or other nonroutine transactions based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future we will be required to reassess our deferred tax assets and consider an adjustment to our valuation allowances    58    table of contents changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position  we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when in managements judgment it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit  we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to 13 million as of december 31 2012 we have classified approximately 343 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet we also classified approximately 287 million of accrued income taxrelated interest and penalties as other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2012  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws regulations and administrative practices in a multitude of jurisdictions across our operations  from time to time we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december 31 2012  we consider the earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs we have not recorded a deferred tax liability related to the us federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately 101 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside of the united states should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings we may have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside of the united states    59    table of contents
