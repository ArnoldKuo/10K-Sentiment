interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt we seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest ratesas of december 31 2016 approximately 16 of our total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents as such changes in interest rates will impact interest income as discussed below fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates  as of december 31 2016 the balance of our government bond and corporate debt securities was 92 billion which represented approximately 82 of our total cash and investments investments in both fixedrate and floatingrate interestearning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk the fair market value of our fixedrate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates in general fixedrate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interestrate risk than those with shorter maturities while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interestrate risk than fixedrate securities floatingrate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase due in part to these factors our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 we have 90 billion of outstanding senior notes of which 91 bore interest at fixed rates we entered into 24 billion of interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with 115 billion of our 22 senior notes due july 2019 750 million of our 2875 senior notes due july 2021 and 500 million of our 3450 senior notes due july 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on libor plus a spread further changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility which bear interest at floating rates and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and accordingly will impact interest expense for additional details related to our debt please see note 11  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report investment riskthe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective we maintain our cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of asset types including bank deposits government bonds and corporate debt securitiesas of december 31 2016 our cost and equity method investments totaled 118 million which represented approximately 1 of our total cash and investments and were primarily related to equity method investments in privately held companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data foreign currency riskour commerce platforms operate globally resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound korean won and australian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities54we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts the effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting subsequent to the distribution fewer of our currency flows meet the us gaap criteria for cash flow hedge accounting while economically we face the same currency risks our statement of income is more subject to volatility due to currency fluctuations these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our derivative instruments please see note 9  derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in this report we use foreign exchange derivative contracts and invest nonus cash in us denominated investments to ultimately protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes for qualifying cash flow hedges the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts if any is recorded immediately in earnings for contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the derivatives gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income however only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting certain of our foreign subsidiaries hold us denominated marketable securities the us dollareuro is the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities these marketable securities are classified as availableforsale and as such fluctuations in the foreign exchange are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated balance sheet these fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other net in the period in which the marketable securities are sold the realized foreign exchange gains and losses on these securities offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations in earnings for the company the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities and the beforetax effect on fair values of a hypothetical adverse change in the foreign exchange rates that existed as of december 31 2016 the sensitivities for foreign currency contracts and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities are based on a 20 adverse change in foreign exchange rates against relevant functional currencies fair value assetliability fair value sensitivity 1 in millionsforeign exchange contracts  cash flow hedges64 126marketable securities878 176 1a hypothetical adverse change of 20 in the foreign exchange rates as of december 31 2016 would have resulted in a beforetax loss of 126 million and 176 million to be recorded in aoci related to foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securitiessince our risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposurein addition we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other net which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 10 million as of 55december 31 2016 taking into consideration the offsetting effect of foreign exchange forwards in place as of december 31 2016
