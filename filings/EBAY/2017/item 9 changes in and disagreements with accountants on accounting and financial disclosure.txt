business results of operations and financial condition as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report for important information regarding risks that affect usrisk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition our operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock and debt securities our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this risk factors section it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings loss accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance we do not have backlog and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales during that quarter due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock and debt securities could decline perhaps substantially as a result of the factors described in this paragraphsubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our businessthe businesses and markets in which we operate are intensely competitive we currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants the internet and mobile networks provide new rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services we compete in twosided markets and must attract both buyers and sellers to use our platforms consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through us have more and more alternatives and merchants have more channels to reach consumers we expect competition to continue to intensify online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other and our competitors include a number of online and offline retailers with significant resources large user communities and wellestablished brands moreover the barriers to entry into these channels can be low and businesses easily can launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommerce companies as we respond to changes in the competitive environment we may from time to time make pricing service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among sellers which could reduce activity on our platform and harm our profitabilitywe face increased competitive pressure online and offline in particular the competitive norm for and the expected level of service from ecommerce and mobile commerce has significantly increased due to among other factors improved user experience greater ease of buying goods lower or no shipping costs faster shipping times and more favorable return policies also certain platform businesses such as alibaba apple google and facebook many of whom are larger than us or have greater capitalization have a dominant and secure position in other industries or certain significant markets and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer if we are unable to change our products offerings and services in ways that reflect the changing demands of ecommerce and mobile commerce marketplaces particularly the higher growth of sales of fixedprice items and higher expected service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses our business will suffercompetitors with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can other competitors may offer or continue to offer faster andor free shipping delivery on sunday sameday delivery favorable return policies or other transactionrelated services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match competitors may be able to innovate faster and more efficiently and new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lowercost services9some of our competitors control other products and services that are important to our success including credit card interchange internet search and mobile operating systems such competitors could manipulate pricing availability terms or operation of service related to their products and services in a manner that impacts our competitive offerings for example google which operates a shopping platform service has from time to time made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to us from searches on google if we are unable to use or adapt to operational changes in such services we may face higher costs for such services face integration or technological barriers or lose customers which could cause our business to suffer consumers who might use our sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives including traditional department warehouse boutique discount and general merchandise stores as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers online retailers and their related mobile offerings online and offline classified services and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks in the united states these include amazoncom facebook google walmart target sears macys jc penney costco office depot staples officemax sams club rakuten yahoo shopping msn qvc and home shopping network among others in addition consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories of products offered on our siteconsumers also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes including social media online aggregation and classifieds platforms such as craigslist oodlecom and a number of international websites operated by schibsted asa or naspers limited consumers also can turn to shoppingcomparison sites such as google shopping in certain markets our fixedprice listing and traditional auctionstyle listing formats increasingly are being challenged by other formats such as classifiedsour classifieds platforms offer classifieds listings in the united states and a variety of international markets in many markets in which they operate our classifieds platforms compete for customers and for advertisers against more established online and offline classifieds platforms or other competing websitesour online shopping comparison websites shoppingcom compete with sites such as google shopping rakuten nextagcom pricegrabbercom shopzilla buscapé in latin america owned by naspers and yahoo product search which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products in addition sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels including the acquisition of new customers by paying for searchrelated advertisements on horizontal search engine sites such as google yahoo naver and baidu we use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations consumers may choose to search for products and services with a horizontal search engine or shopping comparison website and such sites may also send users to other shopping destinationsconsumers and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives including general ecommerce sites such as amazon and alibaba and more specialized sites such as etsy our international sites also compete for sellers with general and specialized ecommerce sites sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels such as classifieds platforms consumers and merchants also can create and sell through their own sites and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services in some countries there are online sites that have larger customer bases and greater brand recognition as well as competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce we increasingly may compete with local competitors in developing countries that have unique advantages such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authoritiesin addition certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels such as our sites manufacturers may attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goods or services manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our platforms or on the internet generally or at prices that would make us less attractive relative to other alternatives the adoption by manufacturers of policies or their use of laws or regulations in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services over the internet could force our users to stop selling certain products on our platforms which could result in reduced operating margins loss of market share and diminished value of our brands 10the principal competitive factors for us include the following  ability to attract retain and engage buyers and sellersvolume of transactions and price and selection of goodstrust in the seller and the transactioncustomer service brand recognition community cohesion interaction and sizewebsite mobile platform and application easeofuse and accessibilitysystem reliability and securityreliability of delivery and payment including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returnslevel of service fees andquality of search toolswe may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we doglobal and regional economic conditions could harm our businessour operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse economic conditions and events including volatility or distress in the equity andor debt or credit markets have in the past negatively impacted regional and global financial markets and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future these events and conditions including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union could have a negative and adverse impact on companies and customers with which we do business or cause us to write down our assets or investments in addition financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business the banking system or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerce platforms we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange ratesbecause we generate the majority of our revenues outside the united states but report our financial results in us dollars our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or foreign exchange rates the results of operations of many of our internationally focused platforms are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars for financial reporting purposes if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased us dollar denominated revenues and expenses similarly if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies particularly the euro british pound korean won or australian dollar our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower us dollar denominated net revenues and expenses in addition to this translation effect a strengthening us dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by us sellers to europe and australia more than it positively affects the volume of goods being sold by sellers in those geographies to buyers in the united states thereby further negatively impacting our financial results while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results which may have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securities11our international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our businessour international businesses especially in the united kingdom germany australia and korea and crossborder business from greater china have generated a majority of our net revenues in recent years in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally includinguncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the united kingdoms vote to exit the european unionuncertainty regarding how the united kingdoms access to the european union single market and the wider trading legal regulatory and labor environments especially in the united kingdom and european union will be impacted by the united kingdoms vote to exit the european union including the resulting impact on our business and that of our clientsexpenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences eg payment methods with which we may have limited or no experiencetrade barriers and changes in trade regulationsdifficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance language and cultural differencesstringent local labor laws and regulationscredit risk and higher levels of payment

stringent user protection data protection privacy and other laws risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local lawsnational or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rateslocal licensing and reporting obligations andincreased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and could harm our business any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our businesscrossborder trade is an important source of both revenue and profits for us crossborder trade also represents our primary or in some cases only presence in certain important markets such as brazillatin america china and various other countries in addition our crossborder trade is also subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations the interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products selective distribution networks and sellers in other countries listing items on the internet and the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the buyer the seller andor the location of the item being sold are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade the interpretation andor application of such laws could impose restrictions on or increase the costs of purchasing selling shipping or returning goods across national borders12 the shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping customs and duty procedures and reviews including dutyfree thresholds in various key markets the interaction of national postal systems and security related governmental processes at international borders may increase costs discourage crossborder purchases delay transit and create shipping uncertainties any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade or restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and could harm our business our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events natural disasters seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications including increased usage of other websitesour users may spend less time on our websites and our applications for mobile devices as a result of a variety of diversions including geopolitical events such as war the threat of war or terrorist activity natural disasters power shortages or outages major public health issues including pandemics social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications significant local national or global events capturing the attention of a large part of the population and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors if any of these or any other factors divert our users from using of our websites or mobile applications our business could be materially adversely affected our success depends to a large degree on our ability to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devicesmobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions a significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms through mobile devices we may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users mobile and multiscreen experience expectations the variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment in addition a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile marketsour ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success and any failure to continuously increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could harm our businessif we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative programs products and services the use of our products and our revenues could declinerapid significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industrywide standards new laws and regulations resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties intellectual property rights our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standardsour business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversightwe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas including consumer protection data privacy requirements intellectual property ownership and infringement prohibited items and stolen goods resale of event tickets tax anticompetition export requirements anticorruption labor advertising digital content real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media environmental and health and safety regulations as well as laws and regulations intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities13compliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions or cause us to change or limit our business practices we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures regulation in the areas of privacy and protection of user data could harm our business we are subject to laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users around the world much of the personal information that we collect especially financial information is regulated by multiple laws user data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations these laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and that may harm our businessregulatory scrutiny of privacy user data protection use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis we are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions some of these laws impose requirements that are inconsistent with one another yet regulators may claim that both apply complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacyrelated laws can result in significant penalties in addition compliance with these laws may restrict our ability to provide services to our customers that they may find to be valuable a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communicationsbased laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business in particular because of the enormous number of texts emails and other communications we send to our users communications laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation such as those described below could result in particularly large awards or finesfor example the federal communications commission amended certain of its regulations under the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones under the tcpa plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations we are regularly subject to classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that our businesses violated the tcpa these lawsuits and other private lawsuits not currently alleged as class actions seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the enormous number of communications we send to our users a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our businesswe post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal state or international privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others eg class action privacy litigation subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase our costs and adversely affect our business data collection privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern if internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites mobile platforms products and services as a result of these concerns our business could be harmed as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these laws14other laws and regulations could harm our businessit is not always clear how laws and regulations governing matters relevant to our business such as property ownership copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property issues parallel imports and distribution controls taxation libel and defamation and obscenity apply to our businesses many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet mobile and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies many of these laws including some of those that do reference the internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws and regulations as our activities the products and services we offer and our geographical scope continue to expand regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to additional requirements including licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction either generally or with respect to certain actions financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our businesses our success and increased visibility have driven some existing businesses that perceive us to be a threat to their businesses to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators these businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing parallel imports professional seller obligations selective distribution networks stolen goods copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues any changes to the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for thirdparty listings could negatively impact our businessnumerous us states and foreign jurisdictions including the state of california have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon us or our users and others may attempt to do so in the future attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues such as forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations we could also be subject to fines or other penalties and any of these outcomes could harm our businessa number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our platforms subject to unfavorable local laws for example trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holders consent the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations our business could be harmedas we expand and localize our international activities we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction for example we were found liable in france under french law for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers or sellers laws regulating internet mobile and ecommerce technologies outside of the united states are generally less favorable to us than those in the united states compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business in addition we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us eg in crossborder trade our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions15we are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory disputes and government inquiries we are regularly subject to claims lawsuits including class actions and individual lawsuits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy consumer protection accessibility claims securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users services and other matters the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products and services have increased in complexitythe outcome and impact of such claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that is subject to judgment calls it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could harm our business these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could harm our business we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition lawswe are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the united states individual states the european commission or other countries or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities including increased scrutiny in large markets such as china our business partnerships or agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the united states may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries such claims and investigations even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practiceswe are subject to patent litigationwe have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents we are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasonsour products and services continue to expand in scope and complexitywe continue to expand into new businesses including through acquisitions andthe universe of patent owners who may claim that we any of the companies that we have acquired or our customers infringe their patents and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners continues to increasesuch claims may be brought directly against us andor against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business16we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which if not remediated could adversely affect our reputation business or stock pricein reviewing the accounting for certain transactions we completed in december 2016 as part of the realignment of our legal structure as described below under the caption managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  provision for income taxes our management identified a deficiency in the effectiveness of a control intended to properly document and review relevant facts and apply the appropriate tax accounting under standards generally accepted in the united states of america which impacted the deferred tax asset and income tax benefit accounts and related disclosures as described under item 9a  controls and procedures our management has concluded that the deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and as a result internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2016a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis although we have developed and are implementing a plan to remediate this material weakness and believe based on our evaluation to date that this material weakness will be remediated during 2017 we cannot assure you that this will occur within the contemplated timeframe moreover we cannot assure you that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future if we are unable to remediate the material weakness our ability to record process and report financial information accurately and to prepare financial statements within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the securities and exchange commission could be adversely affected the occurrence of or failure to remediate the material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of our common stock and any other securities we may issuewe are exposed to fluctuations in interest ratessome of our borrowings bear interest at floating rates and we have entered into agreements intended to convert the interest rate on some of our fixed rate debt instruments to floating rates to the extent that prevailing rates increase our interest expense under these debt instruments will increaseinvestments in both fixedrate and floatingrate interestearning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk the fair market value of our fixedrate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates in general fixedrate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interestrate risk than those with shorter maturities while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interestrate risk than fixedrate securities floatingrate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase due in part to these factors our investment income may decline or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates in addition relatively low interest rates limit our investment income fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost of our current or future indebtedness cause the market value of our assets to decline or reduce our investment income could adversely affect our financial resultsour tickets business is subject to regulatory competitive and other risks that could harm this businessour tickets business which includes stubhub is subject to numerous risks including some jurisdictions in particular jurisdictions outside the united states prohibit the resale of event tickets antiscalping laws at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all or highly regulate the resale of tickets and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate or our users ability to continue to use our tickets business regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations in many jurisdictions our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors which we must develop and maintain on acceptable terms for our tickets business to be successful our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries 17a portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the stubhub platform is processed by stubhub in digital form systems failures security breaches theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such sellers tickets inventory could result in significant costs and a loss of consumer confidence in our tickets business lawsuits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past and may in the future be filed against stubhub and ebay by venue owners competitors ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to change our business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources including ticketing service companies event organizers ticket brokers and online and offline ticket resellers some ticketing service companies event organizers and professional sports teams have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designed to restrict or prohibit the transferability and by extension the resale of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrict resale of season tickets to a preferred designated website ticketing service companies have also begun to use marketbased pricing strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices and impose additional restrictions on transferability for premium tickets some sports teams have threatened to revoke the privileges of season ticket owners if they resell their tickets through a platform that is not affiliated with or approved by such sports teamsthe listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners including pirated or counterfeit items may harm our businessthe listing or sale by our users of unlawful counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner has resulted and may continue to result in allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities against us including the employees and directors of our various entities involving activities carried out by users through our services in a number of circumstances third parties including government regulators and law enforcement officials have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws including laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability and by extension the resale of digital goods eg event tickets books music and software the fencing of stolen goods selective distribution channel laws customs laws distance selling laws antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets and the sale of items outside of the united states that are regulated by us export controls for examplein turkey local prosecutors and courts are investigating our liability for allegedly illegal actions by users of our turkish marketplace business gittigidiyor in accordance with local law and custom they have indicted one or more members of the board of directors of our local turkish subsidiary we intend to defend vigorously against any such actions and a growing number of these cases have been dismissed by the relevant courts in august 2012 we were informed that us listings of footwear with religious imagery were visible on our local indian site and we immediately removed these listings in september 2012 a criminal case was registered against us in india in regard to these listings and we are challenging the prosecution of this case in addition allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights including but not limited to counterfeit items have resulted in threatened and actual litigation from time to time by rights owners including the following luxury brand owners tiffany amp co in the united states rolex sa and coty prestige lancaster group gmbh in germany louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france and loréal sa lancôme parfums et beauté amp cie and laboratoire garnier amp cie in several european countries plaintiffs in these and similar suits seek among other remedies injunctive relief and damages statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to 150000 per copyright violation and 2000000 per trademark violation in the united states and may be even higher in other jurisdictions in the past we have paid substantial amounts in connection with resolving certain trademark and copyright suits these and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner that increases costs lowers revenue makes our websites and mobile platforms less convenient to customers and requires us to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices in addition we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods which could damage our reputation diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our products and services18we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our servicesonline services companies may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services including claims alleging defamation libel breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement among other things the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the united states and foreign jurisdictions any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business our potential liability to third parties for the userprovided content on our sites particularly in jurisdictions outside the united states where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled may increase if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings which could harm our business changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increase our costs and loss rateour ebay money back guarantee program represents the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded have not received the item that they purchased or have received an item different from what was described we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made our liability for these sort of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some nonus jurisdictions than it is in the united states litigation involving liability for any such thirdparty actions could be costly and time consuming for us divert management attention result in increased costs of doing business lead to adverse judgments or settlements or otherwise harm our business in addition affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us including imposing fines or seeking injunctionswe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we believe the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the united states and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct businesshowever effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available and contractual arrangements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could materially harm our businessas the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert managements time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay rollout or redesign our products or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have 19with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm our businessfailure to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our platforms would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our serviceswe face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on our platforms and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may not have received the goods that they had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase in some european and asian jurisdictions buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period while we can in some cases suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users we do not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through its buyer protection program which in the united states we refer to as the ebay money back guarantee although we have implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in combating fraudulent transactions or improving overall satisfaction among sellers buyers and other participants additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of our services to buyers or sellers resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users damage to our reputation or a diminution in the value of our brand nameswe have substantial indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to service our indebtedness failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquiditywe have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences including without limitation any of the following requiring us to use a significant portion of our cash flow from operations and other available cash to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes including capital expenditures and acquisitionsour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditionsadverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costsour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or other general corporate and other purposes may be limited andour flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry may be limitedour ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things repatriate funds to the united states at substantial tax costseek additional financing in the debt or equity marketsrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtednesssell selected assets orreduce or delay planned capital or operating expendituressuch measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all20our revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain and any debt instruments we enter into in the future may contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict among other things our business and operations if we fail to pay amounts due under or breach any of the covenants in a debt instrument then the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder subject in certain cases to grace or cure period moreover any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of any of our indebtedness could in turn constitute an event of default under other debt instruments thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial conditiona downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our businesssome of our outstanding indebtedness has received credit ratings from certain rating agencies such ratings are limited in scope and do not purport to address all risks relating to an investment in those debt securities but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating was issued the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and there can be no assurance that such ratings will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency or placed on a socalled watch list for a possible downgrade or assigned a negative ratings outlook if in any rating agencys judgment circumstances so warrant moreover these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our debt securities actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook would likely increase our borrowing costs which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and could harm our business our credit ratings were downgraded as a result of the distribution of 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal to our stockholders the distribution pursuant to which paypal became an independent company as of january 1 2014 our longterm debt and shortterm funding were rated investment grade by standard and poors financial services llc longterm rated a shortterm rated a1 with a stable outlook moodys investor service longterm rated a2 shortterm rated p1 with a stable outlook and fitch ratings inc longterm rated a shortterm rated f1 with a stable outlook all of these credit rating agencies lowered their ratings in

disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds our borrowing costs depend in part on our credit ratings and any further actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings as described above will likely increase our borrowing costs our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxesthe application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax vat goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or ecommerce in addition governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues including through indirect taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertainwe do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services however some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws that require remote sellers of goods and services to collect and remit taxes on sales to customers located within the jurisdiction in particular the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing multiyear effort by us state and local governments to pursue federal legislation that would require collection and remittance of sales tax by outofstate sellers could allow states that meet certain simplification and other criteria to require outofstate sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by instate residents the adoption of such legislation could result in a use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers this collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection remittance and audit requirements would make selling on our websites and mobile platforms less attractive for small business retailers and would harm our business and the proliferation of 21state legislation to expand sales and use tax collection on internet sales could adversely affect some of our sellers and indirectly harm our businessseveral proposals have been made at the us state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet these proposals if adopted could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities while the us federal governments moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been temporarily extended this moratorium does not prohibit federal state or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium andor one of its extensions from time to time some taxing authorities in the united states have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on our services these notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful in the future which would harm our businesssimilar issues exist outside of the united states where the application of vat or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is complex and evolving while we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due some of our subsidiaries have from time to time received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees we have been paying vat on fees charged to certain of our users in the european union based on the service providers location on january 1 2015 changes to the rules determining the place of supply and thus the country of taxation for all european union based providers of electronically supplied services were implemented that require that we pay vat based on the residence or normal place of business of our customers these changes may result in our paying a higher rate of vat on such fees additionally we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate in most cases we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries however because of our unique business model the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our businessin certain jurisdictions we collect and remit indirect taxes on our fees and pay taxes on our purchases of goods and services however tax authorities may raise questions about our calculation reporting and collection of taxes and may ask us to remit additional taxes as well as the proper calculation of such taxes should any new taxes become applicable or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient our business could be harmed a taxing authority may seek to impose a tax collection reporting or recordkeeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce for example the us internal revenue service irs now requires that certain payments to sellers be reported to the sellers and the irs on an annual basis any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business taxing authorities may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction regardless of where the respective users are located some jurisdictions could assert that we are responsible for tax on the underlying goods or services sold on our sites imposition of a record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business tax authorities may also require us to help ensure compliance by our users by promulgating legislation regulating professional sellers including tax reporting and collection requirements in addition we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce and any use of those records to investigate collect taxes from or prosecute sellers could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business22we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilitiesthe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world including with respect to our business structure any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could harm our business and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficientin addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by a shift in our jurisdictional earning mix by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in light of continuing fiscal challenges in certain us states and in many countries in europe various levels of government are increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue including corporate income taxes for example the economic downturn reduced tax revenues for united states federal and state governments and a number of proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities have been implemented or are being considered at various levels of government these include a number of proposals to modify the us federal income tax laws applicable to companies like ours operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions which if enacted could materially increase our effective tax rate a number of us states have attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state and taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions may take similar actions many us states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable income or loss attributable to their state from certain outofstate businesses similarly in europe and elsewhere in the world there are various tax reform efforts underway designed to ensure that corporate entities are taxed on a larger percentage of their earnings companies that operate over the internet such as ebay are a target of some of these efforts if more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to internet companies that do not have a physical presence in their respective jurisdictions this could increase our effective tax ratewe may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligationsone or more states the us federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several states and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if one of our companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates certain of our companies are required to report to the internal revenue service irs on customers subject to us income tax who receive more than 20000 in payments and more than 200 payments in a calendar year as a result we are required to request tax identification numbers from certain payees track payments by tax identification number and under certain conditions withhold a portion of payments and forward such withholding to the irs we have modified our systems to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our businessour business is subject to online security risks including security breaches and cyberattacksour businesses involve the storage and transmission of users personal financial information in addition a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us an increasing number of websites including those owned by several other large internet and offline companies have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target certain efforts may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resources and therefore may be even more difficult to detect as a result we 23may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities fraud trickery or other means of deceiving our employees contractors and temporary staff a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users personal information cause interruption or degradations in our operations damage our computers or those of our users or otherwise damage our reputation in addition our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate user names passwords payment card numbers or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our users computers our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similar effectsin may 2014 we publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data including user names encrypted user passwords and other nonfinancial user data upon making this announcement we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in order to log into their account the breach and subsequent password reset have negatively impacted the business in july 2014 a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the breach the lawsuit was recently dismissed with leave to amend in addition we have received requests for information and are subject to investigations regarding this incident from numerous regulatory and other government agencies across the worldwe may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to redress problems caused by breaches these issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of markets where we operate additionally our insurance policies carry low coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to fully collect if at all under these insurance policiessystems failures or cyberattacks and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites applications products or services could harm our business our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation due to of hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and other cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other events our systems are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities we have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our websites and mobile applications could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites and could permanently harm our reputation and brands moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities in particular a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays result in loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events24acquisitions dispositions joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties and could harm our business we have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope technologies services and products and have in july 2015 distributed 100 of the outstanding common stock of paypal to our stockholders pursuant to which paypal became an independent company and sold our enterprise business in november 2015 we also expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as strategic investments and joint venturesthese transactions may involve significant challenges and risks includingthe potential loss of key customers merchants vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire or dispose of following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plansdeclining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of which may result from changes in compensation or changes in management reporting relationships future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed businessdifficulty making new and strategic hires of new employeesdiversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to the transaction and in the case of an acquisition integration and administrationthe need to provide transition services to a disposed of company which may result in the diversion of resources and focusthe need to integrate the operations systems including accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems technologies products and personnel of each acquired company which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a resultthe need to implement or improve controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition may have lacked such controls procedures and policies or whose controls procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standardsrisks associated with our expansion into new international marketsderivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisition or dispositionliability for activities of the acquired or disposed of company before the transaction including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes violations of laws rules and regulations commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities and in the case of dispositions liabilities to the acquirors of those businesses under contractual provisions such as representations warranties and indemnitiesthe potential loss of key employees following the transactionthe acquisition of new customer and employee personal information by us or a third party acquiring assets or businesses from us which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure andour dependence on the acquired business accounting financial reporting operating metrics and similar systems controls and processes and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired businessat any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in addition it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders we have made certain investments including through joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest andor lack management and operational control the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or 25adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks any circumstances which may be out of our control that adversely affect the value of our investments or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments could harm our business or negatively impact our financial resultsour success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could harm our businessour future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including key engineering and product development personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley where our corporate headquarters are located and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any key person life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our businessproblems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our sellers could harm our businessa number of third parties provide services to us or to our sellers such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software storefronts that help our sellers list items and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform among others financial or regulatory issues labor issues eg strikes lockouts or work stoppages or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our sellers could harm our businessprice increases by or service terminations disruptions or interruptions at companies that provide services to us and our sellers and clients could also reduce the number of listings on our platforms or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions thereby harming our business some third parties who provide services to us or our sellers may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint in addition the us postal service which is facing ongoing fiscal challenges has instituted postal rate increases and announced that it is considering closing thousands of local post offices and ending saturday mail delivery while we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their shipping experience postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers offerings and postal service changes could require certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our sites thereby harming our business we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty providers including some customer support and product development functions which are critical to our operations if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily our operations could be disrupted which could result in user dissatisfaction and could harm our businessthere can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our sellers will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our sellers on acceptable terms including as a result of bankruptcy we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all 26our developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional riskswe provide thirdparty developers with access to application programming interfaces software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use with a particular focus on mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could harm our business the distribution may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits and may adversely affect our business we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the distribution and the distribution may in fact adversely affect our business as an independent publicly traded company we will be a smaller less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations separating the businesses may also eliminate or reduce synergies or economies of scale that existed prior to the distribution which could harm our business we could incur significant liability if the distribution is determined to be a taxable transactionwe have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code the opinion relies on certain facts assumptions representations and undertakings from paypal and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received the irs could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion if the distribution is determined to be taxable for us federal income tax purposes our shareholders that are subject to us federal income tax and we could incur significant us federal income tax liabilitieswe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the distributionwe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with paypal to govern the distribution and the relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and paypal the indemnity rights we have against paypal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us in addition our indemnity obligations to paypal may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our results of operations and financial conditionitem 1b unresolved staff commentsnot applicable 27item 2 properties we own and lease various properties in the us and 34 other countries around the world we use the properties for executive and administrative offices data centers product development offices fulfillment centers and customer service offices our headquarters are located in san jose california and occupy approximately 05 million square feet our owned data centers are primarily located in utah as of december 31 2016 our owned and leased properties provided us with aggregate square footage as follows in millions united states other countries totalowned facilities11  11leased facilities08 20 28total facilities19 20 39from time to time we consider various alternatives related to longterm facilities needs while we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs it may become necessary to develop and improve land that we own or lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth 28item 3 legal proceedings litigation and other legal mattersoverviewwe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements if only a range of estimated losses can be determined we accrue an amount within the range that in our judgment reflects the most likely outcome if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount we accrue the low end of the range for those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding ie monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement are not material if we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a proceeding we have disclosed that fact in assessing the materiality of a proceeding we evaluate among other factors the amount of monetary damages claimed as well as the potential impact of nonmonetary remedies sought by plaintiffs eg injunctive relief that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business with respect to the matters disclosed in this item 3 we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such nonmonetary remediesamounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended december 31 2016 except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this item 3 we have concluded based on currently available information that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings ie monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material however legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties if one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting period could be material litigationin march 2015 stubhub filed suit against ticketmaster and the golden state warriors alleging antitrust and various state law violations arising out of the defendants restrictive ticketing practices which include prohibiting the resale of warriors tickets on stubhub or any other nonticketmaster secondary exchange stubhub inc v golden state warriors llc et al nd cal no 315cv01436 stubhub filed a first amended complaint on june 30 2015 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint which was granted in november 2015 stubhub will no longer pursue appealing this decisionregulatory proceedings in may 2014 we publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate our network and steal certain data including user names encrypted user passwords and other nonfinancial user data upon making this announcement we required all buyers and sellers on our platform to reset their passwords in order to login to their account in addition to making this public announcement we proactively approached a number of regulatory and governmental bodies including those with the most direct supervisory authority over our data privacy and data security programs to specifically inform them of the incident and our actions to protect our customers in response certain of those regulatory agencies have requested us to provide further more detailed information regarding the incident and we believe that we have fully cooperated in all of those requests to date we have not been informed by any regulatory authority of an intention to bring any enforcement action arising from this incident however in the future we may be subject to fines or other regulatory action in addition in july 2014 a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the incident the lawsuit was dismissed with leave to amend29general mattersother third parties have from time to time claimed and others may claim in the future that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our business as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies andor against our customers who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our acquisitions and divestitures and in cases where we are entering new lines of business we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims we may also become more vulnerable to thirdparty claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand the scope of our business both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable we believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us intellectual property claims whether meritorious or not are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable termsfrom time to time we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business including suits by our users individually or as class actions alleging among other things improper disclosure of our prices rules or policies that our practices prices rules policies or customeruser agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly andor not acted in conformity with such prices rules policies or agreements further the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as we have grown larger our businesses have expanded in scope both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations and our products and services have increased in complexity any claims or regulatory actions against us whether meritorious or not could be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement require us to change our business practices in expensive ways require significant amounts of management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our businessindemnification provisionswe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with paypal to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and paypal which may be significant in addition the indemnity rights we have against paypal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to paypal may be significantin addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors executive officers and certain other officers these agreements require us to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with us in the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations including our standard marketing promotions and applicationprogramminginterface license agreements under these contracts we generally indemnify hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names trademarks logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement in certain cases we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision to date losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant either individually or collectivelyitem 4 mine safety disclosuresnot applicable30part ii item 5 market for registrants common equity related

transactional currency amounts the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements during 2016 was due to the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies primarily the british pound korean won canadian dollar and australian dollar fiscal year highlightsnet revenues increased 5 to 90 billion in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily driven by stubhub net transaction revenues and

the fourth quarter of 2016 we recognized a tax benefit of 46 billion as a result of the initial stages of realigning our legal structure and the associated tax rulings in addition we sold our equity

recognition in 2016 of deferred tax assets of approximately 46 billion as a result of the realignment of our legal structure and the associated tax agreements this was partially offset by the 485 million tax effect on the 13 billion gain on the sale of our equity holdings of mercadolibre inc our effective tax rate was 19 in 2015 compared to 134 in 2014 the decrease in our effective tax rate during 2015 compared to 2014 was due to the recognition in 2014 of deferred tax liabilities of approximately 30 billion of us income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on 90 billion of undistributed foreign earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries for 2013 and prior years this was partially offset by the tax effect of gains on sale of certain investments in 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2016 we began the process of realigning our legal structure subsequent to the distribution of paypal holdings inc to better reflect how we manage and operate our platforms we consider many factors in effecting this realignment including foreign exchange exposures longterm cash flows and cash needs of our platforms capital allocation considerations and the associated tax effects as a result of the initial stages of this realignment and the associated tax agreements we have achieved a substantial stepup in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign ebay platforms we recognized a tax benefit of 46 billion which represents the income tax effect of the stepup in tax basis in the future we expect the noncash tax impacts of the realignment in our foreign ebay platforms will significantly increase our income tax provision the realignment is expected to extend into 2018 and primarily impact our international entities in the first half of 2017 we may achieve a stepup in the tax basis of the intangible assets in our foreign classifieds platforms accordingly the noncash tax impacts of the realignment in our foreign classifieds platforms will impact our tax provision in a manner similar to the impact from our foreign ebay platformswe benefit from tax rulings concluded in several different jurisdictions most significantly switzerland and luxembourg the cash tax benefit of these rulings totaled approximately 307 million in 2016 319 million in 2015 and 339 million in 2014 we expect the ongoing realignment of our legal structure will result in the termination amendment or replacement of certain tax rulings however we expect to continue to benefit from tax rulings that lower our cash tax obligations in certain foreign jurisdictions in the future we expect these cash tax benefits to remain consistent subject to the performance of our foreign platformsour provision for income taxes differs from the provision computed by applying the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to lower tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in certain lowertax jurisdictions outside the us the impact on our provision for income taxes of foreign income being taxed at different rates than the us federal statutory rate was a benefit of approximately 346 million in 2016 399 million in 2015 and 432 million in 2014 the foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates that had the most significant impact on our provision for income taxes in the periods presented include switzerland and luxembourg we expect to continue to benefit from lower tax rates due to our continued operations in foreign jurisdictions in particular in switzerland see note 15  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our tax rate reconciliationour relative pretax earnings and revenues attributable to the us as compared to the rest of the world may differ over time for the year ended december 31 2016 our us share of pretax income and net revenues was 419 and 431 respectively for the year ended december 31 2015 our us share of pretax income and net revenues was 165 and 422 respectively for the year ended december 31 2014 our us share of pretax income and net revenues was 203 and 401 respectively the difference in relative pretax income and net revenues attributable to the us as compared to the rest of the world for both 2016 and 2015 was primarily related to larger stockbased 43compensation expense recorded in the us for us based employees overhead related to our corporate operations which are primarily us based and higher average margins earned by nonus businesses in addition the us pretax income for 2016 includes a 979 million gain on the sale of the us portion of our equity holdings of mercadolibre incour provision for income taxes is volatile and in general is adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates our provision for income taxes does not include provisions for us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes associated with 74 billion of undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries because we intend to reinvest those earnings indefinitely in our foreign subsidiaries if these earnings were distributed into the us in the form of dividends to ebay companies domiciled in the us or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred we would be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes additionally please see the information in item 1a risk factors under the caption we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilitiesfrom time to time we engage in certain intercompany transactions we consider many factors when evaluating these transactions these transactions may impact our tax rate andor result in additional cash tax payments the impact in any period may be significant these transactions are complex and the impact of such transactions on future periods may be difficult to estimatewe are regularly under examination by tax authorities both domestically and internationally we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations although we cannot assure you that this will be the case given the inherent uncertainties in these examinations due to the ongoing tax examinations we believe it is impractical to determine the amount and timing of these adjustmentsnongaap measure of financial performanceto supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we use fxneutral net revenues which are nongaap financial measures management uses the foregoing nongaap measures in reviewing our financial results we define fxneutral net revenues as net revenues minus the exchange rate effect we define exchange rate effect as the yearoveryear impact of foreign currency movements using prior period foreign currency rates applied to current year transactional currency amountsthese nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative to measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies in addition these nongaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles nongaap measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures these nongaap measures are provided to enhance investors overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future specifically we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding the foreign currency exchange rate impact that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook in addition because we have historically reported certain nongaap results to investors we believe that the inclusion of these nongaap measures provide consistency in our financial

june 2015 our board authorized an additional 1 billion stock repurchase program and in july 2016 our board authorized an additional 25 billion stock repurchase program these stock repurchase programs have no expiration from the date of authorization our stock repurchase programs are intended to programmatically offset the impact of dilution from our equity compensation programs and subject to market conditions and other factors to make opportunistic repurchases of our common stock to reduce our outstanding share count any share repurchases under our stock repurchase programs may be made through open market transactions block trades privately negotiated transactions including accelerated share repurchase transactions or other means at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate and will be funded from our working capital or other financing alternativesduring 2016 we repurchased approximately 30 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs as of december 31 2016 a total of approximately 13 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our july 2016 repurchase program and no amounts remained under our january 2015 and june 2015 repurchase programs we expect subject to market conditions and other uncertainties to continue making opportunistic repurchases of our common stock however our stock repurchase programs may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including corporate and regulatory requirements price and other market conditions and managements determination as to the appropriate use of our cash shelf registration statement and longterm debtas of december 31 2016 we had an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission that allows us to issue various types of debt securities as well as common stock preferred stock warrants depositary shares

table does not include 436 million of such noncurrent liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016 liquidity and capital resource requirementsas of december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 we had assets classified as cash and cash equivalents as well as shortterm and longterm nonequity investments in an aggregate amount of 110 billion and 85 billion respectively as of december 31 2016 this amount included assets held in certain of our foreign operations totaling approximately 82 billion of the 82 billion held by our nonus subsidiaries approximately 46 billion was available for use in the us without incurring additional us income taxes in excess of the amounts already accrued in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 we had not repatriated any of these funds to the us and as a result we have not yet paid us tax on any portion of these funds however to the extent we repatriate these funds to the us we will be required to pay us income and applicable foreign withholding taxes on those amounts during the period when such repatriation occurs the remaining amount of nonus cash and cash equivalents as well as shortterm and longterm nonequity investments have been indefinitely reinvested and therefore no us current or deferred taxes have been accrued as this amount is necessary to support our planned ongoing investments in our foreign operations we believe our us sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the us and we do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us under current tax laws should our plans change and we were to choose to repatriate some or all of the funds we have designated as indefinitely reinvested outside the us such amounts would be subject to us income taxes and applicable nonus income and withholding taxes in the fourth quarter of 2016 we sold our equity holdings of mercadolibre inc for net proceeds of 13 billion the pretax gain of 13 billion was recorded in interest and other net on our consolidated statement of income we actively monitor all counterparties that hold our cash and cash equivalents and nonequity investments focusing primarily on the safety of principal and secondarily on improving yield on these assets we diversify our cash and cash equivalents and investments among various counterparties in order to reduce our exposure should any one of these counterparties fail or encounter difficulties to date we have not experienced any material loss or lack of access to our invested cash cash equivalents or shortterm investments however we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash cash equivalents or shortterm investments will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets at any point in time we have funds in our operating accounts and customer accounts that are deposited and invested with third party financial institutionswe believe that our existing cash cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments together with cash expected to be generated from operations borrowings available under our credit agreement and commercial paper program and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operating activities anticipated capital expenditures and stock repurchases for the foreseeable future offbalance sheet arrangementsas of december 31 2016 we had no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources we have a cash pooling arrangement with a financial institution for cash management purposes this arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the same financial institution aggregate cash deposits this arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the aggregate cash deposits up to an agreedupon limit the net balance of the withdrawals and the aggregate cash deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under the arrangement as of december 31 2016 we had a total of 16 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our 16 billion in aggregate cash deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangement50indemnification provisionswe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with paypal to govern the separation and relationship of the two companies going forward these agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us and paypal which may be significant in addition the indemnity rights we have against paypal under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us and our indemnity obligations to paypal may be significantin addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors executive officers and certain other officers these agreements require us to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with us in the ordinary course of business we have included limited indemnification provisions in certain of our agreements with parties with which we have commercial relations including our standard marketing promotions and applicationprogramminginterface license agreements under these contracts we generally indemnify hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party in connection with claims by a third party with respect to our domain names trademarks logos and other branding elements to the extent that such marks are applicable to our performance under the subject agreement in certain cases we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement it is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions due to our limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular provision to date losses recorded in our consolidated statement of income in connection with our indemnification provisions have not been significant either individually or collectivelycritical accounting policies judgments and estimates general the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related notes requires us to make judgments estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources our senior management has discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements the following descriptions of critical accounting policies judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other disclosures included in this report revenue recognition we may enter into certain revenue transactions primarily related to certain advertising contracts that are considered multiple element arrangements arrangements with more than one deliverable we also may enter into arrangements to purchase goods andor services from certain customers as a result significant interpretation and judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for these transactions including 1 how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple deliverables 2 developing an estimate of the standalone selling price of each deliverable 3 whether revenue should be reported gross as ebay is acting as a principal or net as ebay is acting as an agent 4 when we provide cash consideration to our customers determining whether we are receiving an identifiable benefit that is separable from the customers purchase of our products andor services and for which we can reasonably estimate fair value and 5 whether the arrangement would be characterized as revenue or reimbursement of costs incurred changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the timing or amount of revenue recognition51income taxes our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions including evaluating uncertainties we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax laws and regulations our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the us indefinite reinvestment is determined by managements judgment about and intentions concerning our future operations as of december 31 2016 74 billion of earnings had been indefinitely reinvested outside the us primarily in active nonus business operations we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund us operations and accordingly we do not provide for us federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earningsdeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources including reversal of taxable temporary differences forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies these sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors including our historical experience and shortrange and longrange business forecasts as of december 31 2016 we had a valuation allowance on certain loss carryforwards based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us or gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return gaap further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalties if any related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash the following table illustrates our effective tax rates for 2016 2015 and 2014  year ended december 31 2016 2015 2014 in millions except percentagesprovision for income taxes3634 459 3380as a  of income before income taxes995 191 1344our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes or interpretations in tax laws regulations or accounting principles in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service as well as various state and foreign tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 52based on our results for the year ended december 31 2016 a onepercentage point change in our provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the provision of approximately 37 million resulting in an approximate 003 change in diluted earnings per share goodwill and intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between intangible assets and the net tangible assets of the acquired business with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill the determination of the value of the intangible assets acquired involves certain judgments and estimates these judgments can include but are not limited to the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital as of december 31 2016 our goodwill totaled 45 billion and our identifiable intangible assets net totaled 102 million we assess the impairment of goodwill of our reporting units annually or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment then the reporting units carrying value is compared to its fair value the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using market and discounted cash flow approaches goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value the discounted cash flow approach uses expected future operating results the market approach uses comparable company information to determine revenue and earnings multiples to value our reporting units failure to achieve these expected results or market multiples may cause a future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august 31 2016 and 2015 additionally we evaluated impairment based on the significant activities regarding the distribution and enterprise divestiture in 2015 see note 4  discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for further detail as of december 31 2016 we determined that no further impairment of the carrying value of goodwill for any reporting units was required see note 5  goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this report legal contingencies in connection with certain pending litigation and other claims we have estimated the range of probable loss net of expected recoveries and provided for such losses through charges to our consolidated statement of income these estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based upon new information and future events from time to time we are involved in disputes and regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business we are currently involved in legal proceedings some of which are discussed in item 1a risk factors item 3 legal proceedings and note 12  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements included in this report we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously however even if successful our defense against certain actions will be costly and could require significant amounts of managements time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources if the plaintiffs were to prevail on certain claims we might be forced to pay significant damages and licensing fees modify our business practices or even be prohibited from conducting a significant part of our business any such results could materially harm our business and could result in a material adverse impact on the financial position results of operations or cash flows recent accounting pronouncementssee note 1  the company

financial statements53item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investments and outstanding debt we seek to reduce earnings volatility that may result from changes in interest ratesas of december 31 2016 approximately 16 of our total cash and investments was held in cash and cash equivalents as such changes in interest rates will impact interest income as discussed below fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates  as of december 31 2016 the balance of our government bond and corporate debt securities was 92 billion which represented approximately 82 of our total cash and investments investments in both fixedrate and floatingrate interestearning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk the fair market value of our fixedrate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates in general fixedrate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interestrate risk than those with shorter maturities while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interestrate risk than fixedrate securities floatingrate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase due in part to these factors our investment income may fall short of expectations or we may suffer losses in principal if we sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial assets or liabilities as of december 31 2016 as of december 31 2016 we have 90 billion of outstanding senior notes of which 91 bore interest at fixed rates we entered into 24 billion of interest rate swap agreements that have the economic effect of modifying the fixed interest obligations associated with 115 billion of our 22 senior notes due july 2019 750 million of our 2875 senior notes due july 2021 and 500 million of our 3450 senior notes due july 2024 so that the interest payable on those notes effectively became variable based on libor plus a spread further changes in interest rates will impact interest expense on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility which bear interest at floating rates and the interest rate on any commercial paper borrowings we make and any debt securities we may issue in the future and accordingly will impact interest expense for additional details related to our debt please see note 11  debt to the consolidated financial statements included in this report investment riskthe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk to achieve this objective we maintain our cash equivalents and shortterm and longterm investments in a variety of asset types including bank deposits government bonds and corporate debt securitiesas of december 31 2016 our cost and equity method investments totaled 118 million which represented approximately 1 of our total cash and investments and were primarily related to equity method investments in privately held companies we review our investments for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in fair value of such assets below carrying value is otherthantemporary our analysis includes a review of recent operating results and trends recent salesacquisitions of the securities in which we have invested and other publicly available data foreign currency riskour commerce platforms operate globally resulting in certain revenues and costs that are denominated in foreign currencies primarily the euro british pound korean won and australian dollar subjecting us to foreign currency risk which may adversely impact our financial results we transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs in addition we charge our international subsidiaries for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate services we provide our cash flow results of operations and certain of our intercompany balances that are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations may differ materially from expectations and we may record significant gains or losses due to foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities54we have a foreign exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposures manage these exposures and reduce the potential effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated cash flows and results of operations through the purchase of foreign currency exchange contracts the effectiveness of the program and resulting usage of foreign exchange derivative contracts is at times limited by our ability to achieve cash flow hedge accounting subsequent to the distribution fewer of our currency flows meet the us gaap criteria for cash flow hedge accounting while economically we face the same currency risks our statement of income is more subject to volatility due to currency fluctuations these foreign currency exchange contracts are accounted for as derivative instruments for additional details related to our derivative instruments please see note 9  derivative instruments to our consolidated financial statements included in this report we use foreign exchange derivative contracts and invest nonus cash in us denominated investments to ultimately protect our forecasted us dollarequivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates these hedging contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements most of these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes for qualifying cash flow hedges the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts if any is recorded immediately in earnings for contracts not designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes the derivatives gain or loss is recognized immediately in earnings in our consolidated statement of income however only certain revenue and costs are eligible for cash flow hedge accounting certain of our foreign subsidiaries hold us denominated marketable securities the us dollareuro is the primary foreign exchange exposure for these nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securities these marketable securities are classified as availableforsale and as such fluctuations in the foreign exchange are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within the consolidated balance sheet these fluctuations are subsequently reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other net in the period in which the marketable securities are sold the realized foreign exchange gains and losses on these securities offset a portion of the foreign exchange fluctuations in earnings for the company the following table illustrates the fair values of outstanding foreign exchange

exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges and nonfunctional currency denominated marketable securitiessince our risk management programs are highly effective the potential loss in value described above would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposurein addition we use foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries these contracts reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities the foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other net which are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign exchange contractswe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20 for all currencies could be experienced in the near term these changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately 10 million as of 55december 31 2016 taking into consideration the
