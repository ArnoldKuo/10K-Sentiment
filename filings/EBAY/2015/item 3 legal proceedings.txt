factorsthe following discussion is divided into two sections the first section which begins immediately following this paragraph discusses some of the risks that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition the second section captioned risk factors related to the planned separation discusses some of the risks relating to our plan to separate paypal into an independent publicly traded company you should carefully review both of these sections as well as our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other information appearing in this report for important information regarding risks that affect usrisk factors that may affect our business results of operations and financial condition our operating and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as well as the trading price of our common stock and debt securities our operating and financial results have varied on a quarterly basis during our operating history and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors including as a result of the risks set forth in this risk factors section it is difficult for us to forecast the level or source of our revenues or earnings loss accurately in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business periodtoperiod comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely upon them as an indication of future performance we do not have backlog and substantially all of our net revenues each quarter come from transactions involving sales or payments during that quarter due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting revenues it is also difficult to forecast expenses as a percentage of net revenues quarterly and annual expenses as a percentage of net revenues reflected in our consolidated financial statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors the trading price of our common stock and debt securities could decline perhaps substantially as a result of the factors described in this paragraphsubstantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the ecommerce and global payments industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operationsmarketplacesour marketplaces businesses currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants the internet and mobile networks provide new rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services marketplaces compete in twosided markets and must attract both buyers and sellers to use our platforms consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through marketplaces have more and more alternatives and merchants have more channels to reach consumers we expect competition to continue to intensify online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other and our competitors include a number of online and offline retailers with significant resources and wellestablished brands moreover the barriers to entry into these channels can be low and businesses easily can launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommerce companies as we respond to changes in the competitive environment it may from time to time make pricing service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among sellers which could reduce activity on our websites and harm its profitabilityour marketplaces businesses face increased competitive pressure online and offline in particular the competitive norm for and the expected level of service from ecommerce and mobile commerce has significantly increased due to among other factors improved user experience greater ease of buying goods lower or no shipping costs faster shipping times and more favorable return policies also certain platform businesses such as alibaba apple google and facebook many of whom are larger than us or have greater capitalization have a dominant and secure position in other industries or certain significant markets and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer if we are unable to change our products offerings and services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the ecommerce and mobile commerce marketplaces particularly the higher growth of sales of fixedprice items and higher expected service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms or compete effectively with and adapt to changes in larger platform businesses our business will suffercompetitors with other revenue sources may also be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can other competitors may offer or continue to offer faster andor free shipping delivery on 13sunday sameday delivery favorable return policies or other transactionrelated services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match competitors may be able to innovate faster and more efficiently and new technologies may increase the competitive pressures by enabling competitors to offer more efficient or lowercost servicessome of our competitors control other products and services that are important to our success including credit card interchange internet search and mobile operating systems such competitors could manipulate pricing availability terms or operation of service related to their products and services in a manner that impacts our competitive offerings for example google which operates a shopping platform service made changes to its search algorithms that reduced the amount of search traffic directed to marketplaces from searches on google if we are unable to use or adapt to operational changes in such services we may face higher costs for such services or face integration or technological barriers it could raise our costs and our business will suffer consumers who might use our marketplaces sites to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives including traditional department warehouse boutique discount and general merchandise stores as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers online retailers and their related mobile offerings online and offline classified services and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks in the united states these include amazoncom which recently opened an experimental brickandmortar store in new york city and continues to expand into new geographies and lines of business google walmart target sears macys jc penney costco office depot staples officemax sams club buycom owned by rakuten yahoo shopping msn qvc and home shopping network among others in addition consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories of products offered on our siteconsumers also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake oodlecom and a number of international websites operated by schibsted asa or naspers limited consumers also can turn to shoppingcomparison sites such as google shopping in certain markets our fixedprice listing and traditional auctionstyle listing formats increasingly are being challenged by other formats such as classifiedsour classifieds websites offer classifieds listings in the united states and a variety of local international markets in many markets in which they operate including in the united states these classifieds platforms compete for customers and for advertisers against more established online and offline classifieds platformsour online shopping comparison websites shoppingcom compete with sites such as google shopping buycom nextagcom pricegrabbercom shopzilla buscapé in latin america owned by naspers and yahoo product search which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products in addition sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels including the acquisition of new customers by paying for searchrelated advertisements on horizontal search engine sites such as google yahoo naver and baidu we use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations consumers may choose to search for products and services with a horizontal search engine or shopping comparison website and such sites may also send users to other shopping destinationsconsumers and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives including general online ecommerce sites such as amazon and alibaba and more specialized sites such as etsy our international sites also compete for sellers with general and specialized online ecommerce sites sellers may also choose to sell their goods through other channels such as classifieds sites consumers and merchants also can create and sell through their own sites and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services in some countries there are online sites that have larger customer bases and greater brand recognition as well as competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce we increasingly may compete with local competitors in developing countries that have unique advantages such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authoritiesin addition certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels such as our marketplaces sites manufacturers may attempt to use contractual obligations or existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit ecommerce in certain categories of goods or services manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the internet generally or at prices that would make us less attractive relative to other alternatives the adoption by manufacturers of policies or their use of laws or regulations in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services over the internet could force our users to stop selling certain products on our websites which could result in reduced 14operating margins loss of market share and diminished value of our brands the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following  ability to attract retain and engage buyers and sellers and user engagementvolume of transactions and price and selection of goodstrust in the seller and the transactioncustomer service brand recognition community cohesion interaction and sizewebsite mobile platform and application easeofuse and accessibilitysystem reliabilityreliability of delivery and payment including customer preference for fast delivery and free shipping and returnslevel of service fees andquality of search toolswe may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we dopaymentsthe global payments industry is highly competitive we compete against businesses in varied industries many of whom are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position in other industries and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer as online and offline commerce increasingly converge the pace of change innovation and disruption is increasing the payments industry is rapidly changing highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny which may negatively affect the competitive landscape our payment programs compete against all forms of payment includingpaperbased transactions principally cash and checksproviders of traditional payment methods particularly credit and debit cards money orders and automated clearing house transactions these providers are primarily wellestablished banksproviders of digital wallets which offer customers the ability to pay online andor on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods including with mobile applications through contactless payments and with a variety of payment methods these providers include visa mastercard

providerservices such as coinbase and bitpay that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies such as bitcoin andcashmany of these payment providers have greater customer bases volume scale and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantages some of these competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements than paypal they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services than paypal and they may offer lower prices or more effectively introduce their own innovative programs and services that adversely impact paypals growth we also expect new entrants to offer competitive products and services in addition some merchants provide such services to themselves competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal in addition in certain countries such as germany netherlands and australia electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions as in the united states established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a servicepaypal competes primarily on the basis of the followingability to attract retain and engage both buyers and sellers with relatively low marketing expenseability to show that sellers will achieve incremental sales by offering paypalsecurity of transactions and the ability for buyers to use paypal without sharing their financial information with the sellerlow fees and simplicity of fee structureability to develop services across multiple commerce channels including mobile payments and payments at the retail point of saletrust in paypals dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programscustomer service brand recognitionwebsite mobile platform and application onboarding easeofuse and accessibilitysystem reliability and data security ease and quality of integration into thirdparty mobile applications and quality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kitsif paypal is not able to differentiate itself from its competitors drive value for its customers andor effectively align its resources with its goals and objectives paypal may not be able to compete effectively against these threats paypals failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threats could materially and adversely affect our overall business and results of operationsenterpriseour enterprise business provides a modular integrated portfolio of commerce technology solutions and services omnichannel operations solutions and commerce marketing solutions that enable companies to operate and integrate their ecommerce offering and their omnichannel business including physical stores in order to sell to consumers across the entire sales journey from awareness to conversion delivery and retention the market for such products and services is continuously 16evolving and intensely competitive many of our enterprise businesss prospective clients may choose to manage all or some aspects of an omnichannel business with internal resources as a result the enterprise business often competes with inhouse solutions promoted and supported by internal information technology staffs marketing departments merchandising groups and other internal corporate constituencies as well as with external technology and interactive marketing service providers that supply one or more components that allow prospective clients to develop and operate their omnichannel business inhouse this group of providers may include the prospective client itself and companies that offer one or more of the following web platforms customer carecall center services fulfillment and logistics systems integration services and technology products and services email management and data aggregation online marketing and design services and other interactive marketing services low barriers to entry in the interactive marketing industry could also increase the number of competitors we may faceour enterprise business competes primarily on the basis of the following offering a modular integrated portfolio of commerce technology solutions and services that are delivered on an individual basis or as bundled solutionsproviding a licensed open core platform offering an enterpriseclass native feature set and flexibility through direct source code access and apis that supports onpremise hosted managed via partners and ondemand cloud deployments via partnerspromoting the clients brand and business rather than our ownproviding enterpriselevel scale and operating leverageestablishing a commitment to

marketing solutions platform which we believe provides a more strategic cohesive and optimized approach to demand generation andproviding services that utilize proprietary technology to promote stronger customer engagement designed to increase clients return on investmentthe enterprise business has competitors with longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and greater financial marketing and other resources those competitors may be able to secure components of their technology and services on more favorable terms and devote more resources to technology development and marketing than the enterprise business in addition to the extent that we expand our enterprise business internationally it will face increased competition from global and local companies which may have a greater understanding of and focus on the local customerglobal and regional economic conditions could materially affect our businessour operations and performance depend significantly on global and regional economic conditions adverse economic conditions and events including volatility or distress in the equity andor debt or credit markets have in the past negatively impacted regional and global financial markets and will likely continue to do so from time to time in the future these events and conditions could have a negative and adverse impact on companies and customers with which we do business in addition financial turmoil affecting the banking system or financial markets could cause additional consolidation of the financial services industry or significant financial service institution failures new or incremental tightening in the credit markets low liquidity and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets adverse impacts to the companies and customers with which we do business the banking system or financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our business including a reduction in the volume and prices of transactions on our commerce and payments platformswe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange ratesbecause we generate the majority of our revenues outside the united states but report our financial results in us dollars our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or foreign exchange rates the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars for financial reporting purposes if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in increased us dollar denominated revenues and expenses similarly if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies particularly the euro british pound korean won australian dollar or canadian dollar our translation of foreign currency denominated revenues or expenses will result in lower us dollar denominated net revenues and expenses for the year ended december 31 2014 foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar positively impacted net revenues by approximately 30 million inclusive of a 36 million negative impact from hedging activities relating to paypals net revenue in addition to this translation effect a strengthening us dollar will typically adversely affect the volume of goods being sold by us sellers to europe australia and canada more than it positively affects the volume of goods being sold by sellers in 17those geographies to buyers in the united states thereby further negatively impacting our financial results additionally in connection with its services in multiple currencies paypal sets its foreign exchange rates twice per day and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly sets its foreign exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the times that paypal sets its foreign exchange rates given that paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies its financial results are affected by the translation of these nonus currencies into us dollarswhile from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results which may have a significant impact on the trading price of our common stock and debt securitieswe are exposed to fluctuations in interest ratesinvestments in both fixedrate and floatingrate interestearning instruments carry varying degrees of interest rate risk the fair market value of our fixedrate investment securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates in general fixedrate securities with longer maturities are subject to greater interestrate risk than those with shorter maturities while floating rate securities generally are subject to less interestrate risk than fixedrate securities floatingrate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates decrease and may also suffer a decline in market value if interest rates increase due in part to these factors our investment income may decline or we may suffer losses in principal if securities are sold that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2014 the balance of our government bond and corporate debt security portfolio was 81 billion which represented approximately 51 of our total cash and investment portfolio as of december 31 2014 our government bond and corporate debt security portfolio earned an average pretax yield of approximately 121 with a weighted average maturity of 22 months if interest rates as of december 31 2014 were 100 basis points higher lower the fair market value of our total fixedincome investment portfolio as of december 31 2014 could have decreased increased by approximately 103 million in addition relatively low interest rates limit our investment income including income we earn on paypal customer balances fluctuations in interest rates that increase the cost of our current or future indebtedness cause the market value of our assets to decline or reduce our investment income could adversely affect our financial resultsour international operations are subject to increased risks which may harm our business operating results and financial conditionour international businesses especially in germany the united kingdom australia and korea have generated a majority of our net revenues in recent years in addition to uncertainty about our ability to generate revenues from our foreign operations and expand into international markets there are risks inherent in doing business internationally includingexpenses associated with localizing our products and services and customer data including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences eg payment methods with which we may have limited or no experiencetrade barriers and changes in trade regulationsdifficulties in developing staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of varying foreign operations as a result of distance

developments and consequenceseconomic uncertainties relating to sovereign and other debtdifferent uncertain or more stringent user protection data protection privacy and other laws risks related to other government regulation or required compliance with local lawsnational or regional differences in macroeconomic growth rateslocal licensing and reporting obligations and18increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable violations of the complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations may result in fines criminal actions or sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies these risks inherent in our international operations and expansion increase our costs of doing business internationally and may result in harm to our business operating results and financial condition any factors that reduce crossborder trade or make it more difficult could harm our businesscrossborder trade is an important source of both revenue and profits for us crossborder transactions generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market crossborder trade also represents our primary or in some cases only presence in certain important markets such as brazillatin america china and various other countries in addition our crossborder trade is also subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations the interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products selective distribution networks and sellers in other countries listing items on the internet and the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the buyer the seller andor the location of the item being sold are often extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade the interpretation andor application of such laws could impose restrictions on or increase the costs of purchasing selling shipping or returning goods across national borders the shipping of goods across national borders is often more expensive and complicated than domestic shipping customs and duty procedures and reviews including dutyfree thresholds in various key markets the interaction of national postal systems and security related governmental processes at international borders may increase costs discourage crossborder purchases delay transit and create shipping uncertainties any factors that increase the costs of crossborder trade or restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenues and profits and adversely affect our business our business may be adversely affected by geopolitical events natural disasters seasonal factors and other factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications including increased usage of other websitesour users may spend less time on our websites and our applications for mobile devices as a result of a variety of diversions including geopolitical events such as war the threat of war or terrorist activity natural disasters power shortages or outages major public health issues including pandemics social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile applications significant local national or global events capturing the attention of a large part of the population and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors if any of these or any other factors divert our users from using of our websites or mobile applications our business could be materially adversely affected our success depends to a large degree on our ability to successfully address the rapidly evolving market for transactions on mobile devicesmobile devices are increasingly used for ecommerce transactions and payments a significant and growing portion of our users access our platforms through mobile devices we may lose users if we are not able to continue to meet our users mobile and multiscreen experience expectations in addition while we focus on ios and apps to enable users to access our platforms through mobile devices android is the leading mobile platform in europe and android users rely more on mobile web than apps the variety of technical and other configurations across different mobile devices and platforms increases the challenges associated with this environment in addition a number of other companies with significant resources and a number of innovative startups have introduced products and services focusing on mobile marketsour ability to successfully address the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving market for mobile transactions is crucial to our continued success and any failure to continuously increase the volume of mobile transactions effected through our platforms could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and business19if we cannot keep pace with rapid technological developments to provide new and innovative programs products and services the use of our products and our revenues could declinerapid significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate while rapidly changing technology affects all of our business segments the challenges faced by our payments segment are particularly significant and include developments in smart cards tokenization ecommerce mobile and radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless payments we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business in addition to our own initiatives and innovations we rely in part on third parties including some of our competitors for the development of and access to new technologies we expect that new services and technologies applicable to the industries in which we operate will continue to emerge these new services and technologies may be superior to or render obsolete the technologies we currently use in our products and services incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful in addition our ability to adopt new services and technologies that we develop may be inhibited by industrywide standards payments networks new laws and regulations resistance to change from clients or merchants or third parties intellectual property rights our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standardsour business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversightwe are subject to laws and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations in a number of areas including consumer protection data privacy requirements intellectual property ownership and infringement prohibited items and stolen goods resale of event tickets tax anticompetition export requirements anticorruption labor advertising digital content real estate billing ecommerce promotions quality of services telecommunications mobile communications and media environmental and health and safety regulations as well as laws and regulations intended to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorist activitiescompliance with these laws regulations and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business any such costs which may rise in the future as a result of changes in these laws and regulations or in their interpretation could individually or in the aggregate make our products and services less attractive to our customers delay the introduction of new products or services in one or more regions or cause us to change or limit our business practices we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations but there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures paypal is subject to additional government regulation and supervision relating to the provision of financial servicespaypal is subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and other countries where it operates such laws and regulations include those governing banking deposit taking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange and payment services such as payment processing and settlement services the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to paypal vary in the markets where paypal operates and have increased over time as the geographical scope and complexity of paypals business and products have expanded while paypal has a compliance program focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and has increased the resources allocated to that program in the last several years there can be no assurance that paypal will not be subject to fines or other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions or be required to make changes to its business practices or compliance programs in the future noncompliance could also result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions costs associated with fines enforcement actions as well as reputational harm changes in compliance requirements or limits on paypals ability to grow its business could adversely affect our financial resultspaypal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in the united states in the states where it is required and the district of columbia the us virgin islands and puerto rico paypals subsidiary venmo is also licensed as a money transmitter in certain us states as licensed money transmitters paypal and venmo are subject to restrictions on their investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies accordingly paypal and venmo could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change their business practices or be required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose substantial cost if they violate these laws or regulationswhile paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 200 markets paypal allows customers in only approximately half of those markets including the united states to also receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may affect paypals 20ability to grow in these markets of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service approximately 30 markets are in member states of the european union paypal provides localized versions of its service to customers in the european union through paypal europe sà rl et cie sca paypal europe a whollyowned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoneylaundering capitalization funds management corporate governance privacy information security bank secrecy taxation sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks any fines or other enforcement actions could adversely affect paypals business in addition european union laws and regulations are typically subject to different and potentially inconsistent interpretations by the countries that are members of the european union which can make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage moreover new laws and regulations affecting payments services providers may be adopted and existing laws and regulations may be subject to ongoing revision and interpretation all of which may increase compliance costs and be operationally difficult to manage paypal is also subject to regulation in other markets in which it does business and paypal has been and expects to continue to be required to apply for various licenses certifications and regulatory approvals in a number of the countries where it has operations in some countries it may not be clear whether paypal is required to be licensed as a bank financial institution or otherwise in such markets paypal may rely on partnerships with local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency local regulators may use their power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through paypals local banking partner such regulatory actions or the need to obtain licenses certifications or other regulatory approvals could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of paypal services in a given market or could require significant and costly operational changes or prevent paypal from providing any services in a given market paypal is subject to consumer protection laws and regulationspaypal is subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which it operates paypal is focused on compliance with these laws and regulations and has programs designed to comply with new and existing consumer protection requirements however any errors failures or delays in complying with such consumer protection laws and regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions as well as reputational harm any new consumer protection laws and regulations or changes to or expansion of the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations applicable to paypal could subject paypal to additional restrictions on its operations additional compliance and licensure requirements and increased regulatory scrutiny which could force paypal to change its business practices or limit its ability to grow its business costs associated with fines or enforcement actions changes in its compliance requirements or limitations on its ability to grow our business could have an adverse effect on its financial results and harm paypalalthough there have been no definitive interpretations to date paypal has taken actions as though its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e issued by the consumer financial protection bureau or cfpb under such regulations among other things paypal is required to provide advance disclosure of changes to its service to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account additionally even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to 1000 for each noncompliant transaction or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and we could also be liable for plaintiffs attorneys fees in the second quarter of 2010 two putative classaction lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v paypal inc and moises zepeda v paypal inc were filed in the us district court for the northern district of california these lawsuits contain allegations related to violations of aspects of the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e and violations of a previous settlement agreement related to regulation e andor allege that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited users accounts these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypals practices among other remedies a determination that there have been violations of the electronic fund transfer act regulation e or violations of other laws relating to paypals practices could expose paypal to significant liability any changes to paypals practices resulting from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend substantial resources which could delay other planned product launches or improvements and further harm our businessthe financial services sector has been increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny in january 2012 the cfpb finalized rules under regulation e mandated by the doddfrank act which required paypal beginning in october 2013 to provide additional disclosures error resolution rights and cancellation rights to us consumers who make international remittance payments in november 2014 the cfpb proposed a new prepaid account rule that would apply to prepaid cards and mobile wallets including paypal accounts in december 2014 paypal became subject to cfpb supervision and examination pursuant to a new regulation that allows the cfpb to supervise all companies including paypal that provide more than one million 21international money transfers per year under the proposal cfpb examiners are now able to examine paypal for compliance with the remittance transfer rule and other laws and regulations paypal europe implements its localized services in european union countries through a passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other european union member states pursuant to european union directives and has completed the passport notification process in all european union member countries other than croatia the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay paypals plans for expanding its business in european union countries in addition the countries that are members of the eu may each have different and potentially inconsistent interpretations of regulations implementing the european union payment services directive which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the european commission has proposed revisions to the payments services and antimoney laundering directives which could further make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage finally if the assets of paypal europe exceed certain thresholds paypal europe could become regulated by the european central bank rather than luxembourg which would likely increase its costspaypal is subject to antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulationspaypal is subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities paypal has programs designed to comply with new and existing legal and regulatory requirements however any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign antimoney laundering or counterterrorist financing laws and regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions as well as reputational harm for a discussion of paypals dealings with ofac please see item 3 legal proceedings  regulatory proceedings us regulators have increased their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations which may require paypal to further revise or expand its compliance program including the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international and domestic transactions several countries in which paypal is regulated have also implemented new antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and paypal has had to make changes to its compliance program in response regulators regularly reexamine the transaction volume thresholds at which paypal must obtain and keep applicable records or verify identities of customers and any change in such thresholds could result in greater costs for compliance costs associated with fines or enforcement actions changes in compliance requirements or limitations on our ability to grow our business could have an adverse effect on our financial results and any new requirements or changes to existing requirements could impose significant costs on paypal result in delays to planned product improvements make it more difficult for new customers to join paypals network and reduce the attractiveness of its productsregulation in the areas of consumer privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business we are subject to laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users around the world much of the personal information that we collect especially financial information is regulated by multiple laws user data protection laws may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations these laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and that may adversely impact our businessregulatory scrutiny of privacy user data protection use of data and data collection is increasing on a global basis we are subject to a number of privacy and similar laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate and these laws and regulations will likely continue to evolve over time both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and violations of privacyrelated laws can result in significant penalties a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to our practices under communicationsbased laws could expose us to significant damage awards fines and other penalties that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business in particular because of the enormous number of texts emails and other communications we send to our users communications laws that provide a specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation such as those described below could result in particularly large awards or fines22for example the federal communications commission amended certain of its regulations under the telephone consumer protection act or tcpa in 2012 and 2013 in a manner that could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones under the tcpa plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations we are regularly subject to classaction lawsuits as well as individual lawsuits containing allegations that our businesses violated the tcpa for example we recently settled murray v bill me later filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois in june 2012 which alleged that bill me later made calls featuring artificial or prerecorded voices without prior consent these lawsuits and other private lawsuits not currently alleged as class actions seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the enormous number of communications we send to our users a determination that there have been violations of the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our businesswe post on our websites our privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal state or international privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others eg class action privacy litigation subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase our costs and adversely affect our business data collection privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern if internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites mobile platforms products and services as a result of these concerns our business could be harmed as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these lawsnew and existing laws and regulations could harm our businessit is not always clear how laws and regulations governing matters relevant to our business such as property ownership copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property issues parallel imports and distribution controls consumer protection taxation libel and defamation obscenity and personal privacy apply to our businesses many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet mobile and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies many of these laws including some of those that do reference the internet are subject to interpretation by the courts on an ongoing basis and as a result their applicability and scope remain uncertain as our activities the products and services we offer and our geographical scope continue to expand regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to additional requirements including licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction either generally or with respect to certain actions financial and political events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our businesses our success and increased visibility have driven some existing businesses that perceive us to be a threat to their businesses to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators these businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services for example these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing parallel imports professional seller obligations selective distribution networks stolen goods copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues any changes to the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for thirdparty listings could negatively impact our businessnumerous us states and foreign jurisdictions including the state of california have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon us or our users and others may attempt to do so in the future attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing and we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues such as forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations we could also be subject to fines or other penalties and any of these outcomes could harm our businessa number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws for example trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a 23branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holders consent the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations our business could be harmedas we expand and localize our international activities we are increasingly becoming obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users or the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction for example we were found liable in france under french law for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers or sellers laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the united states are generally less favorable to us than those in the united states compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business in addition we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us eg in crossborder trade our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actionsfollowing the global financial crisis of 2008 us federal lawmakers enacted the doddfrank act overhauling the federal governments oversight of consumer financial products and systemic risk in the us financial system the general effect of the financial reform law has been and we expect will continue to be to require paypal to make additional disclosures to its users and to impose new restrictions and requirements on certain of its activities resulting in new compliance requirements and obligations that could increase our costs may result in increased litigation and the need to make expensive product changes and may otherwise adversely impact our businessin addition we also expect that the continued implementation of the doddfrank act will adversely impact some significant traditional revenue streams for banks for example in june 2011 the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees as a result of this and other regulations implementing the financial reform law banks may increase the service fees required for paypal to process transactions eg service fees for automated clearing house transactions which would increase our costs and could adversely affect our businesswe are regularly subject to general litigation regulatory disputes and government inquirieswe are regularly subject to claims lawsuits including class actions and individual lawsuits government investigations and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust intellectual property privacy consumer protection accessibility claims securities tax labor and employment commercial disputes content generated by our users services and other matters in particular our businesses face ongoing intellectual property litigation as further discussed below the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as our company has grown larger our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach and our products and services have increased in complexity in addition some of the laws and regulations affecting internet and mobile commerce and consumer credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the courts and governmental authorities and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these laws and regulations increases the risk that we will be subject to private claims and governmental actions alleging violations of those laws and regulationsthe outcome and impact of such claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigations and proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs diversion of management resources and other factors determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex factintensive process that is subject to judgment calls it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments fines or penalties or to settle claims or proceedings any of which could materially adversely affect our business financial position results of operations or cash flows these proceedings could also result in reputational harm criminal sanctions consent decrees or orders preventing us from offering certain products or services or requiring a change in our business practices in costly ways or requiring development of noninfringing or otherwise altered products or technologies any of these consequences could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition lawswe are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign laws and regulations including competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions 24violate the antitrust or competition laws of the united states individual states the european commission or other countries or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of governments are regulating competition law activities including increased scrutiny in large markets such as china our business partnerships or agreements or arrangements with customers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the united states may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive certain competition authorities have conducted market studies of our industries such claims and investigations even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practiceswe are subject to patent litigationwe have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents we are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims because among other reasonsour products and services continue to expand in scope and complexitywe continue to expand into new businesses including through acquisitions andthe universe of patent owners who may claim that we any of the companies that we have acquired or our customers infringe their patents and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners continues to increasesuch claims may be brought directly against us andor against our customers whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so as a business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries patent claims whether meritorious or not are timeconsuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements make substantial payments to satisfy adverse judgments or settle claims or proceedings or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our businessour tickets business is subject to regulatory competitive and other risks that could harm this businessour tickets business which includes our stubhub business is subject to numerous risks including some jurisdictions in particular jurisdictions outside the united states prohibit the resale of event tickets antiscalping laws at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all or highly regulate the resale of tickets and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions could limit or inhibit our ability to operate or our users ability to continue to use our tickets business regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations in many jurisdictions our tickets business depends on commercial partnerships with event organizers or licensed ticket vendors which we must develop and maintain on acceptable terms for our tickets business to be successful our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries a portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the stubhub website is processed by stubhub in digital form systems failures security breaches theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such sellers tickets inventory could result in significant costs and a loss of consumer confidence in our tickets business lawsuits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past and may in the future be filed against stubhub and ebay by venue owners competitors ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers such lawsuits could result in significant costs and require us to change our business practices in ways that negatively affect our tickets business our tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources including ticketing service companies event organizers ticket brokers and online and offline ticket resellers some ticketing service companies event organizers and professional sports teams have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designed to restrict or prohibit the transferability and by extension the resale of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale or restrict resale of season tickets to a preferred designated website ticketing service companies have also begun to use marketbased pricing strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices and impose additional restrictions on transferability for premium tickets 25the listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners including pirated or counterfeit items may harm its businessthe listing or sale by our users of unlawful counterfeit or stolen goods or unlawful services or sale of goods or services in an unlawful manner has resulted and may continue to result in allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities against us including the employees and directors of our various entities involving activities carried out by users through our services in a number of circumstances third parties including government regulators and law enforcement officials have alleged that our services aid and abet violations of certain laws including laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability and by extension the resale of digital goods eg event tickets books music and software the fencing of stolen goods selective distribution channel laws customs laws distance selling laws antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets and the sale of items outside of the united states that are regulated by us export controls for examplein turkey local prosecutors and courts are investigating our liability for allegedly illegal actions by users of our turkish marketplaces business gittigidiyor in accordance with local law and custom they have indicted one or more members of the board of directors of our local turkish subsidiary we intend to defend vigorously against any such actions and a growing number of these cases have been dismissed by the relevant courts in august 2012 we were informed that us listings of footwear with religious imagery were visible on our local indian site and we immediately removed these listings in september 2012 a criminal case was registered against us in india in regard to these listings and we are challenging the prosecution of this case in addition allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights including but not limited to counterfeit items have resulted in threatened and actual litigation from time to time by rights owners including the following luxury brand owners tiffany amp co in the united states rolex sa and coty prestige lancaster group gmbh in germany louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france and loréal sa lancôme parfums et beauté amp cie and laboratoire garnier amp cie in several european countries plaintiffs in these and similar suits seek among other remedies injunctive relief and damages statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to 150000 per copyright violation and 2000000 per trademark violation in the united states and may be even higher in other jurisdictions in the past we have paid substantial amounts in connection with resolving certain trademark and copyright suits these and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices in a manner that increases costs lowers revenue makes our websites and mobile platforms less convenient to customers and requires us to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in order to combat these practices in addition we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal or counterfeit goods which could damage our reputation diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our products and servicesuse of our payments services for illegal purposes could harm our businesspaypals payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods money laundering terrorist financing bank fraud child pornography trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products online securities fraud and encouraging promoting facilitating or instructing others to engage in illegal activities there has been an increased focus by intellectual property rights owners and government officials on the role that payments systems play in the sale of and payment for pirated digital goods on the internet primarily through file sharing services changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional paymentsrelated proposals are under active consideration by government authorities intellectual property rights owners may seek to bring legal action against payment companies such as paypal and other entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items rights owners have also increasingly gone into us courts and obtained injunctions requiring paypal to cease handling transactions for named websites and third parties in most cases located outside the united states and to hold the funds of such parties pending judicial resolution of the rights owners claims which disrupts the relationship between paypal and such parties any resulting claims could damage our reputation and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business and our financial resultswe are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our servicesonline services companies may be subject to claims relating to information disseminated through their services including claims alleging defamation libel breach of contract invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement 26among other things the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information disseminated through their services are subject to frequent challenges both in the united states and foreign jurisdictions any liabilities incurred as a result of these matters could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business our potential liability to third parties for the userprovided content on our sites particularly in jurisdictions outside the united states where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled may increase if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings which would negatively affect our financial results changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increase our costs and loss rateour ebay and paypal buyer protection programs represent the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded have not received the item that they purchased or have received an item different from what was described in addition users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card company or bank which in turn will seek recovery from paypal we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made our liability for these sort of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some nonus jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for any such thirdparty actions could be costly and time consuming for us divert management attention result in increased costs of doing business lead to adverse judgments or otherwise harm our business in addition affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us including imposing fines or seeking injunctionsover the last several years we have enhanced the buyer and seller protections offered by paypal on certain of our marketplaces and in certain countries and may further enhance those protections in the future changes to paypals buyer and seller protection programs could result in changes and fluctuations in our payments transaction loss rate for the year ended december 31 2014 our payments transaction losses including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled 465 million representing 020 of our net total payment volume our dispute resolution process in the united states the united kingdom canada australia and germany provides that we will generally reimburse the buyer for the full amount of an items purchase price including original shipping costs if the item was not received or if the item received was significantly different from that described in the listing and the seller does not provide adequate resolution to the buyer we have recently simplified the process for filing a dispute resolution claim which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases being opened which has increased our costs associated with the resolutions process these changes could also be negatively received by and lead to dissatisfaction on the part of some of our sellers and may also result in an increase in buyer fraud and associated transaction losses increased costs loss rates or liabilities resulting from our buyer and seller protection programs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial resultswe may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights we believe the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on applicable laws and regulations in the united states and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services including confidentiality and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct businesshowever effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available and contractual arrangements and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property rights by others trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as 27trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could materially harm our businessas the number of products in the software industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlap and as we acquire technology through acquisitions or licenses we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims including patent copyright and trademark infringement claims litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property rights of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is uncertain and regardless of outcome any such claim with or without merit may be timeconsuming result in costly litigation divert managements time and attention from our business require us to stop selling delay shipping or redesign our products or require us to pay substantial amounts to satisfy judgments or settle claims or lawsuits or to pay substantial royalty or licensing fees or to satisfy indemnification obligations that we have with some of our customers our failure to obtain necessary license or other rights or litigation or claims arising out of intellectual property matters may harm our businesschanges to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm paypalpaypal does not directly access the payment card networks such as visa and mastercard that enable paypals acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards as a result paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for the services from time to time payment card networks have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction which accesses their networks paypals payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing any changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase paypals operating costs and reduce its profit margins in addition in some jurisdictions governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees or have opened investigations as to whether visa or mastercards interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law in the united states the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard previously charged in the european union the multilateral interchange fee mif regulation limits credit and debit interchange fees for payments to 03 and 02 respectively the mif regulation which is expected to become effective in the second half of 2015 may significantly impact paypals pricing policy in the european union any such material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the united states or other markets could jeopardize paypals competitive position against traditional credit and debit card processors although it would also lower paypals costs future changes to those regulations or to paypals business could potentially cause paypal to be treated as a payment card network which could subject paypal to additional regulation and require paypal to change its business practices which could reduce paypals revenue and adversely affect paypals business paypal is required by its processors to comply with payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypals customers the payment card networks set and interpret the card operating rules payment card networks have from time to time alleged that various aspects of paypals business model violate these operating rules if such allegations are not resolved they could result in material fines and penalties or require changes in paypals business that may be costly the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or the choice of currency in which they would like their card to be charged if paypal were unable to accept payment cards or meaningfully limited in its ability to do so its business would be seriously damaged paypal and its payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with operating rules for providing services to merchants but any failure to comply could result in fines paypal also could be and in the past has been subject to fines from payment card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk primarily the sale of certain types of digital content for high risk merchants paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with the payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants although the amount of these fines has not been material to date any additional fines in the future could become material and could result in a termination of paypals ability to accept payment cards or require changes in paypals process for registering new customers this would significantly damage paypals business paypals retail pointofsale solution and paypal here product are also subject to payment card network operating rules which may increase the costs of those products or otherwise negatively impact their deployment28changes in how customers fund their paypal transactions can have a material effect on our results of operations paypal pays significant transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when customers fund payments with debit cards nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or through the paypal credit products because customers fund a significant portion of paypals payment volume using credit and debit cards paypals financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its customers fund payments using credit and debit cards some of paypals customers may prefer to use credit and debit cards if these cards offer functionality and benefits not associated with the use of their bank accounts some of paypals offerings including the ability of buyers to make a limited number of guest payments without opening a paypal account have a higher rate of payment card funding than paypals basic product offering an increase in the portion of paypals payment volume using credit and debit cards would materially and adversely affect paypals financial performance some of paypals plans to lower its funding costs including both the paypal credit products and the ability for buyers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions may increase the risk to paypal of nonpayment by buyers if we experience an increase in fees associated with our funding mix or in losses associated with nonpayment by buyers our business and financial results could sufferour credit products and services expose us to additional risksour paypal credit products are offered to a wide range of consumers and the financial success of this business depends on the ability of paypal and the issuing banks of the paypal credit products to manage credit risk related to those products the lenders extend credit at the point of sale using our proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific customers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores these algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment among other factors the accuracy of the predictions and the ability of the lenders and paypal to manage credit risk related to the paypal credit products may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes eg bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations competitors actions changes in consumer behavior and other factors a lender may incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies which may impact the financial performance of the paypal credit products in addition economic and financial conditions in the united states may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit including the credit extended by a lender to consumers who use the paypal credit products which could impair the growth and profitability of our paypal businessover the past several years the volume of credit extended by the financial institutions issuing the paypal credit products has increased in the united states paypal purchases the receivables relating to these consumer loans extended by the issuing banks and therefore bears the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit we face the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations with respect to the consumer loans making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential chargeoffs the rate at which receivables were charged off as uncollectible or the net chargeoff rate was approximately 566 for the year ended december 31 2014 the nonpayment rate among users of paypal credit products may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards by paypal and the financial institutions issuing the paypal credit products worsening economic conditions such as a recession or greater austerity in the united states and high unemployment rates consumers who miss payments on their obligations often fail to repay them and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their loanspaypal has entered into an agreement with synchrony formerly ge capital retail bank pursuant to which paypal one of its affiliates or a third party partner of paypal will subject to certain conditions purchase a dual branded retail credit card portfolio from synchrony with paypal ultimately owning the related receivables this transaction is currently expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 although there can be no assurance that this transaction will close on terms currently contemplated or at all if this transaction is consummated it will increase the risks relating to our ownership of consumer loan receivables in 2013 paypal began a pilot program working with webbank for webbank to offer working capital financing to selected sellers in the united states and for paypal to purchase the related receivables similar programs are also available in the united kingdom and australia loans to merchants would present risks similar to those discussed above associated with the paypal credit productswe purchase receivables related to paypal credit products and other credit accounts through borrowings and cash resources if we are unable to fund our purchase of these receivables adequately or in a costeffective manner or if we are unable to efficiently manage the cash resources utilized to purchase the receivables our results of operations would be significantly and adversely affected29paypal is not a bank or licensed lender and relies upon third parties to make the loans and provide the other services critical to its businessas paypal is neither a chartered financial institution nor licensed to make loans in any state we must rely on a bank or licensed lender to offer the paypal credit products in the united states currently when a consumer makes a purchase using a paypal credit product a chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant we subsequently purchase and retain most of the consumer receivables related to the consumer loans made by the chartered financial institution and as a result of the purchase bear most of the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continues to own each of the customer accounts we own most of the related consumer receivables and we are also responsible for servicing functions related to the customer accountcomenity capital bank and webbank which are both industrial banks chartered by the state of utah currently issue paypal credit products with comenity capital bank originating the majority of new loans as part of this arrangement webbank has agreed to take ownership of and originate loans with respect to all customer accounts in the event of a termination or interruption in comenity capital banks ability to lend nevertheless any termination or interruption of webbanks or comenity capital banks ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new transactions under the paypal credit products which would require us either to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution which if possible at all may not be available on favorable terms or to obtain our own bank charter which would be a timeconsuming and costly process and would subject us to a number of additional laws and regulations compliance with which would be burdensomethe paypal credit products also rely on thirdparty merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions for the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 16 of all transaction volume by dollar amount through the paypal credit products was settled through the facilities of a single vendor any disruption to these thirdparty payment processing and gateway services would adversely affect the paypal credit productspaypals failure to manage customer funds properly could harm its businesspaypals ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers paypal has a limited operating history and limited experience in managing these internal controls as paypals business continues to grow it must continue to strengthen its internal controls accordingly paypals success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage customer funds accurately could severely diminish customer use of paypals products andor result in penalties and fines which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial resultsfailure to deal effectively with fraudulent activities on our websites would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our serviceswe face risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites and periodically receive complaints from buyers and sellers who may not have received the goods that they had contracted to purchase or payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase in some european and asian jurisdictions buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period while we can in some cases suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users we do not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through its buyer protection program which in the united states we refer as the ebay money back guarantee although we have implemented measures to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activities combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective in combating fraudulent transactions or improving overall satisfaction among sellers buyers and other participants additional measures to address fraud could negatively affect the attractiveness of our services to buyers or sellers resulting in a reduction in the ability to attract new users or retain current users damage to our reputation or a diminution in the value of its brand namesfailure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transactions bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our servicespaypal incurs substantial losses due to claims from buyers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or 30services do not match the merchants description paypal seeks to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase from buyer fraud from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by paypal related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in paypal losing the right to accept payment cards for payment in the event that paypal was unable to accept payment cards the number of transactions processed through paypal would decrease substantially and our business would suffer paypal is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants users of paypal credit products and third parties handling its user information paypal has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business will sufferpaypals retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks paypal has announced several retail point of sale solutions which enable merchants to accept payments using a payments card reader attached to or otherwise communicating with a mobile device or to scan payment cards and codes using the mobile devices embedded camera and which will enable customers to use their mobile devices to pay handsfree to the extent that paypal continues to expand its product and service offerings at the retail point of sale we will face additional risks including increased expectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of its systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime which paypal may not be able to meet significant competition at the retail point of sale particularly from established payment card providers such as visa mastercard and american express many of which have substantially greater resources than we do increased targeting by fraudsters and given that our fraud models are less developed in this area we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of saleexposure to product liability claims to the extent that hardware devices that we produce for use at the retail point of sale malfunction or not in compliance with laws  which could result in substantial liability and require product recalls or other actions exposure to new or additional laws and regulations increased reliance on third parties involved with processing instore payments including independent software providers electronic point of sale providers hardware providers such as cash register and pinpad providers payment processors and banks that enable instore transactions andlower profit margins than paypals other payment solutionsunless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may sufferour enterprise business exposes us to additional risksour enterprise business faces its own risks and challenges competition for enterprises existing and potential clients is intense and our enterprise business may not be able to add new clients or keep existing clients on favorable terms or at all for example a change in the management of an enterprise client could adversely affect our relationship with that client in addition many of enterprises client contracts contain service level commitments if our enterprise business is unable to meet these commitments its relationships with its clients could be damaged and client rights to terminate their contracts with our enterprise business andor financial penalty provisions payable by our enterprise business may be triggered these contracts contain provisions under which our enterprise business has agreed to indemnify enterprise clients against certain claims by third parties regarding our products and services if any existing enterprise clients in particular the large merchants and brands that our enterprise business serves were to exit the business we provide services to be acquired declare bankruptcy suffer other financial difficulties make indemnification claims against us fail to pay amounts owed to our enterprise business andor terminate or modify their relationships with our enterprise business in an unfavorable manner our enterprise business could be adversely affecteda portion of enterprises net transaction revenue is derived from the value of ecommerce transactions that flow through its suite of commerce technologies accordingly growth in enterprises net transaction revenue depends upon the continued growth of the online businesses of its clients our enterprise business may be substantially impacted by any adverse conditions in the offline businesses of an enterprise client that negatively impact that clients online businesses any impairment of the offline business of enterprise clients whether due to financial difficulties impairment of client brands reduction in marketing efforts reduction in the number of client retail stores or otherwise could negatively affect consumer traffic and sales through 31enterprise clients websites which would result in lower revenues generated by our enterprise business our enterprise business also relies on its clients ability to accurately forecast product demand and select and buy the inventory for their corresponding online businesses under such arrangements the client establishes product prices and pays our enterprise business fees based either on a fixed or variable percentage of revenues or on the activity performed as a result if enterprise clients fail to accurately forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory the clients ecommerce business and in turn our enterprise fees could be adversely affectedour enterprise business holds some inventory on behalf of its clients if our enterprise business is unable to effectively manage and handle this inventory this may result in unexpected costs that could adversely affect our enterprise business any theft of such inventory or damage or interruption to such inventory including as a result of earthquakes hurricanes floods fire power loss labor disputes terrorist attacks and similar events and disruptions could result in losses related to such inventory and disruptions to the businesses of enterprise clients which could in turn adversely affect our enterprise business while we have insurance coverage to protect against such losses it may be inadequate to cover all losses and we may not be able to fully collect if at all under these insurance policiesour enterprise business processes personal information on behalf of its clients the personal information on customers of certain websites operated by enterprise clients may be regulated under applicable privacy laws and regulations in some cases enterprises use or disclosure of that information may be restricted by contractual terms laws and regulations and any misuse or unpermitted disclosure of that information could negatively impact our enterprise business and its clientsour enterprise business is in the process of enhancing its marketing solutions platform and plans to migrate existing clients to its new marketing solutions platform our enterprise business could be negatively impacted if this project is delayed the functionality of the new marketing solutions platform is not accepted by existing or new clients or the new marketing solutions platform does not operate as expectedour enterprise business utilizes email marketing to drive consumer traffic to the websites operated by some of its clients email could become a less effective means of communicating with and marketing to consumers for a variety of reasons including problems with technology that make enterprises email communications more difficult to deliver and for consumers to read eg the inability of some mobile devices to adequately display email consumers may disregard marketing emails due to the large volume of such emails they receive the inability of filters to effectively screen for unwanted emails resulting in increased levels of junk mail or spam which may overwhelm consumers email accounts increased use of social networking sites which may result in decreased use of email as a primary means of communication continued security concerns regarding internet usage in general from viruses worms or similar problems and increased governmental regulation or restrictive policies adopted by internet service providers that make it more difficult or costly to utilize email for marketing communications if any of our enterprise entities were to end up on spam lists or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted unsolicited emails their ability to contact customers through email could be significantly restricted if any of the foregoing were to occur the demand for enterprise email marketing solutions could decrease and our enterprise business could be harmed our enterprise business also utilizes mobile messaging as a means of communicating with consumers which carries risks similar to those described above for email marketingour enterprise business has relationships with search engines comparison shopping sites affiliate marketers online advertising networks and other websites to provide content advertising banners and other links to its clients ecommerce businesses our enterprise business relies on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to its clients ecommerce businesses if we are unable to maintain these relationships or enter into new relationships on acceptable terms our ability to attract new customers could be harmedebay and our enterprise businesses are party to certain acquisition agreements relating to entities purchased by gsi commerce prior to our acquisition of gsi commerce these agreements could subject us to liabilities which could harm our enterprise businesswe have substantial indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our business to service our indebtedness failure to comply with the terms of our indebtedness could result in the acceleration of our indebtedness which could have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquiditywe have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences 32including without limitation any of the following requiring the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes including capital expenditures and acquisitionsour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to downturns in our business to competitive pressures and to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditionsadverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costsour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or other general corporate and other purposes may be limited andour flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry may be limitedour ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things repatriate funds to the united states at substantial tax costseek additional financing in the debt or equity marketsrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtednesssell selected assets orreduce or delay planned capital or operating expendituressuch measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at allour revolving credit facility and the indenture pursuant to which certain of our outstanding debt securities were issued contain and any debt instruments we enter into in the future may contain financial and other covenants that restrict or could restrict among other things our business and operations if we fail to pay amounts due under or breach any of the covenants in a debt instrument then the lenders would typically have the right to demand immediate repayment of all borrowings thereunder subject in certain cases to grace or cure period moreover any such acceleration and required repayment of or default in respect of any of our indebtedness could in turn constitute an event of default under other debt instruments thereby resulting in the acceleration and required repayment of that other indebtedness any of these events could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial conditiona downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our businessthe credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based upon among other things our results of operations and financial condition these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and there can be no assurance that any rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future moreover these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold any of our debt securities actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook would likely increase our borrowing costs which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flows and could also have a material adverse effect on the market value of the our common stock and outstanding debt securities as of january 1 2014 our longterm debt and shortterm funding were rated investment grade by standard and poors financial services llc longterm rated a shortterm rated a1 with a stable outlook moodys investor service longterm rated a2 shortterm rated p1 with a stable outlook and fitch ratings inc longterm rated a shortterm rated f1 with a stable outlook following the september 2014 announcement of our planned separation of our paypal business standard and poors financial services llc and moodys investor service placed our longterm debt and shortterm funding ratings under review with negative implications while fitch ratings inc downgraded our longterm debt from a to a and shortterm funding from f1 to f2 retaining our investment grade status and has also placed those ratings under review with negative implications we did not experience any material operational funding or liquidity impacts from this rating downgrade we expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor developments in our planned separation of paypal including the capital structure for each company after separation which could result in additional downgrades we disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of our ratings on our costs of funds our borrowing 33costs depend in part on our credit ratings and the actions already taken by these credit rating agencies as described above will likely increase and any further downgrades would likely increase our borrowing costs our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxesthe application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax vat goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses and to our users is a complex and evolving issue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or ecommerce in addition governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues including through indirect taxes there are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertainwe do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services however some jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws that require outofstate sellers of tangible personal property to collect and remit taxes in particular the streamlined sales tax project an ongoing multiyear effort by us state and local governments to pursue federal legislation that would require collection and remittance of remote sales tax by outofstate sellers could allow states that meet certain simplification and other standards to require outofstate sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by instate residents the adoption of such legislation could result in a use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers this collection responsibility and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection remittance and audit requirements would make selling on our websites and mobile platforms less attractive for small business retailers and would harm our business and the proliferation of state legislation to expand sales and use tax collection on internet sales could adversely affect some of our sellers and indirectly harm our businessseveral proposals have been made at the us state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet these proposals if adopted could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities while the us federal governments moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been extended through october 2015 this moratorium does not prohibit federal state or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium andor one of its extensions from time to time some taxing authorities in the united states have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on our or our affiliates services these notifications have not resulted in any significant tax liabilities to date but there is a risk that some jurisdiction may be successful in the future which would harm our businesssimilar issues exist outside of the united states where the application of vat or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers is uncertain and evolving while we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due certain of our subsidiaries have from time to time received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees we have been paying vat on fees charged to certain of our users in the european union based on the service providers location on january 1 2015 changes to the rules determining the place of supply and thus the country of taxation for all european union based providers of electronically supplied services were implemented that require that we pay vat based on the residence or normal place of business of our customers these changes may result in our paying a higher rate of vat on such fees additionally we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate in most cases we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries however because of our unique business model the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our businessin certain jurisdictions we collect and remit indirect taxes however tax authorities may raise questions about our obligation to collect and remit such taxes as well as the proper calculation of such taxes should any new taxes become applicable to our fees or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient our business could be harmed a taxing authority may seek to impose a tax collection reporting or recordkeeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce any failure by us to meet these requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our business taxing authorities may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction regardless of where the respective users are located some jurisdictions could assert that we or an affiliate is responsible for tax on the underlying goods or services sold on our sites imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business foreign authorities may also require us to help ensure compliance by our 34users with local laws regulating professional sellers including tax requirements in addition we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce and any use of those records to investigate collect taxes from or prosecute sellers could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our businesswe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilitiesthe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate governments are focused on ways to increase revenues which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and stances taken by tax authorities our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world including with respect to our tax structure any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficientin addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of losses in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in light of continuing fiscal challenges in the united states and many countries in europe various levels of government are also increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue including corporate income taxes for example the economic downturn reduced tax revenues for united states federal and state governments and a number of proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities have been implemented or are being considered at various levels of government these include a number of proposals to modify the us federal income tax laws applicable to companies like ours operating in multiple us and foreign jurisdictions which if enacted could materially increase our effective tax rate a number of us states have attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state and taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions may take similar actions many us states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable incomeloss attributable to their state from certain outofstate businesses companies that operate over the internet such as ebay are a target of some of these efforts if more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to internet companies that do not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction this could increase our effective tax ratewe continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or taxrelated reporting requirements could harm our users and our business there has been an increased interest by certain governing and regulatory bodies as well as the international press especially in europe in the tax affairs of multinational and ecommerce companies while this increased scrutiny has not resulted in any changes in the way taxes are imposed it could lead to changes in laws or critical investigations of our operations and structure in the future this could lead to additional tax costs and harm our businessour users and we may be subject to sales reporting and recordkeeping obligationsone or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose reporting or recordkeeping obligations on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several states and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if one of our companies was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which it operates in july 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 was signed into us federal law this law contains provisions that require companies that provide payments over electronic means to users to report to the internal revenue service irs information on payments received by certain customers the legislation effective for payments received after december 31 2010 requires paypal and other electronic payments processors to report to the irs on customers 35subject to us income tax who receive more than 20000 in payments and more than 200 payments in a calendar year as a result we are required to request tax id numbers from certain payees track payments by tax id number and under certain conditions withhold a portion of payments and forward such withholding to the irs we have modified our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations the irs regulations also require us to collect a certification of nonus taxpayer status from certain international merchants the foreign account tax compliance act which took effect at the start of 2013 is likely to require an increase in the number of nonus customers from whom we must obtain a similar certification and to increase the compliance burdens on us these requirements may decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business any failure by us to meet these new requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our businessour business is subject to online security risks including security breachesour businesses involve the storage and transmission of users proprietary information in addition a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us an increasing number of websites including those owned by several other large internet and offline companies have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through various means including hacking into our systems or facilities fraud trickery or other means of deceiving our employees contractors and temporary staff a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users proprietary information cause interruption in our operations damage our computers or those of our users or otherwise damage our reputation in addition our users have been and likely will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate user names passwords payment card numbers or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our users computers as a result our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security incidents and third parties may be able to access our users proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through our systems any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and reputation any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similar effectsin may 2014 we publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate and steal certain data including user names encrypted user passwords and other nonfinancial user data from marketplaces business unit upon making this announcement marketplaces required all buyers and sellers on the marketplaces platform to reset their passwords in order to log into their account the breach and subsequent password reset have negatively impacted the business in july 2014 a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the breach we have filed a motion to dismiss in this matter in addition we have received requests for information and are subject to investigations regarding this incident from numerous regulatory and other government agencies across the worldin addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by paypals direct payment card processing customers we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses if we were unable to accept payment cards our businesses would be seriously damaged additionally financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the united states and the european union have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant costs on paypal require paypal to change its business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the ease of use of its products which could harm paypals business we may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches these issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of places where we operate additionally our insurance policies carry low coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches and we may not be able to fully collect if at all under these insurance policiessystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business our systems may experience service interruptions or degradation because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions computer denialofservice and often cyberattacks human error earthquakes hurricanes floods fires natural 36disasters power losses disruptions in telecommunications services fraud military or political conflicts terrorist attacks computer viruses or other events our systems are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities as a result we have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures denial of service attacks and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce the speed or functionality of our websites and mobile applications these events have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue and a prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the speed or other functionality of our websites and mobile applications and could have a material adverse effect on our result of operations and financial condition frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites and could permanently harm our reputation and brands in addition agreements between our enterprise business and some of its clients contain commitments regarding availability if our enterprise business is unable to meet these commitments its relationship with its clients could be damaged and may trigger a clients right to terminate their contract with our enterprise business andor financial penalty provisions payable by our enterprise business moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event results in damages to our customers or their businesses these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses and those claims even if unsuccessful would likely be timeconsuming and costly for us to address we also rely on facilities components and services supplied by third parties and our business may be materially adversely affected to the extent these components or services do not meet our expectations or these third parties cease to provide the services or facilities in particular a decision by any of our third party hosting providers to close a facility that we use could cause system interruptions and delays result in loss of critical data and cause lengthy interruptions in our services we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar eventsour paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as 12 days including for example transaction failures which affected some customers in the uk for over 24 hours in august 2014 and mobile login failures which affected some customers for several hours in april 2014 reliability is particularly critical for paypal because the fulltime availability of paypal is critical to its goal of gaining widespread acceptance among users and merchants as a retail point of sale solutions because paypal is a regulated financial institution frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fines and penalties or mandatory and costly changes to paypals business practices and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expandacquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences we have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope technologies services and products we also expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as strategic investments and joint ventures in that regard in january 2015 we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our enterprise business including a possible sale or initial public offering although there can be no assurance that any such transaction will be consummated these transactions and in particular the january 2015 announcement regarding our enterprise business may involve significant challenges and risks includingthe potential loss of key customers merchants vendors and other key business partners of the companies we acquire or dispose of following and continuing after announcement of our transaction plansdeclining employee morale and retention issues affecting employees of companies that we acquire or dispose of which may result from changes in compensation or changes in management reporting relationships future prospects or the direction of the acquired or disposed businessdifficulty making new and strategic hires of new employeesdiversion of management time and a shift of focus from operating the businesses to the transaction and in the case of an acquisition integration and administrationthe need to integrate the operations systems including accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems technologies products and personnel of each acquired company which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a resultthe need to implement or improve controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition may have lacked such controls procedures and policies or whose controls 37procedures and policies did not meet applicable legal and other standardsrisks associated with our expansion into new international marketsderivative lawsuits resulting from the acquisitionliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes violations of laws rules and regulations commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilitiesthe potential loss of key employees following the transactionthe acquisition of new customer and employee personal information which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure andour dependence on the acquired business accounting financial reporting operating metrics and similar systems controls and processes and the risk that errors or irregularities in those systems controls and processes will lead to errors in our consolidated financial statements or make it more difficult to manage the acquired businessat any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions and any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations in addition it may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions and those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results any acquisitions or dispositions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill which could adversely affect our results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders we have made certain investments including through joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest andor lack management and operational control the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture our strategic investments may also expose us to additional risks any circumstances which may be out of our control that adversely affect the value of our investments or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments could harm our business or negatively impact our financial resultsour success largely depends on key personnel because competition for our key employees is intense we may not be able to attract retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business the loss of senior management or other key personnel could negatively affect our businessour future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including key engineering and product development personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley where our corporate headquarters are located and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment and fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any key person life insurance policies the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel could harm our businessproblems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our businessa number of third parties provide services to us or to our users such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software storefronts that help our users list items and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform among others paypal is dependent on caching services that make its sites load faster the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions among others paypal is subject to among other things increases in interchange fees and assessments that payment card networks such as visa and mastercard charge for each transaction using one of their cards which paypals payment card processors have the right to pass on to paypal as well as changes in payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for internet payment services such as paypal similarly paypal relies on unaffiliated lenders to make the consumer and other loans originated through the paypal credit products and also relies heavily on third parties to operate its services including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions financial or regulatory issues labor issues eg strikes lockouts or work stoppages or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could harm our business38price increases by or service terminations disruptions or interruptions at companies that provide services to us and our users and clients could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions or for us to timely fulfill and ship products sold on the websites operated by enterprise clients thereby harming our business some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint in addition the us postal service which is facing ongoing fiscal challenges has instituted postal rate increases and announced that it is considering closing thousands of local post offices and ending saturday mail delivery while we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance their shipping experience postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers offerings and postal service changes could require certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient which could in turn decrease the number of transactions on our sites thereby harming our business we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty providers including some customer support and product development functions which are critical to our operations if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily our operations could be disrupted which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect the number of transactions we support and our business reputation and operating resultsthere can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to us or our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all if any third parties were to stop providing services to us or our users on acceptable terms including as a result of bankruptcy we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all our developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional riskswe provide thirdparty developers with access to application programming interfaces software development kits and other tools designed to allow them to produce applications for use with a particular focus on mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms or tools could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could adversely affect our businessrisk factors related to the planned separation our plan to separate paypal into an independent publicly traded company is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline or at all in september 2014 we announced a plan to separate paypal into an independent public company we expect to complete the separation in the second half of 2015 subject to board approval of the final terms of the separation and market regulatory and certain other conditions we also announced that following separation devin wenig currently president of marketplaces will become ceo of ebay and that dan schulman currently president of paypal will become ceo of the standalone paypal companyunanticipated developments including changes in the competitive conditions of ebays and paypals respective markets possible delays in obtaining various tax opinions or rulings regulatory approvals or clearances uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes and executing the separation could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected we expect that the process of completing the proposed separation will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the separation is not completed executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and key employees which could distract them from operating our business disrupt operations and result in the loss of business opportunities which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating key employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion which could harm our businessesthe proposed separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits and may adversely affect our business even if the proposed separation is completed we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the 39separation and the separation may in fact adversely affect our business as independent publicly traded companies ebay and paypal will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions which could materially and adversely affect their respective businesses financial condition and results of operations separating the businesses may also eliminate or reduce synergies that existed prior to the separation which could have an adverse effect on the results of operations financial condition and liquidity of each business there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies following the completion of the proposed separation will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurredthe proposed separation may result in disruptions to and negatively impact our relationships with our customers and other business partners and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employeesuncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects the proposed separation and related uncertainties may also make it more difficult for us to attract new employees or to retain current employees and may make our stock options and other equity awards less attractive to current and prospective employees the effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation in addition as independent standalone entities ebay and paypal may be unable to obtain goods services financing and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained by ebay inc prior to the separationthe potential negative impact of the events described above could not only adversely affect the individual ebay and paypal businesses following their separation into independent companies but could also adversely affect our company as currently constituted40item 1b unresolved staff commentsnot applicable item 2 properties we own and lease various properties in the us and 32 other countries around the

believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our immediate needs it may become necessary to develop and improve land that we own or lease or acquire additional or alternative space to accommodate any future growth item 3 legal proceedings litigation and regulatory proceedingsoverviewwe are involved in legal and regulatory proceedings on an ongoing basis many of these proceedings are in early stages and may seek an indeterminate amount of damages if we believe that a loss arising from such matters is probable and can be reasonably estimated we accrue the estimated liability in our financial statements if only a range of estimated losses can be determined we accrue an amount within the range that in our judgment reflects the most likely outcome if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount we accrue the low end of the range for those proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we have disclosed an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses or we have concluded that an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising directly from the proceeding ie monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement are not material if we cannot estimate the probable or reasonably possible loss or range of losses arising from a legal proceeding we have disclosed that fact in assessing the materiality of a legal proceeding we evaluate among other factors the amount of monetary damages claimed as well as the potential impact of nonmonetary remedies sought by plaintiffs eg injunctive relief that may require us to change our business practices in a manner that could have a material adverse impact on our business with respect to the matters disclosed in this item 3 we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of such nonmonetary remediesamounts accrued for legal and regulatory proceedings for which we believe a loss is probable were not material for the year ended december 31 2014 except as otherwise noted for the proceedings described in this item 3 we have concluded based on currently available information that reasonably possible losses arising directly from the proceedings ie monetary damages or amounts paid in judgment or settlement in excess of our recorded accruals are also not material however legal and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties if one or more matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations the impact on our operating results or financial condition for that reporting period could be material 41litigationebays korean subsidiary iac which has merged into gmarket and is now named ebay korea has notified its approximately 20 million users of a january 2008 data breach involving personally identifiable information including name address resident registration number and some transaction and refund data but not including credit card information or real time banking information approximately 149000 users sued iac over this breach in several lawsuits in korean courts and more may do so in the future including after final determination of liability trial for a group of representative suits began in august 2009 in the seoul central district court scdc and trial for additional suits began later in the scdc there is some precedent in korea for a court to grant consolation money for data breaches without a specific finding of harm from the breach such precedents have involved payments of up to approximately 200 per user in january 2010 the scdc ruled that iac had met its obligations with respect to defending the website from intrusion and accordingly had no liability for the breach this january 2010 ruling was appealed by approximately 34000 plaintiffs to the seoul high court in september 2012 the seoul high court announced its decision upholding the scdcs january 2010 decision for three cases involving 55 plaintiffs during 2013 the seoul high court upheld the scdcs january 2010 ruling in another 18 cases involving 33795 plaintiffs the seoul high courts decision in 10 of these 18 cases has been appealed by 33215 plaintiffs to the korea supreme court and the korea supreme court is currently reviewing a total of 11 cases with 33218 plaintiffs in january 2013 the seoul western district court ruled in favor of iac with respect to two cases filed by 2291 plaintiffs by following the scdcs january 2010 ruling and 2284 plaintiffs proceeded to appeal this decision of the seoul western district court to the seoul high court we expect decisions in these cases in 2015ebay inc ebay domestic holdings inc pierre omidyar and joshua silverman have been sued by craigslist inc in california superior court in san francisco case no cgc  08  475276 craigslist filed suit on may 13 2008 alleging that we engaged in conduct designed to harm craigslists business while we negotiated to become and while we were a minority shareholder in craigslist craigslists allegations include that we i misrepresented concealed suppressed and failed to disclose facts in order to induce craigslist to take detrimental action ii interfered with craigslists business operations iii improperly disseminated and misused confidential and proprietary information from craigslist that we received as a minority investor iv infringed and diluted craigslists trademark and trade name and v breached duties owed to craigslist the complaint seeks significant compensatory and punitive damages rescission and other relief in addition in september 2014 craigslist filed an amended complaint alleging trade secret misappropriation and seeking new and additional compensatory and punitive damages the parties are currently engaged in discovery and a trial date has not yet been set regulatory proceedings paypal routinely reports to the us department of the treasurys office of foreign assets control ofac on payments it has rejected or blocked pursuant to ofac sanctions regulations and on any possible violations of those regulations paypal has cooperated with ofac in recent years regarding paypals review process over transaction monitoring and has selfreported a large number of small dollar amount transactions that could possibly be in violation of ofac sanctions regulations beginning in september 2014 we have engaged in settlement discussions with ofac regarding the possible violations arising from paypals practices between 2009 and 2013 as a result of which we have accrued reserves we believe are adequate to cover any findings of violation in addition paypal continues to cooperate with ofac regarding more recent selfreported transactions that could also possibly be in violation of ofac sanctions regulations such selfreporting transactions could result in claims or actions against us including litigation injunctions damage awards or require us to change our business practices and could result in a material loss require significant management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business on august 7 2013 and january 13 2014 ebay paypal and its subsidiary bill me later received civil investigative demands cids from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb requesting that we provide testimony produce documents and provide information relating primarily to the acquisition management and operation of the paypal credit products including online credit products advertising loan origination customer acquisition servicing debt collection and complaints handling practices the cids could lead to an enforcement action andor one or more significant consent orders which may result in substantial costs including legal fees fines penalties and remediation expenses we are cooperating with the cfpb in connection with the cids and exploring whether we may be able to resolve these inquiries resolution of these inquiries could require us to make monetary payments to certain customers pay fines andor change the manner in which we operate the paypal credit products which could adversely affect our financial results and results of operationsin may 2014 we publicly announced that criminals were able to penetrate our network and steal certain data including user names encrypted user passwords and other nonfinancial user data from ebays marketplaces business unit upon making this announcement ebay marketplaces required all buyers and sellers on the marketplaces platform to reset their passwords in order to login to their account in addition to making this public announcement we proactively approached a number of 42regulatory and governmental bodies including those with the most direct supervisory authority over our data privacy and data security programs to specifically inform them of the incident and our actions to protect our customers in response certain of those regulatory agencies have requested us to provide further more detailed information regarding the incident and we believe that we have fully cooperated in all of those requests to date we have not been informed by any regulatory authority of an intention to bring any enforcement action arising from this incident however in the future we may be subject to fines or other regulatory action in addition in july 2014 a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us for alleged violations and harm resulting from the incident we are vigorously defending the lawsuit general mattersother third parties have from time to time claimed and others may claim in the future that we have infringed their intellectual property rights we are subject to patent disputes and expect that we will increasingly be subject to additional patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces payments and enterprise businesses as our products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity such claims may be brought directly or indirectly against our companies andor against our customers who may be entitled to contractual indemnification under their contracts with us and we are subject to increased exposure to such claims as a result of our recent acquisitions particularly in cases where we are entering into new lines of business in connection with such acquisitions we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims we may also become more vulnerable to thirdparty claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts and as we expand the scope of our businesses both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations and become subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries like ourselves are either unclear or less favorable we believe that additional lawsuits alleging that we have violated patent copyright or trademark laws will be filed against us intellectual property claims whether meritorious or not are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve could require expensive changes in our methods of doing business or could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable termsfrom time to time we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business including suits by our users individually or as class actions alleging among other things improper disclosure of our prices rules or policies that our practices prices rules policies or customeruser agreements violate applicable law or that we have acted unfairly andor not acted in conformity with such prices rules policies or agreements in addition to these types of disputes and regulatory inquiries our operations are also subject to regulatory andor legal review andor challenges that tend to reflect the increasing global regulatory focus to which the payments industry is subject and when taken as a whole with other regulatory and legislative action such actions could result in the imposition of costly new compliance burdens on our payments business and its customers and may lead to increased costs and decreased transaction volume and revenue further the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries are increasing as our company has grown larger our businesses have expanded in scope both in terms of the range of products and services that we offer and our geographical operations and our products and services have increased in complexity any claims or regulatory actions against us whether meritorious or not could be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement require us to change our business practices in expensive ways require significant amounts of management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business
