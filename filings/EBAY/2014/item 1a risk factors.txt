significantly different from historical or projected rates our operating results in one or more future quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors in that event the trading price of our common stock would almost certainly decline we invest heavily in technology marketing and promotion customer support protection programs and further development of the operating infrastructure for our operations some of this investment entails longterm contractual 13commitments as a result we may be unable to adjust our spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall which may harm our profitability the growth of internet users is slowing in many countries where we have a significant presence as our growth rates in established markets slow we will increasingly need to focus on keeping existing marketplaces users especially our top buyers and sellers and paypal account holders especially in our merchant services business active and increasing their activity level on our websites and mobile platforms in order to continue to grow those businesses the growth of internet users is accelerating in some countries and regions where we do not have a significant presence eg brazillatin america russia china and certain other countries in which we do not have a meaningful or in some cases any domestic business if we are unable to establish our businesses and drive adoption of our services in such markets our future growth would be negatively impacted if users in such markets exhibit different behaviors than those from our more developed markets we might see fewer interactions lower levels of engagement lower conversion andor lower values of each interaction or conversion and our businesses could be harmedmobile commerce and mobile payments represent an increasingly important part of our businesses our users who have joined andor primarily interact with us through mobile devices may exhibit different behaviors than our more traditional internet ecommerce and payments users if this results in fewer interactions lower levels of engagement lower conversion andor lower values of each interaction or conversion our businesses could be harmedour payments business continues to face increased competitive pressure including from relatively new competitors and large internet companies in particular user sophistication and technological advances have increased expectations around the user experience for online and mobile payments including speed of response and ease of use for both merchants and consumers if we are unable to continue to adapt our services in ways that improve the user experience and increase user engagement our growth in revenue and global active accounts may be negatively impacted which could harm our businessour marketplaces business continues to face increased competitive pressure online and offline in particular the competitive norm for and the expected level of service from internet ecommerce and mobile commerce has significantly increased due to among other factors improved user experience greater ease of buying goods lower or no shipping costs faster shipping times and more favorable return policies if we are unable to change our services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the internet ecommerce and mobile commerce marketplaces particularly the higher growth of sales of fixedprice items and higher expected service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms our business will suffer we regularly announce changes to our marketplaces business intended to drive more sales and improve seller efficiency and buyer experiences and trust some of the changes that we have announced to date have been controversial with and led to dissatisfaction among our sellers and additional changes that we announce in the future may also be negatively received by some of our sellers this may not only impact the supply of items listed on our websites but because many sellers also buy from our websites it may adversely impact demand as well given the number of recent changes that we have made and continue to make to our policies and pricing it may take our sellers some time to fully assess and adjust to these changes and sellers may elect to reduce volume on our websites and mobile platforms while making such assessments and adjustments or in response to these changes if any of these changes cause sellers to move their business in whole or in part away from our websites and mobile platforms or otherwise fail to improve gross merchandise volume or the number of successful listings our operating results and profitability will be harmed we believe that the mix of sales under our traditional auctionstyle listing format and fixedprice listing format will continue to shift towards our fixedprice format accordingly we have eliminated some of the features related to our traditional auctionstyle format and expect others will continue to become less meaningful to and used less frequently by our sellers resulting in a corresponding decrease in revenues from those features we also expect that the costs associated with our seller discount programs will continue to increase as more sellers become eligible for such discounts in addition because a large percentage of paypal transactions originate on the marketplaces platform declines in growth rates in major marketplaces markets also adversely affect paypals growth the expected future growth of our paypal enterprise stubhub and our other lower margin businesses may also cause downward pressure on our profit margins because those businesses have lower gross margins than our marketplaces platforms 14the sluggish economy and the sovereign debt crisis could harm our business our marketplaces payments and enterprise businesses are dependent on consumer purchases and our enterprise business is also impacted by the offline businesses of our enterprise clients the economic downturn resulted in reduced buyer demand and reduced selling prices and the slow recovery and potential impact of a shutdown of the us government a failure to raise the debt ceiling or automatic sequesters as well as the impact of the sovereign debt crisis and resulting austerity measures in europe may reduce the volume and prices of purchases on our marketplaces platforms the volume and prices of transactions paid for using our payment services and the online and offline businesses of our enterprise clients any of which would adversely affect our business these macroeconomic factors could also have a negative and adverse impact on companies with which we do business which in turn could have a further adverse effect on our businesswe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates because we generate the majority of our revenues outside the us but report our financial results in us dollars our financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with its multicurrency service paypal fixes exchange rates twice per day and may face financial exposure if it incorrectly fixes the exchange rate or if exposure reports are delayed given that paypal also holds some corporate and customer funds in nonus currencies its financial results are affected by the translation of these nonus currencies into us dollars in addition the results of operations of many of our internationally focused websites are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars upon consolidation if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased revenues operating expenses and net income similarly if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies our translation of foreign currency denominated transactions will result in lower net revenues operating expenses and net income for the year ended december 31 2013 foreign currency movements relative to the us dollar positively impacted our net revenues of 160 billion by more than 24 million net of a negative impact from hedging activities included in paypals net revenue of approximately 4 million compared to the prior year as foreign currency exchange rates vary relative to the us dollar net revenues and other operating results when translated may differ materially from expectations in particular to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro british pound korean won australian dollar or canadian dollar our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced as a result of these translation adjustments while from time to time we enter into transactions to hedge portions of our foreign currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or completely eliminate the effects of this exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results which may result in an impact on the price of our stockin addition we face exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relatively low interest rates have continued to limit our investment income including income we earn on paypal customer balances in addition we may incur additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offerings of debt securities or through the credit markets a rise in interest rates would increase the cost of such indebtedness in the future fluctuations in interest rates that limit our investment income andor increase the cost of future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial resultsbill me laters operations depend on lending services provided by unaffiliated lenders in november 2008 we acquired bill me later a company that facilitates credit services offered by unaffiliated banks bill me later is neither a chartered financial institution nor is it licensed to make loans in any state accordingly bill me later must rely on a bank or licensed lender to issue the bill me later credit products and extend credit to consumers to offer the bill me later service currently when a consumer makes a purchase using a bill me later credit product a chartered financial institution extends credit to the consumer funds the extension of credit at the point of sale and advances funds to the merchant we subsequently purchase and retain most of the consumer receivables related to the consumer loans made by the chartered financial institution and as a result of the purchase bear most of the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults although the chartered financial institution continues to own each of the customer accounts we own most of the related consumer receivables and bill me later is also responsible for servicing functions related to the customer account in september 2010 webbank became the issuer of the bill me later credit products in august 2013 comenity capital bank became an issuer of the bill me later credit products and webbank transferred most of the customer accounts that it owned to comenity capital bank as part of this arrangement we sell comenity capital bank a participation interest in the entire pool of consumer receivables outstanding under the customer accounts that it originates in addition webbank will continue to originate loans on those accounts that it retained bill me later also has put in place an arrangement with webbank whereby webbank has agreed to resume ownership of and resume lending with respect to all customer accounts in 15the event of a termination or interruption in comenity capital banks ability to lend however if such a termination or interruption occurs with little or no advance notice the origination of new transactions under the bill me later program will not be possible until the new arrangement is implemented which could materially and adversely affect bill me laters business both comenity capital bank and webbank are industrial banks chartered by the state of utah any termination or interruption of webbanks or comenity capital banks ability to lend could result in the inability to originate any new transactions under the bill me later program which would require us either to reach a similar arrangement with another chartered financial institution which if possible at all may not be available on favorable terms or to obtain our own bank charter which would be a timeconsuming and costly process and would subject us to a number of additional laws and regulations compliance with which would be burdensome in may 2010 a lawsuit was filed against bill me later paypal and ebay in california state court alleging that in its relationship with the chartered financial institution bill me later is acting as the true lender to customers and violating various california laws including the states usury law that suit was later removed to the us district court for the central district of california in september 2011 webbank requested to intervene in the action and was added as a party to the action in october 2011 the court transferred the case to the us district court for the district of utah following the transfer the utah court allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to amend the complaint and plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in february 2012 we and webbank filed a motion to dismiss all claims in the amended complaint in march 2012 a hearing on the motion was held by the court in september 2012 and the matter is still before the court we believe that plaintiffs allegations are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously however this area of law is uncertain and if the lawsuit is successful bill me later may be required to change its methods of operations pay very substantial damages and reduce some of its charges and fees which would adversely affect our business our payments business is subject to a number of laws and regulations including those governing banking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange and payment services that vary in the markets where we operate our payments business is subject to various laws and regulations in the us and other countries where it operates including those governing banking crossborder and domestic money transmission foreign exchange and payment services such as payment processing and settlement services the legal and regulatory requirements that apply to our payments business vary in the markets where we operate and have increased over time as the geographical scope and complexity of our business and products have expanded while our payments business has a compliance program focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and has significantly increased the resources of that program in the last several years there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to fines or other enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions or be required to make changes to our business practices or compliance programs to comply in the future any new laws and regulations or changes to or expansion of the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations applicable to our payments business could subject us to additional laws and regulations additional licensure requirements and increased regulatory scrutiny which could force us to change our business practices or limit our ability to grow our business costs associated with fines enforcement actions changes in compliance requirements or limits on our ability to grow our business could have an adverse effect on our financial results and harm our payments business while paypal currently allows its customers with credit cards to send payments from approximately 193 markets paypal only allows customers in 110 of those markets including the us to receive payments in some cases with significant restrictions on the manner in which customers can withdraw funds these limitations may affect paypals ability to grow in these markets of the markets whose residents can use the paypal service 32 28 countries plus four french overseas departments are members of the european union or eu since 2007 paypal has provided localized versions of its service to customers in the eu through paypal europe sà rl et cie sca a whollyowned subsidiary of paypal that is licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg by the commission de surveillance du secteur financier cssf accordingly paypal europe is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization funds management corporate governance information security sanctions or other requirements imposed on luxembourg banks any fines or other enforcement actions imposed by the luxembourg regulator could adversely affect paypals business paypal europe implements its localized services in eu countries through a passport notification process through the luxembourg regulator to regulators in other eu member states pursuant to eu directives and has completed the passport notification process in all eu member countries other than croatia the regulators in these countries could notify paypal europe of local consumer protection laws that apply to its business in addition to luxembourg consumer protection law and could also seek to persuade the luxembourg regulator to order paypal europe to conduct its activities in the local country through a branch office these or similar actions by these regulators could increase the cost of or delay paypals plans for expanding its business in eu countries in addition national interpretations of regulations implementing the eu payment services directive which established a new regulatory regime for payment services providers in 2009 may be 16inconsistent which could make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to manage the european commission has proposed revisions to the payments services directive which could further make compliance more costly and operationally difficult to managein australia paypal serves its customers through paypal australia pty ltd which is licensed by the australian securities investment commission as a financial product and by the australian prudential regulatory authority as a purchased payment facility provider which is a type of authorized depository institution accordingly paypal australia is subject to significant fines or other enforcement action if it violates the disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements imposed on australian depository institutions in china paypal serves its customers through paypal pte ltdto date paypal has obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter or its equivalent in 47 us states the district of columbia puerto rico and the us virgin islands paypal is also licensed as an escrow agent in one us state the two remaining us states where paypal has not applied for a license do not currently regulate money transmitters braintrees subsidiary venmo provides its peertopeer payment service as an agent of an unaffiliated money transmitter precash but venmo is also licensed as a money transmitter in california has applied for a license in hawaii and may need to obtain additional state licenses as licensed money transmitters paypal and venmo are subject to restrictions on its investment of customer funds reporting requirements bonding requirements and inspection by state regulatory agencies if paypal or venmo were found to be in violation of money services laws or regulations paypal or venmo could be subject to liability andor additional restrictions forced to cease doing business with residents of certain states forced to change its business practices or required to obtain additional licenses or regulatory approvals that could impose a substantial cost on paypal or venmo any change to paypals business practices that makes the service less attractive to customers or prohibits its use by residents of a particular jurisdiction could also decrease the velocity of trade on ebay and websites operated by enterprise clients that accept paypal as a form of payment which would further harm our business in 2012 paypals california regulator the division of financial institutions under the california department of business oversight notified paypal that paypals practice of holding the funds underlying us customer balances as an agent on behalf of its customers rather than as owner of those funds meant that paypal could not treat those funds as liquid assets for purposes of the liquidity rules applicable to california money transmitter licensees based on changes to our us paypal user agreement effective november 2012 paypal began holding us customer balances as direct claims against paypal rather than as an agent or custodian on behalf of such paypal customers as a result effective november 2012 all us paypal customer balances which were previously reported as offbalance sheet have been reflected as assets in our consolidated balance sheet under funds receivable and customer accounts with an associated liability under funds payable and amounts due to customers in addition this change disqualified the customer balances from passthrough fdic insurance and resulted in us paypal customers becoming general creditors of paypal with respect to such customer balances this change could also result in decreased revenue to paypal as it has shifted some of the funds from interestbearing bank deposit accounts to government securities that could bear lower interest rates in markets other than the us the eu australia canada brazil and russia paypal serves its customers through paypal pte ltd a whollyowned subsidiary of paypal that is based in singapore paypal pte ltd is supervised in singapore as a holder of a stored value facility as paypal pte ltd is supervised as a holder of a stored value facility and does not hold a remittance license paypal pte ltd is not able to offer remittance payments including donations to charities in singapore and can only offer payments for the purchase of goods and services in many of the markets other than singapore served by paypal pte ltd it is not clear whether paypals singaporebased service is subject only to singaporean law or if it is subject to local laws whether such local laws would require a payment processor like paypal to be licensed as a bank or financial institution or otherwise in such markets paypal may rely on partnerships with local banks to process payments and conduct foreign exchange in local currency local regulators who do not have direct jurisdiction over singaporebased paypal pte ltd may use their local regulatory power to slow or halt payments to local merchants conducted through paypals local banking partner such regulatory actions impacting local banking partner arrangements could impose substantial costs and involve considerable delay to the provision or development of paypal services in a given market or could prevent paypal from providing any services in a given market for example in january 2010 the reserve bank of india directed the indian affiliate of paypals processing bank to suspend withdrawals to the indian bank accounts of paypal customers for both personal and business customers for a period of time as a result paypal ended personal noncommercial payments to and from indian accounts and the ability of indian sellers to spend payments they received and also stopped offering certain commercial payments between indian buyers and indian sellers in november 2010 the reserve bank of india issued guidelines to indian banks on the requirements for processing exportrelated transactions for online payment gateway service providers such as paypal including a limitation on the amount of individual transactions to no 17more than 500 subsequently increased to 3000 in october 2011 and to 10000 in june 2013 the reserve bank has also approved an application by paypals processing bank in india which would permit paypal to process domestic indian transactions subject to the domestic payment intermediary directions issued by the reserve bank and other conditions the reserve bank may again impose a suspension if it is not satisfied with paypals and its partner banks actions to comply with these guidelines in the event of any noncompliance paypal could be subject to fines from the reserve bank and paypals prospects for future business in india both crossborder and domestic could be materially and adversely affected in taiwan changes to foreign exchange regulations have required paypal to change its processes in order to continue offering taiwanese merchants the ability to receive payments in nontaiwanese currency and withdraw those payments to their taiwanese bank in taiwanese currency as a result paypal has set up a subsidiary in taiwan to apply for taiwanese certification which would enable paypal to declare foreign exchange transactions on behalf of taiwanese merchantseven if paypal is not currently required to be licensed in some jurisdictions future localization or targeted marketing of paypals service or expansion of the financial products offered by paypal in those countries whether alone or through a commercial alliance joint venture or an acquisition could subject paypal to additional licensure requirements laws and regulations and increased regulatory scrutiny even if paypal does not expand its services in the countries it currently serves changes in the laws of those countries could also require us to obtain new licenses or submit new registrations for example paypal has applied for and received a license in the canadian province of quebec has begun the process of acquiring a license in brazil and expects that new laws or regulations may require license applications in the near future in turkey china and hong kong there can be no assurance that paypal will be able to obtain any such licenses even if paypal were able to obtain such licenses there are substantial costs and potential product changes involved in maintaining such licenses and paypal would be subject to fines or other enforcement action if it violates disclosure reporting antimoney laundering capitalization corporate governance or other requirements of such licenses these factors could impose substantial additional costs and involve considerable delay to the development or provision of paypals products in certain countries delay or failure to receive such a license or regulatory approval could require paypal to change its business practices or features in ways that would adversely affect paypals expansion plans or force paypal to suspend providing products and services to customers in one or more countries although we do not originate loans under the bill me later service we do purchase receivables related to the consumer loans extended by the bank which originates them one or more jurisdictions may conclude that the ebay company which purchases those receivables is a lender money transmitter or loan broker or is otherwise subject to licensure or regulatory approval which could subject us to liability or regulation in such jurisdictions as described under the caption bill me laters operations depend on lending services provided by unaffiliated lenders above a lawsuit pending against bill me later in the us district court for the district of utah alleges that in its relationship with the former issuer of the bill me later credit products bill me later was acting as the true lender to customers in violation of various california laws including the states usury law additionally federal regulators could mandate changes to the relationship between us and the issuing banks of the bill me later credit products any termination or interruption of the issuing banks lending services to consumers could result in an interruption of bill me later services as described above under the caption bill me laters operations depend on lending services provided by unaffiliated lenders our payments business is subject to antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulationsour payments business is also subject to various antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations around the world that prohibit among other things its involvement in transferring the proceeds of criminal activities paypal is focused on compliance with these laws and regulations and has programs designed to comply with new and existing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing legal and regulatory requirements however any errors failures or delays in complying with federal state or foreign antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions any new antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations or changes to or expansion of the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations applicable to our payments business could subject us to additional laws and regulations additional licensure requirements and increased regulatory scrutiny which could force us to change our business practices or limit our ability to grow our business costs associated with fines or enforcement actions changes in our compliance requirements or limitations on our ability to grow our business could have an adverse effect on our financial results and harm our payments businessin the us paypal is subject to regulations that require it to report within required timeframes suspicious activities involving transactions of 2000 or more and may be required to obtain and keep more detailed records on the senders and recipients in certain transfers of 3000 or more in addition regulations governing prepaid access programs which took full effect in march 2012 require paypal to take additional steps to verify the identity of customers who prefund a paypal balance 18us regulators have increased their scrutiny of compliance with these obligations new and existing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing regulations may require paypal to further revise or expand its compliance program including the procedures it uses to verify the identity of its customers and to monitor international and domestic transactionsseveral countries in which paypal is regulated including australia japan luxembourg and singapore have implemented new antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing laws and regulations and paypal has had to make changes to its compliance program in response in november 2009 the australian antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing regulator austrac accepted an enforceable undertaking from paypal australia pursuant to which paypal australia agreed among other things to appoint an independent auditor to assess paypal australias antimoney laundering compliance policies and procedures and issue a report identifying any unremediated deficiencies accompanied by a plan by paypal to remedy any such deficiencies pursuant to the remediation plan submitted by paypal australia and accepted by austrac paypal australia was required to invest in significant improvements to its antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing systems policies and operations austrac formally notified paypal of the completion of the enforceable undertaking in early 2013 as paypal continues to localize its services in additional jurisdictions it could be required to meet standards similar to or more burdensome than those in australia in june 2013 the monetary authority of singapore mas requested that paypal submit a global antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing risk assessment report risk report after the submission of the risk report the mas requested that paypal submit a global antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing risk management proposal proposal paypal must submit the proposal by the end of march 2014 the mas could require modifications to paypals existing compliance program as a condition of approving a proposal the european commission has also announced a consultation process to consider revisions to the european antimoney laundering directive these requirements together with any new requirements or changes to existing requirements could impose significant costs on paypal result in delays to planned product improvements make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the attractiveness of its products our payments business is subject to consumer protection laws and regulations our payments business is subject to consumer protection laws and regulations in the us and other countries in which it operates paypal is focused on compliance with these laws and regulations and has programs designed to comply with new and existing consumer protection requirements however any errors failures or delays in complying with such consumer protection laws and regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits penalties forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions any new consumer protection laws and regulations or changes to or expansion of the interpretation or application of existing laws and regulations applicable to our payments business could subject us to additional laws and regulations additional licensure requirements and increased regulatory scrutiny which could force us to change our business practices or limit our ability to grow our business costs associated with fines or enforcement actions changes in our compliance requirements or limitations on our ability to grow our business could have an adverse effect on our financial results and harm our payments business although there have been no definitive interpretations to date paypal has taken actions as though its service is subject to the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e of the us federal reserve board under such regulations among other things paypal is required to provide advance disclosure of changes to its service to follow specified error resolution procedures and to reimburse consumers for losses from certain transactions not authorized by the consumer paypal seeks to pass most of these losses on to the relevant merchants but paypal incurs losses if the merchant does not have sufficient funds in its paypal account additionally even technical violations of these laws can result in penalties of up to 1000 for each noncompliant transaction or up to 500000 per violation in any class action and we could also be liable for plaintiffs attorneys fees in the second quarter of 2010 two putative classaction lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v paypal inc and moises zepeda v paypal inc were filed in the us district court for the northern district of california these lawsuits contain allegations related to violations of aspects of the electronic fund transfer act and regulation e and violations of a previous settlement agreement related to regulation e andor allege that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited users accounts these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypals practices among other remedies a determination that there have been violations of the electronic fund transfer act regulation e or violations of other laws relating to paypals practices could expose paypal to significant liability a lawsuit that has been filed by a consumer association in germany also addresses paypals practices to hold users funds and aims at more transparency in the terms and conditions towards consumers as to when a user can expect paypal to impose account limitations any changes to paypals practices resulting from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend substantial resources which could delay other planned product launches or improvements and further harm our business in january 2012 the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb finalized new rules under regulation e mandated by the doddfrank act which requires paypal starting in late october 2013 to provide additional disclosures error resolution 19rights and cancellation rights to us consumers who make international remittance payments these remittance transfer rule requirements could increase our costs of processing international payments and adversely affect our business in january 2014 the cfpb proposed a regulation that would allow it to supervise all companies including paypal that provide more than one million international money transfers per year under the proposal cfpb examiners would be able to examine paypal for compliance with the remittance transfer ruleon august 7 2013 and january 13 2014 we received civil investigative demands cids from the cfpb requesting that we provide testimony produce documents and provide information relating primarily to the acquisition management and operation of the bill me later business including online credit products and services advertising loan origination customer acquisition servicing debt collection and complaints handling practices we are cooperating with the cfpb in connection with the cidschanges to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our payments business paypal does not directly access payment card networks such as visa and mastercard which enable paypals acceptance of credit cards and debit cards including some types of prepaid cards as a result paypal must rely on banks or other payment processors to process transactions and must pay fees for this service from time to time payment card networks have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction using one of their cards for example mastercard has recently announced a new staged digital wallet operator annual network access fee which would apply to many of paypals transactions if the buyer uses a mastercard to fund their payment the fee for 2013 was collected from paypal in june 2013 paypals payment card processors have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to paypal as well as increase their own fees for processing changes in interchange fees and assessments could increase paypals operating costs and reduce its profit margins in addition in some jurisdictions governments have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fees or have opened investigations as to whether visa or mastercards interchange fees and practices violate antitrust law in the us the doddfrank act enacted in 2010 authorizes the federal reserve board to regulate debit card interchange rates and debit card network exclusivity provisions and in june 2011 the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees at significantly lower rates than visa or mastercard previously charged any material reduction in credit or debit card interchange rates in the us or other markets could jeopardize paypals competitive position against traditional credit and debit card processors although it would also lower paypals costs while the regulations adopted by the federal reserve board in june 2011 do not treat paypal as a payment card network future changes to those regulations or to paypals business could potentially cause paypal to be treated as a payment card network which could subject paypal to additional regulation and require paypal to change its business practices which could reduce paypals revenue and adversely affect paypals businesspaypal is required by its processors to comply with payment card network operating rules and paypal has agreed to reimburse its processors for any fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by paypal or paypals customers the payment card networks set and interpret the card rules payment card networks have from time to time alleged that various aspects of paypals business model violate these operating rules such allegations have recently been made more aggressively and if not resolved could result in material fines and penalties or require changes in paypals business that may be costly make it less attractive to customers or even require paypal to cease certain operations the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or reinterpret existing rules that paypal or its processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement as a result paypal could lose its ability to give customers the option of using payment cards to fund their payments or could lose its ability to give customers the choice of currency in which they would like their card to be charged which would reduce paypals revenues from crossborder trade if paypal were unable to accept payment cards its business would be seriously damaged in addition the velocity of trade on ebay and websites operated by enterprise clients that accept paypal as a form of payment could decrease and our business would further suffer paypal is also required to comply with payment card networks special operating rules for payment service providers to merchants paypal and its payment card processors have implemented specific business processes for merchant customers in order to comply with these rules but any failure to comply could result in fines the amount of which would be within the payment card networks discretion paypal also could be subject to fines from payment card networks if it fails to detect that merchants are engaging in activities that are illegal or that are considered high risk primarily the sale of certain types of digital content for high risk merchants paypal must either prevent such merchants from using paypal or register such merchants with payment card networks and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchants paypal has incurred fines from its payment card processors relating to paypals failure to detect the use of its service by illegal or high risk merchants the amount of these fines has not been material but any additional fines in the future would likely be for larger amounts could become material and could result in a termination of paypals ability to accept payment cards or changes in paypals process for registering new customers which would significantly damage paypals business paypals new retail point20ofsale solution and paypal here product are also subject to payment card network operating rules which may increase the costs of those products or otherwise negatively impact their deployment particularly internationallysimilarly consumers of the websites operated by enterprise clients typically pay for purchases by payment card or similar payment method accordingly our enterprise business faces risks similar to the risks described above for paypalthe listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners included pirated or counterfeit items may harm our business we have received in the past and we anticipate receiving in the future communications alleging that certain items listed or sold through our services by our users infringe thirdparty copyrights trademarks and trade names or other intellectual property rights see item 3 legal proceedings below there are over 40000 rights owners in our verified rights owner vero program and each rights owner has anywhere from one to several hundred brands although we have sought to work actively with the owners of intellectual property rights to eliminate listings offering infringing items on our websites and mobile platforms some rights owners have expressed the view that our efforts are insufficient allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights have resulted in threatened and actual litigation against us from time to time by rights owners including litigation brought by luxury brand owners such as tiffany amp co in the us rolex sa and coty prestige lancaster group gmbh in germany louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture in france and loréal sa lancôme parfums et beauté amp cie and laboratoire garnier amp cie in several european countries the plaintiffs in these cases seek or sought to hold ebay liable for alleged counterfeit items listed on our websites by third parties for tester and other consumer products labeled in a manner to prevent resale and for unboxed and other allegedly nonconforming products in each case listed on our websites by third parties for the alleged misuse of trademarks or copyrights in listings or otherwise on our websites and in connection with paid search advertisements for alleged violations of selective distribution channel laws or parallel import laws for listings of authentic items and for alleged noncompliance with consumer protection laws plaintiffs in these and similar suits seek among other remedies injunctive relief and damages statutory damages for copyright or trademark violations could range up to 150000 per copyright violation and 2000000 per trademark violation in the us and may be even higher in other jurisdictions these and similar suits may also force us to modify our business practices for example in june 2013 the german federal supreme court partially confirmed a decision by the hamburg court of appeal in a matter where we had been found liable to prevent infringing childrens chairs from appearing on the site and ruled that as a result of keyword advertising that linked to search result lists we were required to increase efforts to ensure that those search results were free from infringing content upon initial notification of such content this decision may require us to change our business practices in germany in a manner that increases our costs and lowers our revenue in addition rights owners have aggressively sought to reduce the applicability of limitations to intellectual property rights such as copyright exhaustion and the first sale doctrine in cases such as vernor v autodesk inc ninth circuit court of appeals and wiley v kirtsaeng us supreme court although the us supreme courts ruling in wiley v kirtsaeng overturned the second circuit court of appeals ruling and established that the first sale doctrine applies in the us to products lawfully made outside the us some rights owners oppose that reasoning and have expressed support for a legislative change to the us copyright act to the extent the scope or applicability of such doctrines is limited or narrowed the supply of goods available for resale on our websites and mobile platforms may be adversely affected in the aggregate these and similar suits may force us to modify our business practices which could lower our revenue increase our costs or make our websites and mobile platforms less convenient to our customers or result in significant damage awards and injunctions which could materially harm our business in addition to litigation from rights owners we may be subject to regulatory civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided and abetted in the sale of counterfeit goods while we have had some early success in defending against such litigation more recent cases have been based at least in part on different legal theories than those of earlier cases and there is no guarantee that we will continue to be successful in defending against such litigation plaintiffs in recent cases have argued that we are not entitled to safe harbors under the digital millennium copyright act in the us or as a hosting provider in the european union under the electronic commerce directive because of the alleged active nature of our involvement with our sellers and that whether or not such safe harbors are available we should be found liable because we supposedly have not adequately removed listings that are counterfeit or are authentic but allegedly violate trademark or copyright law or effectively suspended users who have created such listings while we do not believe the european court of justice decision in the loréal case see item 3 legal proceedings below changes the standard for hosting immunity under the electronic commerce directive rights owners in european jurisdictions have asserted that our degree of participation in the transaction should cause us to be unable to take advantage of the hosting immunity exception final resolution of this issue has been left to the national courts of member countries in the european union we believe that 21the legal climate especially in europe is becoming more adverse to our positions which may require us to take actions which could lower our revenues increase our costs or make our websites and mobile platforms less convenient to our customers which could materially harm our business in certain emerging markets the government may be less experienced in dealing with online or mobile commerce andor hosting immunity protections may be more limited or not available at all in addition public perception that counterfeit or pirated items are commonplace on our websites even if factually incorrect would damage our reputation lower the price our sellers receive for their items and damage our business we are continuously seeking to improve and modify our efforts to eliminate counterfeit and pirated items through ongoing business initiatives designed to reduce bad buyer experiences and improve customer satisfaction and by responding to new patterns we are seeing among counterfeiters and others committing fraud on our users increased intermediation of transactions between buyers and sellers which we generally refer to as our managed marketplace initiatives intended to achieve those goals may result in us being unable to rely to the same extent that we have in the past on hosting immunity and other secondary liability safe harbors when sued by users and rights owners over actions taken on our site by our users while we are taking steps to mitigate the potential impact on our safe harbor defenses we may be subject to more intellectual property litigation and may lose more cases as a result of these business model changes which would adversely affect our business and results of operationscontent owners and other intellectual property rights owners may also seek to bring legal action against entities that are peripherally involved in the sale of infringing items such as payment companies to the extent that intellectual property rights owners bring legal action against paypal based upon the use of paypals payment services in a transaction involving the sale of infringing items including on our websites or mobile platforms our business could be harmed several jurisdictions have adopted new laws in these areas and others are considering imposing additional restrictions in addition new laws have been proposed regulating ecommerce companies with respect to intellectual property issues for example acta and tpp are trade agreements that include international standards for enforcing intellectual property rights including provisions regarding counterfeit goods and online piracy the european commission is considering revising the intellectual property enforcement directive which could potentially increase our exposure to enforcement actions from rights owners implementation of these or similar laws could require us to change our business practices increase our compliance costs and harm our business rights owners have also increasingly gone into us courts and obtained injunctions requiring paypal to cease handling transactions for named websites and third parties in most cases located outside the us and to hold the funds of such parties pending judicial resolution of such rights owners claims against such parties which disrupts the relationship between paypal and such parties and if such parties sell on our marketplaces platforms could also adversely affect our marketplaces business we are subject to patent litigation we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other parties patents we are a defendant in a number of patent suits and have been notified of several other potential patent disputes we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claims involving various aspects of our marketplaces payments and enterprise segments asour products and services continue to expand in scope and complexity eg our mobile local social and digital initiatives we expand into new businesses including through acquisitions and the universe of patent owners who may claim that we companies that we have acquired or our customers including paypal merchants and enterprise clients infringe their patents and the aggregate number of patents controlled by such patent owners correspondingly increases such claims may be brought directly against us any of our companies andor against our customers including paypal merchants and enterprise clients whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or as a business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claims against us and other technology companies have been and continue to be initiated by third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims in addition we have seen significant patent disputes between operating companies in some technology industries eg mobile telephony patent claims whether meritorious or not are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require us to make expensive changes in our methods of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements or cease conducting certain operations which would harm our business 22use of our services for illegal purposes could harm our business we may be unable to prevent our users from selling unlawful or stolen goods or unlawful services or selling goods or services in an unlawful manner as a result we including our employees and directors of our various entities have been and may continue to be subject to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our services in a number of circumstances third parties including government regulators and law enforcement officials have alleged that our services aid and abet certain violations of certain laws including antiscalping laws with respect to the resale of tickets laws regarding the sale of counterfeit items laws restricting or prohibiting the transferability and by extension the resale of digital goods eg event tickets books music and software the fencing of stolen goods selective distribution channel laws customs laws distance selling laws and the sale of items outside of the us that are regulated by us export controls for examplein turkey local prosecutors and courts are investigating our liability for allegedly illegal actions by users of our turkish marketplaces business gittigidiyor in accordance with local law and custom they are considering indicting and have in some cases already indicted one or more members of the board of directors of our local turkish subsidiary we intend to defend vigorously against any such actions in august 2012 we were informed that us listings of footwear with religious imagery were visible on our local indian site and we immediately removed these listings in september 2012 a criminal case was registered against us in india in regard to these listings and we are challenging the prosecution of this case the german federal supreme court has ruled that we may have a duty to take reasonable measures to prevent prohibited dvds from being sold on our site to minors and that competitors may be able to enforce this duty as we seek to reduce bad buying experiences and improve the customer experience on our sites our level of interaction with buyers and sellers may increase over time which could in turn increase our potential exposure to allegations of civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities carried out by users through our servicesalthough we have prohibited the listing of illegal and stolen goods and certain highrisk items and implemented other protective measures we may be required to spend substantial resources to take additional protective measures or discontinue certain service offerings in addition we may incur costs as a result of potential liability relating to the alleged or actual sale of unlawful goods or the unlawful sale of goods certain manufacturers and large retailers have sought new us federal and state legislation regarding stolen goods that could limit our ability to allow sellers to use our sites without confirming the source of and their legal rights to sell the underlying goods in addition from time to time we have received significant media attention relating to the listing or sale of illegal goods and stolen goods using our services this negative publicity could damage our reputation diminish the value of our brand names and make users reluctant to use our products and services paypals payment system is also susceptible to potentially illegal or improper uses including illegal online gambling fraudulent sales of goods or services illicit sales of prescription medications or controlled substances piracy of software movies music and other copyrighted or trademarked goods money laundering terrorist financing bank fraud child pornography trafficking prohibited sales of alcoholic beverages or tobacco products online securities fraud and encouraging promoting facilitating or instructing others to engage in illegal activities there has been an increased focus by rights owners and us government officials on the role that payments systems play in the sale of and payment for pirated digital goods on the internet primarily through file sharing services recent changes in law have increased the penalties for intermediaries providing payment services for certain illegal activities and additional paymentsrelated proposals are under active consideration by government policymakers despite measures paypal has taken to detect and lessen the risk of this kind of conduct illegal activities could still be funded using paypal any resulting claims could damage our reputation and any resulting liabilities loss of transaction volume or increased costs could harm our business and our financial results23if our enterprise business is unable to migrate certain existing clients to its new suite of commerce technologies in a timely and costeffective manner it would be substantially harmed our enterprise business is in the process of migrating certain existing clients to its new suite of commerce technologies this project is time consuming could involve additional costs and involves significant technical risk previously planned migrations of certain clients to the new suite of commerce technologies have been delayed into 2014 and beyond if client migrations to the new suite of commerce technologies continue to be delayed the functionality of the new suite of commerce technologies is not accepted by existing enterprise clients or prospective clients targeted by our enterprise business the new suite of commerce technologies contains an unacceptable amount of design flaws or does not perform or operate as expected or our enterprise business fails to meet client commitments and services level agreements our enterprise business could continue to be subject to substantial penalties under its agreements with its clients including significant financial penalties and termination rights for its affected clients its relationships with its clients and their respective businesses could continue to be substantially harmed and additional enterprise clients may seek to terminate their contracts with our enterprise business early based on actual or proposed breach in addition our enterprise business new suite of commerce technologies provides for substantially more client control over certain platform functionality such as promotions and marketing operations and performance analytics if our enterprise business is unable to help clients understand assess and address their internal preparedness needs for the new suite of commerce technologies this could result in delays in deployment client dissatisfaction due to lack of preparedness degraded site performance and additional support costs attributable to clientbased issues we believe that our enterprise business ability to secure new clients and retain current clients will be negatively impacted if it is unable to continue to roll out the new suite of commerce technologies in live client implementations any of these events or circumstances could materially and adversely affect our enterprise business even if accomplished successfully this migration project may cost more than expected or take longer than planned which could harm our enterprise business we are subject to risks associated with information disseminated through our service the laws relating to the liability of online services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their services remain unsettled in many jurisdictions claims could be made against online services companies under both us and foreign law for defamation libel invasion of privacy negligence copyright or trademark infringement or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials disseminated through their services several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability under a number of these theories have been brought against us as well as other online service companies in addition domestic and foreign legislation has been proposed that would prohibit or impose liability for the transmission over the internet of certain types of information our marketplaces service features a feedback forum which includes information from users regarding other users although all such feedback is generated by users and not by us claims of defamation or other injury have been made in the past and could be made in the future against us for not removing content posted in the feedback forum furthermore several court decisions arguably have narrowed the scope of the immunity provided to online service providers like us in the us under the communications decency act for example the ninth circuit has held that certain immunity provisions under the communications decency act might not apply to the extent that a website owner materially contributes to the development of unlawful content on its website as our websites add or change services challenges to the applicability of these immunities can be expected to continue in addition the paris court of appeal has ruled in the louis vuitton malletier and christian dior couture cases that applicable laws protecting passive internet hosts from liability are inapplicable to ebay given that ebay actively promotes bidding on its sellers listings and receives a commission on successful transactions and is therefore a broker the european court of justice decision in the loréal case see item 3 legal proceedings below gave broad discretion to national courts in europe to determine if internet hosting immunity applies to ebay accordingly our potential liability to third parties for the userprovided content on our sites particularly in jurisdictions outside the us where laws governing internet transactions are unsettled may increase if we become liable for information provided by our users and carried on our service in any jurisdiction in which we operate we could be directly harmed and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability including expending substantial resources or discontinuing certain service offerings which would negatively affect our financial results the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could require us to incur additional costs and harm our reputation and our business24government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties a large number of transactions occur on our websites and mobile platforms on a daily basis government regulators have received a significant number of consumer complaints about our marketplaces payments and enterprise businesses which while small as a percentage of our total transactions are large in aggregate numbers as a result from time to time we have been contacted by various us and foreign governmental regulatory agencies that have questions about our operations and the steps we take to protect our users from fraud paypal has received inquiries regarding its restriction and disclosure practices from the federal trade commission and regarding these and other business practices from the attorneys general of a number of states in september 2006 paypal entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of a number of states under which it agreed to pay 17 million to the attorneys general shorten and streamline its user agreement increase educational messaging to users about funding choices and communicate more information regarding protection programs to users from time to time we face inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to actions that we have taken that are designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites and we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future for example in 2008 the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods from time to time other regulators have requested information concerning paypals limitations of customer accounts similarly from time to time bill me later has received customer complaints that could result in investigations into bill me laters business practices by state or federal regulators as a result of the us credit crisis new laws and regulations have been and are expected to be adopted and implemented that impose additional obligations and restrictions on the provision of credit on august 7 2013 and january 13 2014 we received civil investigative demands cids from the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb requesting that we provide testimony produce documents and provide information relating primarily to the acquisition management and operation of the bill me later business including online credit products and services advertising loan origination customer acquisition servicing debt collection and complaints handling practices we are cooperating with the cfpb in connection with the cids we are likely to receive additional inquiries from regulatory agencies in the future including under new or existing credit laws or regulations relating to our business products and services we have responded to all inquiries from regulatory agencies by describing our current and planned antifraud efforts customer support procedures operating procedures and disclosures of the relevant business if one or more of these agencies is not satisfied with our response to current or future inquiries we could be subject to enforcement actions fines or other penalties or forced to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business one or more of these agencies also might take action against other companies with similar businesses which could force us to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business we are subject to general litigation and regulatory disputes from time to time we are involved in other disputes or regulatory inquiries that arise in the ordinary course of business these disputes and inquiries include lawsuits by our users individually or as class actions alleging among other things improper credit andor collection activities improper disclosure of our prices rules or policies that our prices rules policies or customeruser agreements violate applicable law that we have not acted in conformity with such prices rules policies or agreements or violations of privacy laws and policies including violations of the telephone consumer protection act 47 usc section 227 et seq tcpa as discussed in more detail under the captions changes in regulations regulatory scrutiny or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business and our payments business is subject to consumer protection laws and regulations the number and significance of these disputes and inquiries continue to increase as our company has grown larger our businesses have expanded in scope eg our mobile local social and digital initiatives and our continuing geographical expansion and our products and services have increased in complexity we have in the past been forced to litigate such claims we may also become more vulnerable to thirdparty claims as laws such as the digital millennium copyright act the lanham act and the communications decency act are interpreted by the courts as our products and services to users continue to expand and as we expand geographically into jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to the potential liability of online intermediaries such as ourselves are either unclear or less favorable as discussed in more detail under the caption new and existing regulations could harm our business as an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile we may be subject to additional laws and regulations which may have significant penalties in addition we are also subject to federal state local and foreign laws of general applicability including laws regulating working conditions similar to several other technology companies the us department of justice doj and the state of california allege that we violated us and california antitrust law by agreeing not to recruit employees from other technology companies we 25filed a motion to dismiss the cases asserted against us and in september 2013 the us district court for the northern district of california granted the motion to dismiss regarding the california asserted case but denied the motion to dismiss regarding the doj asserted case the state of california has filed an amended complaint which we have moved to dismiss these cases are currently stayed we believe these allegations are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously these claims and any other claims or regulatory actions against us whether meritorious or not could be time consuming result in costly litigation damage awards including statutory damages for certain causes of action in certain jurisdictions injunctive relief or increased costs of doing business through adverse judgment or settlement require us to change our business practices in expensive ways require significant amounts of management time result in the diversion of significant operational resources or otherwise harm our business changes to our programs to protect buyers and sellers could increase our costs and loss rate our ebay and paypal buyer protection programs represent the means by which we compensate users who believe that they have been defrauded have not received the item that they purchased or have received an item different than what was described however users who pay through paypal may have reimbursement rights from their payment card company or bank which in turn will seek recovery from paypal ebay also periodically receives complaints from buyers as to the quality of the goods purchased we expect to continue to receive communications from users requesting reimbursement or threatening or commencing legal action against us if no reimbursement is made our liability for these sort of claims is slowly beginning to be clarified in some jurisdictions and may be higher in some nonus jurisdictions than it is in the us litigation involving liability for thirdparty actions could be costly and time consuming for us divert management attention result in increased costs of doing business lead to adverse judgments or otherwise harm our business in addition affected users will likely complain to regulatory agencies that could take action against us including imposing fines or seeking injunctions over the last several years we have enhanced the buyer and seller protections offered by paypal in certain ebay marketplaces and in certain countries for transactions outside of ebay marketplaces in october 2013 paypal launched and expanded its seller protection to eligible merchants in the asia pacific region these changes to paypals buyer and seller protection program could result in future changes and fluctuations in our payments transaction loss rate for the year ended december 31 2013 our payments transaction losses including both direct losses and buyer protection payouts totaled 369 million representing 021 of our net total payment volume respectively beginning in 2009 we have also changed the dispute resolution process for transactions for buyers in the us uk and germany on ebaycom ebaycouk and ebayde respectively as described in more detail above under the caption changes to our dispute resolution process could increase our costs and loss rate which could result in an increase in our combined ebay and paypal transaction losses beginning in 2009 we have transitioned buyers in the us uk and germany to a dispute resolution process or resolutions provided by ebay customer support which now serves as the primary entry point for buyers in these countries if they are unable to resolve their disputes with ebay sellers among other things the resolutions process provides that ebay will generally reimburse the buyer for the full amount of an items purchase price including original shipping costs in cases where the item was not received or the item they received was different from that described in the listing and the seller does not provide adequate resolution to the buyer ebay then attempts to recoup amounts paid to the buyer from the sellers paypal accounts or through other collection methods we have recently simplified the process for filing a resolutions case which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of cases being opened our costs associated with resolutions have increased as a result of these changes to our resolutions policies and process in part because ebay may not have the same level of rights of recoupment against sellers as paypal resulting in higher costs to operate the program these changes together with any additional changes that we may make to our resolutions process in the future may be negatively received by and lead to dissatisfaction on the part of some of our sellers and may also result in an increase in buyer fraud and associated transaction losses increased costs loss rates or liabilities resulting from ebay andor paypals current buyer and seller protection programs or changes to such buyer and seller protection programs could have an adverse effect on our business and financial resultsfailure to deal effectively with fraud bad transactions and negative customer experiences would increase our loss rate and harm our business paypals highly automated and liquid payment service makes paypal an attractive target for fraud in configuring its service paypal continually strives to maintain the right balance of appropriate measures to promote both convenience and security for customers identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen payment card or bank account numbers can potentially steal large amounts of money from businesses such as paypal we believe that several of paypals current and former competitors in the electronic payments business have gone out of business or significantly restricted their businesses largely due to losses from this type of fraud while paypal uses advanced antifraud technologies we expect that technically 26knowledgeable criminals will continue to attempt to circumvent paypals antifraud systems using increasingly sophisticated methods from time to time such fraudsters may discover and exploit vulnerabilities that may not immediately be identified and remediated which may in turn result in onetime increases in fraud and associated transaction losses which may be substantial in addition because users frequently use the same passwords for different sites a data breach of a third party site can result in a spike in ebay andor paypal transaction losses paypals service could also be subject to employee fraud or other internal security breaches and paypal may be required to reimburse customers for any funds stolen as a result of such breaches merchants could also request reimbursement or stop using paypal if they are affected by buyer fraud or other types of fraud additional fraud risks associated with paypals point of sale solutions are described below under the caption paypals retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional risks paypal incurs substantial losses due to claims from buyers that merchants have not performed or that their goods or services do not match the merchants description whether those claims arise from merchant fraud or from an unintentional failure to perform by the merchant paypal seeks to recover such losses from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay paypal also incurs losses from claims that the customer did not authorize the purchase from buyer fraud from erroneous transmissions and from customers who have closed bank accounts or have insufficient funds in them to satisfy payments in addition if losses incurred by paypal related to payment card transactions become excessive they could potentially result in paypal losing the right to accept payment cards for payment which would materially and adversely affect paypals business both on and off ebay in the event that paypal was unable to accept payment cards the velocity of trade on ebay and off ebay ie other websites that accept paypal as a form of payment could also decrease in which case our business would further suffer the bill me later service is similarly subject to the risk of fraudulent activity associated with merchants users of the bill me later service and third parties handling its user information our payments business has taken measures to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measures need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving forms of fraud or in connection with new product offerings if these measures do not succeed our business will suffer ebay faces similar risks with respect to fraudulent activities on its websites ebay periodically receives complaints from users who may not have received the goods that they had purchased in some cases individuals have been arrested and convicted for fraudulent activities using our websites ebay also receives complaints from sellers who have not received payment for the goods that a buyer had contracted to purchase nonpayment may occur because of miscommunication because a buyer has changed his or her mind and decided not to honor the contract to purchase the item or because the buyer bid on the item maliciously to harm either the seller or ebay in some european and asian jurisdictions buyers may also have the right to withdraw from a sale made by a professional seller within a specified time period while ebay can in some cases suspend the accounts of users who fail to fulfill their payment or delivery obligations to other users ebay does not have the ability to require users to make payment or deliver goods or otherwise make users whole other than through its buyer protection program negative publicity and user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by users of our marketplaces payments and enterprise services could reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand names we believe that negative user experiences are one of the primary reasons users stop using our services in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of a merchant that sells goods or services in advance of the date of their delivery or use eg airline cruise or concert tickets custommade goods and subscriptions ebay andor paypal could be liable to the buyers of such goods or services either through its buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment cards used by customers to fund their payment through paypal while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may be insufficientfrom time to time we have considered more active mechanisms designed to combat bad buyer experiences and increase buyer satisfaction including evaluating sellers on the basis of their transaction history and restricting or suspending their activity as a result for example in the us the uk and canada we may request that paypal hold seller funds in certain instances eg for sellers with a limited selling history or belowstandard performance ratings which is intended to help improve seller performance and increase buyer satisfaction we may expand the scope of such programs in the future and introduce other programs with similar aims in these and other countries our increased usage of these or other mechanisms to attempt to improve buyer satisfaction could result in dissatisfaction on the part of sellers loss of share to competing marketplaces reduced selection of inventory on our sites increased loss rates and other adverse effects 27any factors that reduce crossborder trade could harm our business crossborder trade has become an increasingly important source of both revenue and profits for us crossborder transactions using our websites and mobile platforms generally provide higher revenues and gross margins than similar transactions that take place within a single country or market we generally earn higher transaction fees for crossborder transactions involving paypal and our marketplaces business continues to represent a relatively straightforward way for buyers and sellers to engage in crossborder trade compared with other alternatives crossborder trade also represents our primary or in some cases only presence in certain markets in which internet and mobile device use is accelerating and we have a limited or no domestic marketplaces business such as brazillatin america china russia and various other countriesthe interpretation and application of specific national or regional laws such as those related to intellectual property rights of authentic products selective distribution networks and sellers in other countries listing items on the internet and the potential interpretation and application of laws of multiple jurisdictions eg the jurisdiction of the buyer the seller andor the location of the item being sold are extremely complicated in the context of crossborder trade some of these issues are involved in the loréal and louis vuitton malletier cases see item 3 legal proceedings below the interpretation andor application of such laws could impose restrictions on or increase the costs of purchasing selling shipping or returning goods across national borders in addition our crossborder trade is also subject to and may be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro the british pound the australian dollar or other currencies crossborder trade related to purchases of dollardenominated goods or goods from those asiapacific countries whose currencies tend to follow the dollar by nonus purchasers will likely decrease and that decrease will likely not be offset by a corresponding increase in crossborder trade involving purchases by us buyers of goods denominated in other currencies even if crossborder trade is not reduced if more sellers who accept paypal begin to offer their goods or services in multiple currencies and to arrange for withdrawal of balances to local bank accounts in multiple countries this could reduce paypals revenues from foreign exchange fees in addition to the risks above any other factors that increase the costs of purchasing selling shipping or returning goods across national borders or restrict delay or make crossborder trade more difficult or impractical including fluctuations in currency exchange rates currency restrictions increases in postal or delivery service rates postal or delivery service terminations disruptions or interruptions changes in the business practices of the card networks or participating banks concerning dynamic currency conversion import or export control laws the application of or increases in tariffs duties or other taxes on imports or exports customs enforcement including delays at the border attributable to customs inspections enforcement of international intellectual property rights by rights holders or court rulings or that otherwise result in a net reduction in crossborder trade on our websites and mobile platforms would lower our revenues and profits and adversely affect our business as part of our ongoing efforts to drive more transactions and improve seller efficiency and buyer experience and trust we are evaluating opportunities to become more actively involved in different aspects of crossborder transactions which could potentially expose us to additional liability based upon the nature of our involvement in aspects of such transactions andor the actions of our users in one or more countries our business is subject to online security risks including security breaches our businesses involve the storage and transmission of users proprietary information in addition a significant number of our users authorize us to bill their payment card accounts directly for all transaction and other fees charged by us for example paypals users routinely provide payment card and other financial information and enterprise customers routinely provide payment card information and other personally identifiable information which we maintain to facilitate the ease of future transactions we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication to effectively secure transmission of confidential information including customer payment card numbers however such technology may not be sufficient to protect the transmission of our confidential information in addition advances in computer capabilities new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction data being breached or compromised an increasing number of websites including those owned by several other large internet and offline companies have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means for example actions by a suborned employee our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses physical or electronic 28breakins and similar disruptions and we have experienced denialofservice type attacks on our system that have in certain instances made all or portions of our websites unavailable for periods of time for example in december 2010 paypal was subject to a series of distributed denial of service attacks following paypals decision to indefinitely restrict the account used by wikileaks due to an alleged violation of paypals acceptable use policy a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate our or our users proprietary information cause interruption in our operations damage our computers or those of our users or otherwise damage our reputation in addition our users as well as those of other prominent internet companies have been and will continue to be targeted by parties using fraudulent spoof and phishing emails to misappropriate user names passwords payment card numbers or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through trojan horse programs to our users computers these emails appear to be legitimate emails sent by ebay paypal stubhub one of our other businesses a user of one of our businesses or an enterprise client but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information through email or download malware despite our efforts to mitigate spoof and phishing emails through product improvements and user education spoof and phishing activities remain a serious problem if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs public perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed resulting in damage to our reputation and we could lose users also any compromise of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and expose us to significant legal and financial exposure  enterprise clients also face similar risks of security breaches and to the extent that such clients are harmed as a result of a security breach our enterprise business would also be adversely affected in addition under payment card rules and our contracts with our card processors if there is a breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by paypals direct payment card processing customers we could be liable to the payment card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses if we were unable to accept payment cards our businesses would be seriously damaged further we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches these issues are likely to become more difficult and costly as we expand the number of places where we operate financial services regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the eu have implemented or are considering proposals to impose new authentication requirements on banks and payment processors intended to reduce online fraud eg twofactor authentication to verify a users identity which could impose significant costs on paypal require paypal to change its business practices make it more difficult for new customers to join its network and reduce the ease of use of its products which could harm paypals business our insurance policies carry low coverage limits which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breacheschanges in regulations regulatory scrutiny or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business we are subject to laws relating to the collection use retention security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our users around the world much of the personal information that we collect especially financial information is regulated by multiple laws the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are in a state of flux and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country in many cases these laws apply not only to thirdparty transactions but also to transfers of information between or among ourselves our subsidiaries and other parties with which we have commercial relations in particular the collection and use of personal information by companies has come under increased regulatory scrutiny further these laws continue to develop in ways we cannot predict and which may adversely impact our business regulatory scrutiny of privacy and user data protection is increasing on a global basis we are subject to a number of local privacy laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate including the following and any many of those jurisdictions are proactively evaluating changes to those laws and regulationsas an entity licensed and subject to regulation as a bank in luxembourg paypal europe sà rl et cie sca is subject to banking secrecy lawsthe european union has proposed a general data protection regulation that would supersede the european data protection directive changes could increase penalties and fines for failing to comply with the new regulation and it is unclear how it consistently the new regulation may be enforced there is significant international pressure against the us and the national security agency nsa regarding the collection of data by the nsa from us companies further restrictions or regulation in the european union could result as a direct reaction to these eventsnew laws or regulations in particular financial or privacy laws or regulations enacted in jurisdictions in which we do business that require data including customer information transaction data or other information to be stored locally on servers in that jurisdiction andor prohibit such data from being transmitted outside of that jurisdiction 29which would increase our operational costs or capital expenditures and potentially impact the performance or availability of our services andor our ability to use or process customer datathe european union has also proposed new data laws that give customers additional rights and provide additional restrictions and harsher penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information including restrictions on the use of internet tracking tools called cookies while the european union directive on cookies has taken effect the manner in which member states adopt implementing legislation and whether the european union deems that legislation sufficient continues to evolve to the extent implementing legislation by member states is more restrictive it could negatively impact the manner in which we use cookies for many of our services ranging from advertising to antifraud and require us to incur additional costs or change our business practices california continues to pass privacy regulations which may be subsequently copied and passed in other states as many of these laws have yet to be implemented it is unclear how these laws may impact consumer perception of privacy or how they may impact our businessesin the us the federal trade commission or ftc and the white house have both proposed us privacy frameworks and in 2012 legislation was introduced in the us senate which would have required organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to notify owners of the breached information and in some instances notify the federal bureau of investigation or us secret service similar legislation may be introduced and enacted in the future other countries in which we operate have recently adopted and implemented privacy and data protection laws and regulations for the first time or are in the process of doing so our current data protection policies and practices may not be consistent with new laws and regulations or evolving interpretations and applications it is unclear how the application of existing privacy laws and regulations will impact mobile services and technologies which are evolving rapidly complying with these varying national requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business the legislative and regulatory environment around mobile data collection continues to evolve legislators and regulators in various jurisdictions are increasingly focusing on the capture and use of locationbased information relating to users of mobile devices any legislation or regulations restricting or limiting the collection or use of mobile data including the type of information that may be collected from mobile devices andor how such information may be collected and used could if enacted prohibit the use of certain technologies including those that track individuals activities on the internet or geolocation via mobile devices andor restrict or limit our ability to collect and use page viewing data and personal information which may reduce demand for our services or require changes to our current business models such as advertising which could harm our business any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with new mobile regulatory requirements or orders or other federal state or international privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws and regulations pertaining to mobile data collection or mobile devices could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others eg class action privacy litigation subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase our costs and adversely affect our businessin addition even technical violations of certain privacyrelated laws can result in significant penalties including statutory damages the federal communications commission amended its regulations effective july 2012 under the tcpa and has promulgated additional amendments effective october 2013 which could increase our exposure to liability for certain types of telephonic communication with customers including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones under the tcpa plaintiffs may seek actual monetary loss or statutory damages of 500 per violation whichever is greater and courts may treble the damage award for willful or knowing violations two putative classaction lawsuits have been filed containing allegations that our businesses violated the tcpa roberts v paypal filed in the us district court for the northern district of california in february 2012 contains allegations that commercial advertisements for paypal products and services were sent via text message to mobile phones without prior consent in may 2013 the court granted paypals motion for summary judgment challenging the viability of plaintiffs individual claim on grounds that plaintiff consented to receive the text message and entered judgment in favor of paypal plaintiff has filed an appeal of this judgment murray v bill me later filed in the us district court for the northern district of illinois in june 2012 contains allegations that bill me later made calls featuring artificial or prerecorded voices without prior consent these lawsuits and other private lawsuits not currently alleged as class actions seek damages including statutory damages and injunctive relief among other remedies given the enormous number of communications we send to our users a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to paypals or bill me laters practices or those of any of our other companies under the tcpa or other communicationsbased statutes could expose us to significant damage awards that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business also we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection use and disclosure of user data any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal state or international privacy or consumer protectionrelated laws and 30regulations or in the case of our enterprise business any such failure or perceived failure on the part of our enterprise business or its clients could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others eg class action privacy litigation subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity require us to change our business practices increase our costs and adversely affect our business the ftc and state regulatory agencies have become more aggressive in enforcing privacy and data protection laws and regulations for example in 2012 the ftc entered into a number of consent decrees with a number of major online companies including facebook and google to settle allegations of unfair or deceptive privacy practices the ftcs consent decrees with facebook and google require each of those companies to implement a comprehensive privacy program and undergo regular independent privacy audits for 20 years among other requirements in december 2012 californias attorney general filed a lawsuit against delta air lines for failing to include a privacy policy in its mobile applications certain of our products including some of enterprises marketing solutions utilize behavioral marketing generally the tracking of a users online activities to deliver relevant content to internet users the ftc has released a staff report with principles to address consumer privacy issues that may arise from behavioral marketing and to encourage industry selfregulation in march 2012 the ftc issued a final report titled protecting consumer privacy in an era of rapid change recommendations for businesses and policymakers which details the ftcs perspective on best practices for companies that collect and use consumer data to protect the privacy of consumers should the ftc pursue enforcement actions related to these business practices we may be required to modify our business practices to conform and incur substantial costs which could harm our business data collection privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern if internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites mobile platforms products and services as a result our business could be harmed as noted above we are also subject to the possibility of security breaches which themselves may result in a violation of these lawsbill me laters operations expose us to additional risks risks associated with our reliance on unaffiliated lenders in providing the bill me later service are discussed in more detail under the caption bill me laters operations depend on lending services provided by unaffiliated lenders above the bill me later service relies on thirdparty merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions for the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 59 of all transaction volume by dollar amount through the bill me later service was settled through the facilities of a single vendor any disruption to these third party payment processing and gateway services would adversely affect the bill me later service the bill me later service is offered to a wide range of consumers and the financial success of this business depends on the ability of the issuing banks of the bill me later credit products to manage credit risk related to those products the lenders extend credit using bill me laters proprietary segmentation and credit scoring algorithms and other analytical techniques designed to analyze the credit risk of specific customers based on their past purchasing and payment history as well as their credit scores based on these performance criteria a lender may extend or increase lines of credit to consumers at the point of sale these algorithms and techniques may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of a consumer due to inaccurate assumptions about a particular consumer or the economic environment among other factors the accuracy of the predictions and the ability of the lenders and bill me later to manage credit risk related to the bill me later service may also be affected by legal or regulatory changes eg bankruptcy laws and minimum payment regulations competitors actions changes in consumer behavior and other factors a lender may incorrectly interpret the data produced by these algorithms in setting its credit policies which may impact the financial performance of the bill me later service in addition economic and financial conditions in the us may affect consumer confidence levels and reduce consumers ability or willingness to use credit including the credit extended by a lender to consumers who use the bill me later service which could impair the growth and profitability of this business over the past several years the volume of credit extended by the financial institutions issuing the bill me later credit products has increased as we have continued to enable qualified buyers with a paypal account to use bill me later as a payment funding option for transactions on ebaycom and on certain merchant websites that accept paypal we purchase the receivables relating to these consumer loans extended by the issuing banks and therefore bear the risk of loss in the event of loan defaults like other businesses with significant exposure to losses from consumer credit the bill me later service faces the risk that account holders will default on their payment obligations with respect to the consumer loans making the receivables uncollectible and creating the risk of potential chargeoffs the rate at which receivables were charged off as uncollectible or the net chargeoff rate was approximately 567 for the year ended december 31 2013 the nonpayment rate 31among bill me later users may increase due to among other things changes to underwriting standards by bill me later and the financial institutions issuing the bill me later credit products worsening economic conditions such as a recession or greater austerity in the us and high unemployment rates consumers who miss payments on their obligations often fail to repay them and consumers who file for protection under the bankruptcy laws generally do not repay their credit paypal has also begun a pilot program working with webbank for webbank to offer working capital financing to selected sellers in the us and for paypal to purchase the related receivables this program is still in the pilot phase however if expanded it would present risks similar to those discussed above associated with the bill me later servicewe purchase receivables related to bill me later accounts through borrowings and domestic and international cash resources if we are unable to fund our purchase of receivables related to the bill me later business adequately or in a costeffective manner the growth and profitability of this business would be significantly and adversely affected additionally in providing the bill me later service and other similar programs in the future we face other risks similar to those faced by paypal described elsewhere in these risk factors including under the captions government inquiries may lead to charges or penalties our payments business is subject to a number of laws and regulations including those governing banking money transmission and payment services that vary in the markets where we operate and our payments business is subject to consumer protection laws and regulations our revenue from advertising is subject to factors beyond our control we derive significant revenue from advertising on our websites and applications revenues from online advertising are sensitive to events and trends that affect advertising expenditures such as general changes in the economy and changes in consumer spending the effectiveness of online advertising versus offline advertising media and the value our websites provide to advertisers relative to other websites the economic downturn adversely impacted our advertising revenue in addition major search engine operators eg google have the ability to change from time to time at their sole discretion the rules and search algorithms governing the pricing availability and placement of online advertising and do so periodically for example changes by google since october 2012 have significantly reduced the amount of traffic our marketplaces business receives from free search on google any further changes in these rules or search algorithms could materially reduce the value that we derive from online advertising on our websites either directly or indirectly for example retailers pay a fee to us for online shoppers directed to their websites by the ebay commerce network which consists of the shoppingcom websites and their distribution network rule changes made by search engines beginning in 2008 disrupted traffic to our shoppingcom websites which in turn adversely affected clickthrough traffic to retailers from our shoppingcom websites and associated fee revenue in addition legislators and regulators in various jurisdictions including the us and the european union are reviewing internet advertising models and the use of userrelated data including locationbased information relating to users of mobile devices and are considering proposals that could restrict or otherwise impact these business models and practices if we experience a reduction in our advertising revenues due to economic competitive regulatory technological or other factors the renegotiation of our contracts with major advertising companies on unfavorable terms or a reduction in our ability to effectively place advertisements on our websites or are otherwise unable to provide value to our advertisers our business and financial results would suffer our growth will depend on our ability to develop our brands and these efforts may be costly we believe that continuing to strengthen our brands will be critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our services and will require a continued focus on active marketing efforts across all of our brands we will need to continue to spend substantial amounts of money on and devote substantial resources to advertising marketing and other efforts to create and maintain brand loyalty among users since 2005 we have significantly increased the number of brands we are supporting adding our classified websites including den blå avis bilbasen ebay classifieds including ebay anuncios ebay kleinanzeigen and ebay annunci gittigidiyor gumtree kijiji loquo marktplaatsnl mobilede alamaula and 2dehandsbe stubhub bill me later gmarket milo where redlaser enterprise and ebay now among others each of these brands requires its own resources increasing the costs of our branding efforts brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues and even if they do any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brands also major search engine operators that we use to advertise our brands have frequently changing rules that govern the pricing availability and placement of online advertisements eg paid search keywords and changes to these rules could require us to increase our spending on online advertisements and adversely affect our ability to use online advertising to promote our brands in a costeffective manner if we fail to promote and maintain our brands or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands our business and financial results would suffer 32new and existing regulations could harm our business we are subject to the same foreign and domestic laws as other companies conducting business on and off the internet it is not always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property issues parallel imports and distribution controls consumer protection taxation libel and defamation obscenity and personal privacy apply to our businesses many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet mobile and related technologies and as a result do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies those laws that do reference the internet such as the us digital millennium copyright act the us canspam act and the european unions distance selling directive which will be superseded by the new consumer rights directive which the member states are in the process of implementing and electronic commerce directive are being interpreted by the courts but their applicability and scope remain uncertain as our activities the types of goods and services listed on our websites and mobile platforms the products and services we offer including through acquisitions such as bill me later and stubhub and our geographical scope continue to expand regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we or our users are subject to additional requirements including licensure or prohibited from conducting our business in their jurisdiction either generally or with respect to certain actions eg the sale of real estate event tickets cultural goods boats and automobiles or the application of distance selling laws recent financial and political events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on large companies in general and financial services companies in particular and regulatory agencies may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past and in a manner adverse to our businesses our success and increased visibility has driven some existing businesses that perceive our business models to be a threat to their businesses to raise concerns about our business models to policymakers and regulators these businesses and their trade association groups employ significant resources in their efforts to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations they may employ these resources in an effort to change the legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to reduce the effectiveness of our businesses and the ability of users to use our products and services in particular these established businesses have raised concerns relating to pricing parallel imports professional seller obligations selective distribution networks stolen goods copyrights trademarks and other intellectual property rights and the liability of the provider of an internet marketplace for the conduct of its users related to those and other issues any changes to the legal or regulatory regimes in a manner that would increase our liability for thirdparty listings could negatively impact our business over the last few years some large retailers and their trade associations have sought legislation in a number of states and the us congress that would make ebay liable for the sale of stolen property or would ban certain categories of goods from sale on our platform including gift cards and health and beauty products while no such legislation has passed to date the proponents continue to seek passage of such legislation and if any of these laws are adopted they could harm our business numerous states and foreign jurisdictions including the state of california where our headquarters are located have regulations regarding auctions and the handling of property by secondhand dealers or pawnbrokers several states and some foreign jurisdictions have attempted to impose such regulations upon us or our users and others may attempt to do so in the future attempted enforcement of these laws against some of our users appears to be increasing in france we were sued by conseil des ventes the french auction regulatory authority which has alleged that sales on our french website constitute illegal auctions that cannot be performed without its consent we won this lawsuit a lawsuit alleging similar claims has been brought against us by two associations of french antique dealers and is now pending on appeal after we won in the first instance we intend to vigorously defend against these lawsuits however these and other regulatory and licensure claims and enforcement actions could result in costly litigation and if unsuccessful we could be required to change the way we or our users do business in ways that increase costs or reduce revenues for example by forcing us to prohibit listings of certain items or restrict certain listing formats in some locations we could also be subject to fines or other penalties and any of these outcomes could harm our business a number of the lawsuits against us relating to trademark issues seek to have our websites subject to unfavorable local laws for example trademark exhaustion principles provide trademark owners with certain rights to control the sale of a branded authentic product until it has been placed on the market by the trademark holder or with the holders consent the application of trademark exhaustion principles is largely unsettled in the context of the internet and if trademark owners are able to force us to prohibit listings of certain items in one or more locations our business could be harmed as we expand and localize our international activities we may become obligated to comply with the laws of the countries or markets in which we operate in addition because our services are accessible worldwide and we facilitate sales of goods and provide services to users worldwide one or more jurisdictions may claim that we or our users are required to comply with their laws based on the location of our servers or one or more of our users or the location of the product or service being sold or 33provided in an ecommerce transaction for example in the louis vuitton malletier litigation we were found liable in france under french law for transactions on some of our websites worldwide that did not involve french buyers or sellers see item 3 legal proceedings below laws regulating internet and ecommerce companies outside of the us are generally less favorable than those in the us giving greater rights to consumers content owners competitors users and other third parties compliance may be more costly or may require us to change our business practices or restrict our service offerings and the imposition of any regulations on us or our users may harm our business in addition we may be subject to multiple overlapping legal or regulatory regimes that impose conflicting requirements on us eg in crossborder trade our alleged failure to comply with foreign laws could subject us to penalties ranging from criminal prosecution to significant fines to bans on our services in addition to the significant costs we may incur in defending against such actions following the global financial crisis us federal lawmakers enacted the doddfrank act overhauling the federal governments oversight of consumer financial products and systemic risk in the us financial system although the full effect of the new legislation will be dependent on regulations to be adopted by a number of different agencies including the consumer financial protection bureau we expect the general effect of the financial reform law will be to require paypal and bill me later to make additional disclosures to their users and to impose new restrictions on certain of their activities for example in january 2012 the consumer financial protection bureau finalized new regulations required by the doddfrank act that required paypal starting in late october 2013 to provide additional disclosures error resolution rights and cancellation rights to us consumers who make international remittance payments which could increase our costs of processing international payments the consumer financial protection bureau has also launched a complaints portal on its website that allows customers to file complaints against paypal and other money transfer service providers and publishes information on such complaints these and other new obligations will impose new compliance requirements and obligations on us that could increase our costs may result in increased litigation and the need to make expensive product changes and may otherwise adversely impact our business in addition we also expect that the continued implementation of the doddfrank act will adversely impact some significant traditional revenue streams for banks for example in june 2011 the federal reserve board issued a final rule capping debit card interchange fees as a result of this and other regulations implementing the financial reform law banks may need to revise their business models to remain profitable which may lead them to charge more for services which were previously provided for free or at lower cost any resulting increases in service fees required for paypal to process transactions eg service fees for automated clearing house transactions would increase our costs and could adversely affect our business our business and users may be subject to sales tax and other taxesthe application of indirect taxes such as sales and use tax valueadded tax vat goods and services tax business tax and gross receipt tax to ecommerce businesses such as ebay and to our users is a complex and evolving issue many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the internet and ecommerce in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to the internet or ecommerce in addition governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues including through indirect taxessome jurisdictions have implemented or may implement laws specifically addressing the internet or some aspect of ecommerce for example the state of new york has passed legislation that requires any outofstate seller of tangible personal property to collect and remit new york use tax if the seller engages affiliates above certain financial thresholds in new york to perform certain business promotion activities in march 2013 the new york court of appeals new york states highest court upheld this legislation in amazoncom llc and overstockcom inc v new york state department of taxation and finance in august 2013 amazoncom llc and overstockcom inc filed writs of certiorari with the us supreme court in december 2013 the supreme court denied these writs so the new york law remains in effect in september 2012 california enacted a new law which is similar to the law passed in new york but provides exclusions for certain forms of internet marketing and is limited to retailers who exceed prescribed sales volume thresholds however if our sellers who are not already required to collect california sales or use tax believe that their use of our websites requires them to collect california use tax they may elect to limit their use of our websites rather than collect the tax which would harm our business several other states have also enacted similar laws related to affiliates and a number of other states are considering similar legislation in addition the pennsylvania department of revenue has ruled that an outofstate retailer using pennsylvaniabased affiliates could have nexus in pennsylvania under existing statutes most of these new laws and positions are being challenged and in may 2012 a cook county circuit court judge ruled that the illinois internet affiliate nexus law was unconstitutional the state of illinois filed a direct appeal to the illinois supreme court in october 2013 the illinois supreme court upheld the trial court decision the adoption of such legislation by states where ebay has significant operations that perform certain business promotion activities could result in a use tax collection responsibility for certain of our sellers this collection responsibility 34and the additional costs associated with complex use tax collection remittance and audit requirements would make selling on our websites and mobile platforms less attractive for small business retailers and would harm our businessthe state of colorado has enacted legislation that takes a different approach by imposing a set of use tax notice and reporting requirements but not the actual tax collection responsibility on certain retailers with no physical presence in colorado the law is designed to aid colorado in collecting use tax from colorado residents who purchase taxable items from outofstate retailers the regulation promulgated by the colorado department of revenue excludes from these reporting obligations businesses that sell 100000 or less into the state in a calendar year thus limiting the impact on our sellers the law has been challenged in federal court by a number of outofstate retailers and a federal district court has issued an injunction blocking enforcement of the regulations pending a resolution of the case in march 2012 a federal judge struck down the colorado law as unconstitutional finding that it discriminated against interstate commerce oklahoma has enacted a similar law but has not taken any published enforcement action to date while the application of these new state laws to our marketplaces business has limited direct impact the proliferation of such state legislation to expand sales and use tax collection on internet sales could adversely affect some of our sellers and indirectly harm our business in conjunction with the streamlined sales tax project  an ongoing multiyear effort by us state and local governments to require collection and remittance of remote sales tax by outofstate sellers  us senate and us house versions of the marketplace fairness act s 336 and hr 684 were introduced in the 113th congress in 2013 the us senate passed s 336 on may 6 2013 with bipartisan support and hr 684 has been referred to the house judiciary committee for review if enacted into law these measures would allow states that meet certain simplification and other standards to require outofstate sellers to collect and remit sales taxes on goods purchased by instate residents it is expected that some sellers meeting an as yet undefined small seller exception would be excluded from the requirements of the act the adoption of remote sales tax collection legislation that lacks a robust small business exemption would result in the imposition of sales taxes and additional costs associated with complex sales tax collection remittance and audit compliance requirements on many of our sellers this would make selling online less attractive for small retailers and would likely harm our businessfrom time to time some taxing authorities have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes in may 2008 the city of chicago notified both ebay and stubhub that they are liable for a city amusement tax on tickets to events in chicago irrespective of the location of the buyer or seller and filed suit to enforce collection of taxes it claims are due in a series of rulings issued in 2009 the court ruled that stubhub is not required to collect and remit the city amusement tax entered a final order dismissing the case against stubhub and dismissed the case against ebay the city of chicago appealed both matters to the seventh circuit court of appeals which subsequently certified the state law arguments to the illinois state supreme court in october 2011 the illinois supreme court ruled that state municipalities may not require electronic intermediaries such as stubhub to collect and remit amusement taxes on resold tickets that decision is now final the application of similar existing or future laws including the imposition of similar taxes by taxing authorities could adversely affect our business several proposals have been made at the us state and local levels that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet these proposals if adopted could substantially impair the growth of ecommerce and our brands and could diminish our opportunity to derive financial benefit from our activities the us federal governments moratorium on state and local taxation of internet access or multiple or discriminatory taxes on ecommerce has been extended through november 2014 this moratorium does not prohibit federal state or local authorities from collecting taxes on our income or from collecting certain taxes that were in effect prior to the enactment of the moratorium andor one of its extensions similar issues exist outside of the us where the application of vat or other indirect taxes on ecommerce providers such as ebay is uncertain and evolving while we attempt to comply in those jurisdictions where it is clear that a tax is due certain of our subsidiaries have from time to time received claims relating to the applicability of indirect taxes to our fees in april 2012 we received notices of reassessments for tax years 20012005 from the canadian revenue agency cra which assert goods and service tax gst and harmonized sales tax hst on our fees charged to canadian users these reassessments of gsthst were the result of an audit of ebay international ag and are based on the cras assertion that we were doing business in canada for gsthst purposes we disagreed with the reassessments and filed a notice of appeal with the tax court of canada in july 2012 the cra asked us to settle this matter with no tax due and in june 2013 we received reassessments showing that no tax was due should such taxes become applicable our business could be harmed we collect and remit indirect taxes in certain jurisdictions however tax authorities may raise questions about our obligation to collect and remit such taxes as well as the proper calculation of such taxes for example the korean tax authority asserted that certain coupons and incentives available on our sites should not be deducted when computing taxes on our fees we challenged these assessments and in june 2012 the national tax tribunal issued a final ruling in our favor with respect to item incentives from june 2006 onward the assessments on item incentives up to may 2006 and coupons up to june 2010 are being reviewed by the korea supreme court following two lower courts rulings in our favor in january and november 2013 respectively 35should any new taxes become applicable to our fees or if the taxes we pay are found to be deficient our business could be harmed we do not collect taxes on the goods or services sold by users of our services one or more states or the federal government or foreign countries may seek to impose a tax collection reporting or recordkeeping obligation on companies that engage in or facilitate ecommerce such an obligation could be imposed by legislation intended to improve tax compliance and legislation to such effect has been contemplated by several states and a number of foreign jurisdictions or if an ebay company was ever deemed to be the legal agent of the users of our services by a jurisdiction in which ebay operates in july 2008 the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 hr 3221 was signed into law this law contains provisions that require companies that provide payments over electronic means to users to report to the internal revenue service irs information on payments received by certain customers the legislation effective for payments received after december 31 2010 requires paypal and other electronic payments processors as well as stubhub and similar companies to report to the irs on customers subject to us income tax who receive more than 20000 in payments and more than 200 payments in a calendar year this requires us to request tax id numbers from certain payees track payments by tax id number and under certain conditions withhold a portion of payments and forward such withholding to the irs we have had to modify our software to meet these requirements and expect increased operational costs and changes to our user experience in connection with complying with these reporting obligations the irs regulations also require us to collect a certification of nonus taxpayer status from certain international merchants the foreign account tax compliance act which took effect at the start of 2013 is likely to require an increase in the number of nonus customers from whom we must obtain a similar certification and to increase the compliance burdens on us these requirements may decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business any failure by us to meet these new requirements could result in substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions and could harm our businessone or more other jurisdictions may also seek to impose tax collection or reporting obligations based on the location of the product or service being sold or provided in an ecommerce transaction regardless of where the respective users are located imposition of a discriminatory record keeping or tax collecting requirement could decrease seller activity on our sites and would harm our business foreign authorities may also require ebay to help ensure compliance by our users with local laws regulating professional sellers including tax requirements in addition we have periodically received requests from tax authorities in many jurisdictions for information regarding the transactions of large classes of sellers on our sites and in some cases we have been legally obligated to provide this data the imposition of any requirements on us to disclose transaction records for all or a class of sellers to tax or other regulatory authorities or to file tax forms on behalf of any sellers especially requirements that are imposed on us but not on alternative means of ecommerce and any use of those records to investigate collect taxes from or prosecute sellers could decrease seller activity on our sites and harm our business we pay input vat on applicable taxable purchases within the various countries in which we operate in most cases we are entitled to reclaim this input vat from the various countries however because of our unique business model the application of the laws and rules that allow such reclamation is sometimes uncertain a successful assertion by one or more countries that we are not entitled to reclaim vat could harm our business we continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify ebays obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations passage of new legislation and the imposition of additional tax or taxrelated reporting requirements could harm our users and our business there has been an increased interest by certain governing and regulatory bodies as well as the international press especially in europe in the tax affairs of multinational and ecommerce companies while this increased scrutiny has not resulted in any changes in the way taxes are imposed it could lead to changes in laws or critical investigations of our operations and structure in the future this could lead to additional tax costs and harm our businesspaypals retail point of sale solutions expose us to additional riskspaypal has announced several retail point of sale solutions to accept payment such as the paypal here devices which enables merchants to use a card reader attached to a mobile device or to scan cards and checks using the mobile devices embedded camera and the beacon device which enables merchants to process transactions more easily for consumers who enable the capability on their mobile phone paypal has also launched instore pilot programs for other new point of sale technologies which have been rolled out to certain retailers in the us as paypal continues to expand into point of sale transactions paypal will face additional risks includingexpectations from offline retailers regarding the reliability and availability of its systems and services and correspondingly lower amounts of downtime which paypal may not be able to meet 36paypals retail point of sale solutions may be targeted by fraudsters and given that our fraud models are less developed in this area we may experience increases in fraud and associated transaction losses as we adjust to fraudulent activity at the point of sale the manufacturing and sale of hardware products eg the paypal here devices and the beacon device exposes us to potential product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability and could require product recalls or other actions paypals point of sale solutions also may subject us to increased exposure to other laws and regulations eg export control regulations related to the shipment of the paypal here reader across national borders paypals continued expansion into point of sale transactions is dependent in part upon cooperation with third parties including the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions if we are unable to maintain these relationships or enter into new agreements for necessary services on acceptable terms our ability to expand our presence at the point of sale could be harmed significant competition at the retail point of sale and there can be no assurance that merchants will adopt or consumers will use paypals retail point of sale solutions and lower profit margins than paypals other payment solutions unless we are able to successfully manage these risks including driving adoption of and significant volume through our retail point of sale solutions over time our business may suffer changes in paypals funding mix could adversely affect paypals results paypal pays significant transaction fees when customers fund payment transactions using credit cards lower fees when customers fund payments with debit cards nominal fees when customers fund payment transactions by electronic transfer of funds from bank accounts and no fees when customers fund payment transactions from an existing paypal account balance or through the bill me later service or use buyer credit issued by ge money bank customers fund a significant portion of paypals payment volume using credit and debit cards and paypals financial success is highly sensitive to changes in the rate at which its customers fund payments using credit and debit cards customers may prefer funding payment transactions using credit cards or debit cards rather than bank account transfers for a number of reasons including the ability to dispute and reverse charges directly with their payment card provider if merchandise is not delivered or is not as described the ability to earn frequent flier miles cash rebates or other incentives offered by payment card issuers the ability to defer payment or a reluctance to provide bank account information to paypal in addition some of paypals offerings including the ability for buyers to make a limited number of guest payments without opening a paypal account have a higher rate of payment card funding than paypals basic product offering further some of paypals plans to lower its funding costs including both the bill me later credit products and service and the ability for buyers to defer payment for a short period of time on some transactions may increase the risk to paypal of nonpayment by buyers if we experience an increase in fees associated with our funding mix or in losses associated with nonpayment by buyers our business and financial results could suffer paypals failure to manage customer funds properly could harm its business paypals ability to manage and account accurately for customer funds requires a high level of internal controls in some of the markets that paypal serves and currencies that paypal offers paypal has a limited operating history and limited experience in managing these internal controls as paypals business continues to grow it must continue to strengthen its internal controls accordingly paypals success requires significant public confidence in its ability to handle large and growing transaction volumes and amounts of customer funds any failure to maintain necessary controls or to manage customer funds accurately could severely diminish customer use of paypals products andor result in penalties and fines which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our business we have experienced system failures from time to time and any interruption in the availability of our websites applications products or services will reduce our current revenues and profits could harm our future revenues and profits and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny our ebaycom website has been interrupted for periods of up to 22 hours in august 2013 technical issues affected several of our websites resulting in intermittent outages over a period of just over six hours and in april 2012 technical systems issues resulted in ebaycom users being unable to checkout on our sites for a period of several hours our paypal website has suffered intermittent unavailability for periods as long as five days including unavailability for approximately three hours affecting payments primarily on our ebaycouk site in may 2011 other of our websites eg 37stubhub milo and others as well as websites of enterprise clients and hosted services offered by our enterprise business have experienced intermittent unavailability from time to time any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate and possibly substantial loss of revenues as well as potential service credits or other payments by our enterprise business to its clients frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our sites and could permanently harm our reputation and brands reliability is particularly critical for paypal which faces increased expectations on the part of users and merchants regarding the fulltime availability of paypals services as it seeks to expand its merchant services business and gain acceptance of its retail point of sale solutions because paypal is a regulated financial institution frequent or persistent site interruptions could lead to significant fines and penalties or mandatory and costly changes to paypals business practices and ultimately could cause paypal to lose existing licenses it needs to operate or prevent it from obtaining additional licenses that it needs to expand finally because many of our customers may use our products for critical transactions any system failures could result in damage to our customers and their businesses these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses even if unsuccessful this type of claim likely would be timeconsuming and costly for us to address although our systems have been designed around industrystandard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes hurricanes floods fires power loss telecommunication failures terrorist attacks cyber attacks computer viruses computer denialofservice attacks human error hardware or software defects or malfunctions including defects or malfunctions of components of our systems that are supplied by thirdparty service providers and similar events or disruptions some of our systems including our shoppingcom websites and the systems related to the bill me later business are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities our systems are also subject to breakins sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism despite any precautions we may take the occurrence of a natural disaster a decision by any of our thirdparty hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failuresif we are unable to costeffectively upgrade and expand our websites services and platforms our business would suffer we must constantly add new hardware update software and add new engineering personnel to accommodate the increased use of our websites and platforms and the new products and features we regularly introduce as our paypal business continues to grow and expand both in terms of geographies and product offerings eg paypals retail point of sale solutions we are focused on updating our paypal platform to provide increased scale improved performance and additional builtin functionality addressing regulatory compliance matters eg antimoney laundering and terrorist financing this upgrade process is expensive and timeconsuming and the increased complexity of our websites and the need to support multiple platforms as our portfolio of brands grows increases the cost of additional enhancements failure to upgrade our technology features transaction processing systems security infrastructure or network infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner to accommodate increased traffic or transaction volume or changes to our site functionality could result in adverse consequences including unanticipated system disruptions slower response times degradation in levels of customer support impaired quality of users experiences of our services impaired quality of services for thirdparty application developers using our externally accessible application programming interfaces and delays in reporting accurate financial information and could result in customer dissatisfaction and the loss of existing users on our websites we may be unable to effectively upgrade and expand our systems in a timely manner or smoothly integrate any newly developed or purchased technologies or businesses with our existing systems and any failure to do so could result in problems on our websites further steps to increase the reliability and redundancy of our systems are expensive could reduce our margins and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtimerisks associated with our ongoing efforts to migrate existing enterprise clients to the new platform are discussed in more detail under the caption if our enterprise business is unable to migrate certain existing clients to its new suite of commerce technologies in a timely and costeffective manner it would be substantially harmed above 38there are many risks associated with our international operationsour international expansion has been rapid and our international business especially in germany the uk and korea has also become critical to our revenues and profits net revenues outside the us accounted for approximately 52 of our net revenues in the year ended december 31 2013  expansion into international markets such as our entry into turkey in may 2011 upon the completion of our acquisition of additional shares in gittigidiyor and marketplaces and paypals entry into emerging markets is an increasing focus of our business geographical expansion requires significant management attention and resources and requires us to localize our services to conform to local cultures laws regulations standards policies and practices the commercial financial internet and transportation infrastructure in developing countries may make it more difficult for us to replicate our business models some of these developing countries may have legal regimes in which the application of laws and regulations in the online or mobile context is subject to greater uncertainty as well as a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent or unethical business practices than countries in which we are historically accustomed to operating in many countries we compete with local companies that understand the local market better than we do and we may not benefit from firsttomarket advantages we may not be successful in expanding into particular international markets or in generating revenues from foreign operations for example in 2002 we withdrew our ebay marketplace offering from the japanese market in 2007 we contributed our business in china to a joint venture with a local chinese company we terminated this joint venture in 2012 even if we are successful in developing new markets we often expect the costs of operating new sites to exceed our net revenues from those sites for at least 12 months in most countries as we continue to expand our businesses internationally including through acquisitions and joint ventures we are increasingly subject to risks of doing business internationally including the followingstrong local competitorslegal and regulatory requirements including regulation of internet and mobile services auctioneering professional selling distance selling privacy and data protection banking and money transmitting that may limit or prevent the offering of our services in some jurisdictions prevent enforceable agreements between sellers and buyers prohibit the listing of certain categories of goods require product or service changes require special licensure subject us to criminal sanctions andor various taxes penalties or audits or limit the transfer of information between us and our affiliatescustoms and duties including the possibility of cumbersome shipping and delivery logistics significant delays at the border due to customs inspections maximum limits on the number of crossborder imports by consumers and the possibility that our services may be viewed as facilitating customs fraud by governmental authoritiesgreater liability or legal uncertainty regarding our liability for the listings and other content provided by our users including uncertainty as a result of unique local laws conflicting court decisions and lack of clear precedent or applicable lawrisks associated with crossborder transactions including those described under the risk factor caption any factors that reduce crossborder trade could harm our business abovepotentially higher incidence of fraud and corruption and higher credit and transaction loss risks

ownership of certain businessesdifficulties in integrating with local payment providers including banks credit and debit card networks and electronic fund transfer systemsdiffering levels of retail distribution shipping and internet and mobile infrastructuresdifferent employeeemployer relationships and labor laws and the existence of workers councils and labor unionsdifficulties in staffing and

and greater problems in collecting accounts receivablepotentially adverse tax consequences including local taxation of our fees or of transactions on our websiteshigher internet service provider or mobile network operator costsdiffering intellectual property lawsdifferent and more stringent consumer protection data protection privacy and other laws39seasonal reductions in business activityexpenses associated with localizing our products and services including offering customers the ability to transact business in the local currency and adapting our products and services to local preferences eg payment methods with which we may have limited or no experienceforeign exchange rate fluctuationsour ability to repatriate funds from abroad without adverse tax consequencesthe possibility that foreign governments may impose currency controls or other restrictions on the repatriation of fundschanges in the business practices of the card networks or participating banks eg dynamic currency conversionvolatility in a specific countrys or regions political economic or military conditions eg in south korea relating to north korea andchallenges associated with maintaining relationships with local law enforcement and related agenciesthese factors may cause our international costs of doing business to exceed our comparable domestic costs as we expand our international operations and have additional portions of our international revenues denominated in foreign currencies we also could become subject to increased difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and repatriating money without adverse tax consequences as well as increased risks relating to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business is discussed above in more detail under the caption we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates compliance with complex foreign and us laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business these numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules data privacy and filtering requirements anticorruption laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and uk bribery act other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials and antitrust and competition regulations among others violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties criminal sanctions against us andor our directors officers or employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially affect our brands our international expansion efforts our ability to attract and retain employees our business and our operating results although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies in addition we conduct certain functions including product development customer support and other operations in regions outside the us particularly in india and china we are subject to both us and local laws and regulations applicable to our offshore activities and any factors which reduce the anticipated benefits associated with providing these functions outside of the us including cost efficiencies and productivity improvements could adversely affect our business we maintain a portion of our research and development facilities and personnel in israel and have acquired other israeli companies political economic and military conditions in israel affect those operations increased hostilities or terrorism within israel or armed hostilities between israel and neighboring countries or other entities could make it more difficult for us to continue our operations in israel which could increase our costs in addition many of our employees in israel could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time under emergency circumstances our israeli operations could be disrupted by the absence of employees due to military service which could adversely affect our business acquisitions joint ventures and strategic investments could result in operating difficulties dilution and other harmful consequences we have acquired a significant number of businesses of varying size and scope technologies services and products in december 2013 we acquired braintree which provides an online and mobile payments platform we expect to continue to evaluate and consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions as part of our overall business strategy including business combinations acquisitions and dispositions of businesses technologies services products and other assets as well as strategic investments and joint ventures at any given time we may be engaged in discussions or negotiations with respect to one or more of these types of transactions any of these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations these transactions involve significant challenges and risks some of the areas where we may face risks or difficulties includethe need to integrate the operations systems including accounting management information human resource and 40other administrative systems technologies products and personnel of each acquired company which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process the inefficiencies and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented and unforeseen difficulties and expenditures that may arise as a resultthe potential loss of key customers merchants vendors and other key business partners eg payment processors of the companies we acquire following and continuing after announcement of our acquisition plansdiversion of management time as well as a shift of focus from operating the businesses to issues related to integration and administration particularly given the number size and varying scope of our recent acquisitionsdeclining employee morale and retention issues resulting from changes in or acceleration of compensation or changes in management reporting relationships future prospects or the direction of the acquired businessthe need to implement controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition may have lacked such controls procedures and policiesrisks associated with our expansion into new international markets and doing business internationally including those described above under the risk factor caption there are many risks associated with our international operationsdifficulties in entering new markets where we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors may have stronger market positionsin the case of acquisitions involving foreign companies or operations the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular regulatory economic currency and political risks associated with specific countries or regionsin some cases the need to transition operations users and customers of our existing businesses or the acquired business as the case may be onto different platforms liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition including intellectual property and other litigation claims or disputes violations of laws rules and regulations commercial disputes tax liabilities and other known and unknown liabilities the potential loss of key employees following the acquisitionthe acquisition of new customer and employee personal information which in and of itself may require regulatory approval and or additional controls policies and procedures and subject us to additional exposure andfor investments in which an investees results of operations and financial condition are incorporated into our financial statements and operating metrics either in full or in part the dependence on the investees accounting financial reporting operating metrics and similar systems controls and processesit may take us longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefits such as increased revenue and volume and enhanced efficiencies of any or all of our acquisitions and those benefits andor enhanced efficiencies may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating results future acquisitions may also require us to issue additional equity securities spend our cash or incur debt and increased interest expense liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets or writeoffs of goodwill which could adversely affect our financial results results of operations and dilute the economic and voting rights of our stockholders in addition we have made certain investments including through joint ventures in which we have a minority equity interest and lack management and operational control the controlling joint venture partner in a joint venture investment may have business interests strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours and business decisions or other actions or omissions of the controlling joint venture partner or the joint venture company may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment in the joint venture in addition our strategic investments may expose us to additional risks for example we have a minority interest in intershop communications ag an entity governed by german law which could subject us to liability for certain disadvantages to intershop if we were deemed to be in control of intershop under german law we have also been sued by craigslist which has alleged that we improperly misused confidential information from craigslist that we received as a minority investor the complaint alleges breach of contract breach of fiduciary duty fraud unfair competition and false advertising and seeks compensatory and punitive damages rescission and other relief any circumstances which may be out of our control that adversely affect the value of our investments or cost resulting from regulatory action or lawsuits in connection with our investments could harm our business or negatively impact our financial results41our enterprise business exposes us to additional risksour enterprise business which consists of gsi commerce inc gsi commerce which we acquired in june 2011 faces certain risks and challenges not shared by our other businesses including those described under the risk factor captions if our enterprise business is unable to migrate certain existing clients to its new suite of commerce technologies in a timely and costeffective manner it would be substantially harmed and changes in regulations regulatory scrutiny or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could adversely affect our business competition for enterprises existing and potential clients is intense and our enterprise business may not be able to add new clients or keep existing clients on favorable terms or at all for example a change in the management of an enterprise client could adversely affect our relationship with that client in addition many of enterprises client contracts contain service level commitments if our enterprise business is unable to meet these commitments its relationships with its clients could be damaged and client rights to terminate their contracts with our enterprise business andor financial penalty provisions payable by our enterprise business may be triggered if any existing enterprise clients in particular the large merchants and brands that our enterprise business serves were to exit the business we provide services to be acquired declare bankruptcy suffer other financial difficulties fail to pay amounts owed to our enterprise business andor terminate or modify their relationships with our enterprise business in an unfavorable manner our enterprise business could be adversely affected a portion of enterprises net transaction revenue is derived from the value of ecommerce transactions that flow through its suite of commerce technologies accordingly growth in enterprises net transaction revenue depends upon the continued growth of the online businesses of its clients our enterprise business may be substantially impacted by any adverse conditions in the offline businesses of an enterprise client that negatively impact that clients online businesses any impairment of the offline business of enterprise clients whether due to financial difficulties impairment of client brands reduction in marketing efforts reduction in the number of client retail stores or otherwise could negatively affect consumer traffic and sales through enterprise clients websites which would result in lower revenues generated by our enterprise business our enterprise business also relies on its clients ability to accurately forecast product demand and select and buy the inventory for their corresponding online businesses under such arrangements the client establishes product prices and pays our enterprise business fees based either on a fixed or variable percentage of revenues or on the activity performed as a result if enterprise clients fail to accurately forecast product demand or optimize or maintain access to inventory the clients ecommerce business and in turn our enterprise fees could be adversely affectedour enterprise business holds some inventory on behalf of its clients if our enterprise business is unable to effectively manage and handle this inventory this may result in unexpected costs that could adversely affect our enterprise business any theft of such inventory or damage or interruption to such inventory including as a result of earthquakes hurricanes floods fire power loss labor disputes terrorist attacks and similar events and disruptions could result in losses related to such inventory and disruptions to the businesses of enterprise clients which could in turn adversely affect our enterprise businessour enterprise business processes personal information on behalf of its clients the personal information of customers of certain websites operated by enterprise clients may be regulated under the grammleachbliley act the health insurance portability and accountability act the childrens online privacy protection act or other privacy laws and regulations in some cases enterprises use or disclosure of that information may be restricted by contractual terms laws and regulations and any misuse or unpermitted disclosure of that information could negatively impact our enterprise business and its clients our enterprise business utilizes email marketing to drive consumer traffic to the websites operated by some of its clients email could become a less effective means of communicating with and marketing to consumers for a variety of reasons including problems with technology that make enterprises email communications more difficult to deliver and for consumers to read eg the inability of smart phones or similar communication devices to adequately display email consumers may disregard marketing emails due to the large volume of such emails they receive the inability of filters to effectively screen for unwanted emails resulting in increased levels of junk mail or spam which may overwhelm consumers email accounts increased use of social networking sites which may result in decreased use of email as a primary means of communication continued security concerns regarding internet usage in general from viruses worms or similar problems and increased governmental regulation or restrictive policies adopted by internet service providers that make it more difficult or costly to utilize email for marketing communications if any of our enterprise entities were to end up on spam lists or lists of entities that have been involved in sending unwanted unsolicited emails their ability to contact customers through email could be significantly restricted if any of the foregoing were to occur the demand for enterprise email marketing solutions could decrease and our enterprise business could be harmed our enterprise business also utilizes mobile messaging as a means of communicating with consumers which carries risks similar to those described above for email marketing42our enterprise business has relationships with search engines comparison shopping sites affiliate marketers online advertising networks and other websites to provide content advertising banners and other links to its clients ecommerce businesses and our enterprise business relies on these relationships as significant sources of traffic to its clients ecommerce businesses if we are unable to maintain these relationships or enter into new relationships on acceptable terms our ability to attract new customers could be harmedimmediately following our acquisition of gsi commerce we sold 100 of gsi commerces sports merchandise business and 70 of its ruelala and shoprunner businesses which we refer to collectively as the divested entities to kynetic llc which we refer to as kynetic kynetic is primarily owned by gsi commerces former chairman president and chief executive officer each of the divested entities was a direct or indirect whollyowned subsidiary of gsi commerce as part of the kynetic divestiture we loaned kynetic and the divested entities 467 million secured by certain assets of the divested entities in connection with and as a result of the divestiture to kynetic our enterprise business maintained certain commercial and financial relationships with the divested entities which expose it to certain risks of the businesses of kynetic and the divested entities in september 2013 this note receivable was repaid and our investments in ruelala and shoprunner were soldfinally our enterprise business is also party to certain acquisition agreements relating to entities purchased by gsi commerce prior to our acquisition of gsi commerce and which relate to businesses owned by the divested entities kynetic has agreed to indemnify our enterprise business for certain liabilities incurred by gsi commerce under these acquisition agreements if such liabilities were realized and kynetic was not able or willing to meet its indemnification obligations our enterprise business would be liable for them and its business could be harmedour tickets business is subject to regulatory competitive and other risks that could harm this business our tickets business which includes our stubhub business is subject to numerous risks many jurisdictions have antiscalping laws and regulations covering the resale of event tickets some jurisdictions prohibit the resale of event tickets at prices above the face value of the tickets or at all or highly regulate the resale of tickets and new laws and regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations imposing these or other restrictions may be adopted that could limit or inhibit our ability to operate or our users ability to continue to use our tickets business regulatory agencies or courts may claim or hold that we are responsible for ensuring that our users comply with these laws and regulations or that we or our users are either subject to licensure or prohibited from reselling event tickets in their jurisdictions in october 2007 two plaintiffs filed a purported class action lawsuit in north carolina superior court alleging that stubhub sold and facilitated and participated in the sale of concert tickets to plaintiffs with the knowledge that the tickets were resold in violation of north carolinas maximum ticket resale price law which has been subsequently amended in february 2011 the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment concluding that immunity under the communications decency act did not apply the trial court further held that stubhub violated the north carolina unfair and deceptive trade practices statute as it pertained to the two named plaintiffs and certified its decision for immediate appeal to the north carolina court of appeals in february 2012 the north carolina court of appeals overturned the lower courts decision and the court of appeals decision is now final similar actions are expected in other states laws and regulations governing the resale of event tickets outside the us for example in europe may be more restrictive and carry harsher penalties and fines than corresponding us laws and regulations in 2012 france passed a law prohibiting the habitual resale of event tickets without permission from the event organizer in 2013 belgium passed a similar law prohibiting habitual sale and subjecting occasional resale to a price cap restrictions on ticket resale are also under consideration by the dutch parliament and various state governments in australia in addition the unauthorized resale of football soccer tickets is illegal in the uk where a stubhub site was launched in 2011 while we have secured a number of commercial partnerships in the uk in order to enable our customers to buy and sell football soccer tickets if we are unable to maintain these partnerships or develop new partnerships on acceptable terms our tickets business would suffersome event organizers and professional sports teams have expressed concern about the resale of their event tickets on our sites lawuits alleging a variety of causes of actions have in the past and may in the future be filed against stubhub and ebay by venue owners competitors ticket buyers and unsuccessful ticket buyers such lawsuits could result in damage awards could require us to change our business practices in ways that may be harmful to our business or could otherwise negatively affect our tickets business our tickets business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and the general economic and business conditions that impact the sporting events and live entertainment industries the economic downturn resulted in a decrease in ticket prices sold on our sites and negatively impacted revenue and profits in addition a work stoppage strike or lockout by a professional sports league for example the national hockey league lockout that ended in january 2013 that results in the cancellation of all or a 43portion of the games in a leagues season would harm our tickets business in addition a portion of the tickets inventory sold by sellers on the stubhub website is processed by stubhub in digital form systems failures security breaches theft or other disruptions that result in the loss of such sellers tickets inventory could materially harm our tickets businessour tickets business also faces significant competition from a number of sources including ticketing service companies such as live nation entertainmentticketmaster comcastspectacor and ticketscom event organizers such as professional sports teams and leagues ticket brokers and online and offline ticket resellers such as ticketsnow which is owned by live nation entertainment and razorgator in addition some ticketing service companies and event organizers have begun to issue event tickets through various forms of electronic ticketing systems that are designed to restrict or prohibit the free transferability and by extension the free resale of such event tickets either to favor their own resale affiliates or to discourage resale similarly some professional sports teams have begun to introduce measures that may have the effect of discouraging season ticket holders from listing their tickets for sale through third party platforms such as the stubhub website that compete with the teams own or preferred secondary ticketing services such measures include making pdf versions of tickets available only for a limited period of time and imposing fees on season ticket holders to obtain pdf versions of their tickets pdf versions of tickets are one of the most popular formats for ticket listings on the stubhub website as a result to the extent that such measures result in our customers inability or unwillingness to list tickets for sale on the stubhub website our tickets business would be harmed ticketing service companies have also begun to use marketbased pricing strategies or dynamic pricing to charge much higher prices than they historically have for premium tickets besides charging higher prices these ticketing service companies have also imposed additional restrictions on transferability for these types of tickets such as requiring customers to pick up these tickets at willcall with the purchasing credit card to the extent that event tickets issued in this manner cannot be resold on our websites or to the extent that we are otherwise unable to effectively compete with these competitors our tickets business would be harmed pursuant to commercial arrangements with certain of its partners stubhub provides some of its sellers with the ability to conduct integrated resale transactions which consumers may prefer due to among other factors quicker delivery and lower fraud concerns these integrations are largely dealdependent and these arrangements may not be renewed on favorable terms or at allour stubhub business receives funds directly from buyers for tickets purchased from sellers and subsequently pays the sellers upon shipment of the tickets intermediation of transactions between buyers and sellers could potentially subject stubhub to licensure requirements laws and regulatory oversight in certain jurisdictions which may harm our ticket businesswe depend on key personnel our future performance depends substantially on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel including key engineering and product development personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel competition for key personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley where our corporate headquarters are located and we may be unable to successfully attract integrate or retain sufficiently qualified key personnel in making employment decisions particularly in the internet and hightechnology industries job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they would receive in connection with their employment fluctuations in our stock price may make it more difficult to attract retain and motivate employees in addition we do not have longterm employment agreements with any of our key personnel and do not maintain any key person life insurance policies further some members of our senior management team have fully vested the vast majority of their inthemoney equity incentives the loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel or our inability to attract key personnel could harm our business 44problems with or price increases by third parties who provide services to us or to our users could harm our business a number of parties provide services to us or to our users that benefit us such services include seller tools that automate and manage listings merchant tools that manage listings and interface with inventory management software storefronts that help our users list items caching services that make our sites load faster and shipping providers that deliver goods sold on our platform among others in some cases we have contractual agreements with these companies that give us a direct financial interest in their success while in other cases we have none paypal is dependent on the processing companies and banks that link paypal to the payment card and bank clearing networks to process transactions as described under the risk factor caption entitled changes to payment card networks or bank fees rules or practices could harm our payments business paypal is subject to among other things increases in interchange fees and assessments that payment card networks such as visa and mastercard charge for each transaction using one of their cards which paypals payment card processors have the right to pass on to paypal as well as changes in payment card network operating rules including special operating rules for internet payment services with which paypal is required by its payment card processors to comply similarly bill me later relies on unaffiliated lenders in providing the bill me later service and also relies heavily on third parties to operate its services including merchant processors and payment gateways to process transactions in addition our enterprise business utilizes unaffiliated payment processing companies to process transactions on the websites operated by enterprise clients third parties to provide underlying components of its ecommerce platform third party carriers to ship packages to customers of enterprise clients and third parties in its operations business to perform services during peak order volume periods financial or regulatory issues labor issues eg strikes lockouts or work stoppages or other problems that prevent these companies from providing services to us or our users could reduce the number of listings on our sites make it more difficult for users to complete transactions on our websites and mobile platforms or adversely affect enterprises ability to timely fulfill and ship products sold on the websites operated by its clients which would harm our businessprice increases by or service terminations disruptions or interruptions at companies that provide services to our users and clients such as postal and delivery services as well as our global shipping platform intended to facilitate crossborder transactions between buyers and sellers could also reduce the number of listings on our websites or make it more difficult for our sellers to complete transactions or for us to timely fulfill and ship products sold on the websites operated by enterprise clients thereby harming our business some third parties who provide services to us may have or gain market power and be able to increase their prices to us without competitive constraint in addition the us postal service which is facing ongoing fiscal challenges has instituted postal rate increases and announced that it is considering closing thousands of local post offices and ending saturday mail delivery while we continue to work with global carriers to offer our sellers a variety of shipping options and to enhance our shipping experience postal rate increases may reduce the competitiveness of certain sellers offerings and postal service changes could require certain sellers to utilize alternatives which could be more expensive or inconvenient which could in turn decrease the velocity of trade on our site thereby harming our business for example we believe that recent increases in international postal rates by the us postal service may have reduced crossborder trade by us sellers any security breach at a company providing services to our users could also adversely affect our customers and harm our business we have outsourced certain functions to thirdparty providers including some customer support and product development functions which are critical to our operations if our service providers do not perform satisfactorily our operations could be disrupted which could result in user dissatisfaction and adversely affect our velocity of trade business reputation and operating results although we generally have been able to renew or extend the terms of contractual arrangements with or if necessary replace third parties who provide services to us on acceptable terms there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future if any third parties were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms including as a result of bankruptcy due to poor economic conditions we may be unable to procure alternatives from other third parties in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms or at all in addition there can be no assurance that third parties who provide services directly to our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms or at all customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support or antifraud measures could diminish use of our services customer complaints or negative publicity about our customer support could severely diminish consumer confidence in and use of our services measures that we sometimes take to combat risks of fraud and breaches of privacy and security have the potential to damage relations with our customers or decrease activity on our websites by making our websites more difficult to use or restricting the activities of certain users these measures heighten the need for prompt and accurate customer support to resolve irregularities and disputes effective customer support requires significant personnel expense and if not managed properly this expense could significantly impact our profitability failure to manage or train our own or outsourced customer support representatives properly could compromise our ability to handle customer complaints effectively negative publicity 45about or negative experiences with customer support for any of our businesses could cause our reputation to suffer or affect consumer confidence in our brands individually or as a whole because paypal is providing a financial service and operating in a more regulated environment paypal must provide both telephone and email customer support and resolve certain customer contacts within shorter time frames as part of paypals program to reduce fraud losses and prevent money laundering and terrorist financing paypal may temporarily restrict the ability of customers to withdraw their funds if those funds or the customers account activity are identified by paypals risk models as suspicious paypal has in the past received negative publicity with respect to its customer support and account restrictions and has been the subject of purported class action lawsuits and state attorney general inquiries alleging among other things failure to resolve account restrictions promptly in the second quarter of 2010 two putative classaction lawsuits devinda fernando and vadim tsigel v paypal inc and moises zepeda v paypal inc were filed in the us district court for the northern district of california these lawsuits contain allegations that paypal improperly held users funds or otherwise improperly limited users accounts these lawsuits seek damages as well as changes to paypals practices among other remedies a determination that there have been violations of laws relating to paypals practices could expose paypal to significant liability any changes to paypals practices resulting from these lawsuits could require paypal to incur significant costs and to expend product resources which could delay other planned product launches or improvements and further harm our business also the consumer financial protection bureau has launched a complaints portal on its website that allows customers to file complaints against money transfer service providers including paypal and publishes information on such complaints if paypal is unable to provide quality customer support operations in a costeffective manner paypals users may have negative experiences paypal may receive additional negative publicity its ability to attract new customers may be damaged and it could become subject to additional litigation as a result current and future revenues could suffer losses could be incurred and its operating margins may decreaseour industries are intensely competitive across our businesses the industries in which we compete are characterized by dynamic and rapid technological change many and different business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants we often compete across a range of industries with platform businesses such as apple google and facebook many of whom are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position in other industries and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer as online and offline commerce increasingly converge the pace of change innovation and disruption is increasingmarketplaces our marketplaces businesses currently and potentially compete with a wide variety of online and offline companies providing goods and services to consumers and merchants the internet and mobile networks provide new rapidly evolving and intensely competitive channels for the sale of all types of goods and services our marketplaces businesses compete in twosided markets and must attract both buyers and sellers to use our platforms consumers who purchase or sell goods and services through our marketplaces businesses have more and more alternatives and merchants have more channels to reach consumers we expect competition to continue to intensify online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other the barriers to entry into these channels can be low and businesses easily can launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications at nominal cost by using commercially available software or partnering with any of a number of successful ecommerce companies in addition our marketplaces businesses face increased competitive pressure online and offline in particular the competitive norm for and the expected level of service from internet ecommerce and mobile commerce has significantly increased due to among other factors improved user experience greater ease of buying goods lower or no shipping costs faster shipping times and more favorable return policies also certain platform businesses such as apple google and facebook many of whom are larger than we are have a dominant and secure position in other industries and offer other goods and services to consumers and merchants which we do not offer if we are unable to change our products offerings and services in ways that reflect the changing demands of the internet ecommerce and mobile commerce marketplaces particularly the higher growth of sales of fixedprice items and higher expected service levels some of which depend on services provided by sellers on our platforms or compete effectively with larger platform businesses our business will suffer consumers who might use our site to buy goods have a wide variety of alternatives including the vast majority of traditional department warehouse boutique discount and general merchandise stores as well as the online and mobile operations of these traditional retailers online retailers and their related mobile offerings online and offline classified services and other shopping channels such as offline and online home shopping networks in the us these include walmart target sears macys jc penney costco office depot staples officemax sams club amazoncom which continues to expand into new geographies and lines of business buycom owned by rakuten yahoo shopping msn qvc and home shopping 46network among others in addition consumers have a large number of online and offline channels focused on one or more of the categories of products offered on our siteconsumers also can turn to many companies that offer a variety of services that provide other channels for buyers to find and buy items from sellers of all sizes including online aggregation and classifieds websites such as craigslist in which we own a minority equity stake oodlecom and a number of international websites operated by schibsted asa consumers also can turn to shoppingcomparison sites such as google shopping and bing shopping in certain markets our fixedprice listing and traditional auctionstyle listing formats increasingly are being challenged by other formats such as classifieds our classifieds websites including den blå avis bilbasen ebay classifieds including ebay anuncios ebay kleinanzeigen and ebay annunci gumtree kijiji loquo marktplaatsnl mobilede and alamaula offer classifieds listings in the us and a variety of local international markets in many markets in which they operate including in the us our classified platforms compete against more established online and offline classifieds platforms our online shopping comparison websites shoppingcom compete with sites such as google shopping bing shopping buycom nextagcom pricegrabbercom shopzilla buscapé in latin america owned by naspers and yahoo product search which offer shopping search engines that allow consumers to search the internet for specified products in addition sellers are increasingly utilizing multiple sales channels including the acquisition of new customers by paying for searchrelated advertisements on horizontal search engine sites such as bing google yahoo naver and baidu we use product search engines and paid search advertising to help users find our sites but these services also have the potential to divert users to other online shopping destinations consumers may choose to search for products and services with a horizontal search engine instead of our sites and horizontal search engines may send users to other shopping destinations instead of our sites consumers and merchants who might use our sites to sell goods also have many alternatives including general online ecommerce sites such as amazon and more specialized sites such as etsy our international sites also compete for sellers with general online ecommerce sites such as amazon rakutende quelle and otto in germany leboncoinfr and priceminister owned by rakuten in france taobao marketplace and taobao mall in china tradus owned by naspers in poland yahookimo in taiwan lotte naver and 11th street in south korea trading post quicksales in australia and amazon and playcom owned by rakuten in the united kingdom and other countries and alibaba and aliexpress owned by alibaba in russia brazil and certain less developed markets our sellers may choose to sell their goods through other channels such as classifieds sites consumers and merchants also can create and sell through their own sites and may choose to purchase online advertising instead of using our services in some countries there are online sites that have larger customer bases and greater brand recognition than we do as well as competitors that may have a better understanding of local culture and commerce than we do as our businesses in developing countries grow we increasingly may compete with domestic competitors that have advantages we do not possess such as a greater ability to operate under local regulatory authorities the principal competitive factors for marketplaces include the following ability to attract retain and engage buyers and sellersvolume of transactions and price and selection of goodstrust in the seller and the transactioncustomer service andbrand recognitionwith respect to our online and mobile competition additional competitive factors include community cohesion interaction and sizewebsite or mobile platform and application easeofuse and accessibilityuser engagementsystem reliabilityreliability of delivery and paymentlevel of service fees andquality of search toolswe may be unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors some current and potential competitors have longer operating histories larger customer bases and greater brand recognition in other business and internet sectors than we do other online ecommerce sites may be acquired by receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with wellestablished and wellfinanced companies as a result some of our competitors with other revenue 47sources may be able to devote more resources to marketing and promotional campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote more resources to website mobile platforms and applications and systems development than we can some of our competitors may offer or continue to offer free shipping favorable return policies or other transactionrelated services which improve the user experience on their sites and which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match our competitors may be able to innovate faster than we can and new technologies may further increase the competitive pressures by enabling our competitors to offer more efficient or lowercost services our competitors may be able to use the advantages of brickandmortar stores or other sorts of physical presencein addition certain manufacturers may limit or cease distribution of their products through online channels such as ebay manufacturers may attempt to use existing or future government regulation to prohibit or limit online commerce in certain categories of goods or services manufacturers may also attempt to enforce minimum resale price maintenance or minimum advertised price arrangements to prevent distributors from selling on our websites or on the internet generally or at prices that would make our website attractive relative to other alternatives for example in june 2012 adidas group announced that it intends to restrict its dealers on a global basis from listing and selling adidas and reebok products on sites including ebaycom and nike inc and asics corp have taken steps to similarly restrict internet sales of their products on platform sites such as ebaycom the adoption by manufacturers of policies or the adoption of new laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations by government authorities in each case discouraging or restricting the sales of goods or services over the internet could force our users to stop selling certain products on our websites increased competition or antiinternet distribution policies or regulations may result in reduced operating margins loss of market share and diminished value of our brands as we respond to changes in the competitive environment we may from time to time make pricing service or marketing decisions or acquisitions that may be controversial with and lead to dissatisfaction among some of our sellers which could reduce activity on our websites and harm our profitability although we receive internet traffic from several large online services and search engine providers these arrangements may not continue on favorable terms or these companies may decide to promote competitive services in any event such arrangements may not result in increased usage of our sites in addition companies that control user access to transactions through network access internet browsers mobile networks mobile operating systems or search engines could promote our competitors channel current or potential users to their vertically integrated electronic commerce sites or their advertisers sites attempt to restrict access to our sites or charge us substantial fees for inclusion for example google increasingly may steer its users to its own sites adversely affecting traffic to our sites search engines increasingly are becoming a starting point for online shopping and as the costs of operating an online store continue to decline online sellers may increasingly sell goods through multiple channels which could reduce the number and value of transactions these sellers conduct through our sites paypal the markets for paypals products and services are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change including but not limited to mobile payments electronic funds transfer networks allowing internet access crossborder access to payment networks creation of new payment networks and new technologies for enabling merchants both online and offline to process payments more simply paypal faces competition and potential competition from existing online mobile and offline payment methods including among othersproviders of traditional payment methods particularly credit and debit cards checks money orders and automated clearing house transactions these providers are primarily wellestablished banksproviders of digital wallets which offer customers the ability to pay online or on mobile devices through a variety of payment methods including visas vme mastercards masterpass american expresss serve google wallet and the merchant customer exchange mcx initiative supported by walmart target and other

services that provide special offers linked to a specific payment provider such as visas rightcliq mastercard marketplace trialpay and tapjoy services such as coinbase and bitpay that help merchants accept and manage virtual currencies such as bitcoin andcashsome of these competitors have longer operating histories significantly greater financial technical marketing customer service and other resources greater brand recognition or a larger base of customers than paypal and may be also be able to leverage other affiliated businesses for competitive advantage paypals competitors may be able to innovate and respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements faster and more effectively than paypal some of these competitors may also be subject to less burdensome licensing antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing and other regulatory requirements than paypal which is subject to additional regulations based on among other factors its licensure as a bank in luxembourg they may devote greater resources to the development promotion and sale of products and services than paypal and they may offer lower prices for example google previously has offered free payments processing on transactions in amounts proportionate to certain advertising spending with google we also expect new entrants such as mcx to offer competitive products and services in addition some merchants provide such services to themselves competing services tied to established banks and other financial institutions may offer greater liquidity and engender greater consumer confidence in the safety and efficacy of their services than paypal in addition in certain countries such as germany netherlands and australia electronic funds transfer is a leading method of payment for both online and offline transactions in the uk the payments council has announced that mobile payments between bank accounts will be broadly available beginning in 2014 as in the us established banks and other financial institutions that do not currently offer online payments could quickly and easily develop such a service the principal competitive factors for paypal include the followingability to attract retain and engage both buyers and sellers with relatively low marketing expenseability to show that sellers will achieve incremental sales by offering paypalsecurity of transactions and the ability for buyers to use paypal without sharing their financial information with the sellerlow fees and simplicity of fee structureability to develop services across multiple commerce channels including mobile payments and payments at the physical point of saletrust in paypals dispute resolution and buyer and seller protection programscustomer service andbrand recognition49with respect to our online and mobile competition additional competitive factors include website and mobile platform and application onboarding easeofuse and accessibilitysystem reliabilitydata security ease and quality of integration into thirdparty mobile applications andquality of developer tools such as our application programming interfaces and software development kits some of paypals competitors such as wells fargo first data and american express also provide processing services to paypal if paypal were to seek to expand the financial products that it offers either alone or through a commercial alliance or an acquisition these processing relationships could be negatively affected or these competitors and other processors could make it more difficult for paypal to deliver its services enterpriseour enterprise business provides our suite of commerce technologies omnichannel operations capabilities and marketing solutions that enable companies to operate and integrate their ecommerce offering into their omnichannel business the market for such products and services is continuously evolving and intensely competitive many of our prospective clients evaluate managing all or some aspects of an omnichannel business with internal resources as a result we often compete with inhouse solutions promoted and supported by internal information technology staffs marketing departments merchandising groups and other internal corporate constituencies as well as with external technology and interactive marketing service providers that supply one or more components that allow prospective clients to develop and operate their omnichannel business inhouse this group of providers may include the prospective client itself and companies that offer web platforms eg art technology group owned by oracle ibm amazon demandware marketlive and microsoft customer carecall center services eg west communications amazon sykes enterprises and convergys fulfillment and logistics eg pfs web amazon innotrac dhl and ups and systems integrators and technology providers eg accenture eds sapient infosys oracle and ibm email management and data aggregation eg experian hartehanks and epsilon online marketing and design services digital marketing services agencies such as omnicom group wpp group publicis and the interpublic group of companies and other interactive marketing services eg google linkshare owned by rakuten tradedoubler adobe and valueclick low barriers to entry in the interactive marketing industry could also increase the number of competitors we may face we believe that we compete primarily on the basis of the following offering the choice of a complete integrated solution or a componentbased solutionpromoting the clients brand and business rather than our ownproviding scale and operating leverage with an enterprise focusestablishing a commitment to invest in and enhance our platform aligning our financial interests with those of our clientsoffering digital marketing solutions that are integrated with our suite of commerce technologies which we believe provides a more strategic cohesive and optimized approach to growing ecommerce businesses andproviding services that utilize proprietary technology to promote stronger customer engagement designed to increase clients return on investmentour enterprise business has competitors with longer operating histories larger customer bases greater brand recognition and greater financial marketing and other resources those competitors may be able to secure components of their technology and services on more favorable terms and devote more resources to technology development and marketing than our enterprise business in addition as we expand our business internationally we will face increased competition from global and local companies which may have a greater understanding of and focus on the local customer lastly as our current and prospective clients seek a larger global presence and target new markets abroad we will increasingly compete with ecommerce services competitors on the basis of our international solutions50we are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition lawswe are subject to scrutiny by various government agencies under us and foreign regulations including competition laws some jurisdictions also provide private rights of action for competitors or consumers to assert claims of anticompetitive conduct other companies and government agencies have in the past and may in the future allege that our actions violate the antitrust or competition laws of the us individual states the european commission or other countries or otherwise constitute unfair competition contractual agreements with buyers sellers or other companies could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation also our unilateral business practices could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulators particularly those outside of the us may perceive our business to have so much market power that otherwise uncontroversial business practices could be deemed anticompetitive for example in the us we have been sued by a plaintiff representing a putative class of sellers who alleges that we have illegally monopolized a market for online auctions in korea the national competition authority investigated allegations that we have engaged in illegal exclusive conduct and rendered a decision against us in october 2010 both the main case and a related administrative action were resolved in our favor the competition authorities in germany and australia have conducted investigations now completed of various actions taken by our businesses such claims and investigations even if without foundation typically are very expensive to defend involve negative publicity and substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in significant judgments against us or require us to change our business practices in several jurisdictions we have taken actions designed to improve the security of transactions and the quality of the user experience on our websites and mobile platforms for example beginning in june 2008 we have required users in the uk to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized uk site and since october 2008 we have required sellers on ebaycom to accept one or more accepted payment methods currently paypal credit or debit cards processed through internet merchant accounts propay and skrill formerly known as moneybookers and no longer allow any forms of paper payment including checks and money orders to be listed by sellers in the us for most categories of items while these initiatives are intended to improve and make safer our users buying experience andor increase activity on our sites certain users may be negatively affected by or react negatively to these changes and may allege that we have and are abusing market power we have faced inquiries from government regulators in various jurisdictions related to such actions such as in 2008 both the australian competition and consumer commission and the reserve bank of australia reviewed our policies requiring sellers to offer paypal as a payment alternative on most transactions on our localized australian website and precluding sellers from imposing a surcharge or any other fee for accepting paypal or other payment methods we may face similar inquiries from other government regulators in the future negative reactions to these changes by our users or government authorities could among other things force us to change our operating practices in ways that could harm our business operating results and profitabilityour business may be adversely affected by factors that cause our users to spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications including geopolitical events natural disasters seasonal factors and increased usage of other websites our users may spend less time on our websites or mobile platforms and applications as a result of a variety of diversions including geopolitical events such as war the threat of war or terrorist activity natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes increased use of social networking or other entertainment websites or mobile platforms and applications which may decrease the amount of time users spend on our websites or mobile platforms and applications and seasonal fluctuations due to a variety of factors such as decreased activity on our websites caused by the onset of good weather during the summer months and national holidays or increased activity during the holiday season anything that diverts our users from their customary level of usage of our websites mobile platforms or applications could adversely affect our business51our failure to costeffectively manage the expansion of our headcount facilities and infrastructure in the us and internationally could harm our business we have expanded significantly our headcount facilities and infrastructure in the us and internationally and anticipate that further expansion in certain areas and geographies will be required for some of our businesses we are also increasing our product and service offerings across our businesses this expansion increases the complexity of our businesses and places a significant strain on our management operational and financial resources the areas of our business that are put under strain by our growth include the followingtechnology platforms we continue to focus on upgrading and developing our systems and infrastructure to accommodate the growth of our businesses and to improve the functionality and reliability of our websites and services at a reasonable cost while maintaining uninterrupted 247 operations risks associated with our failure to do so are described under the captions if we are unable to costeffectively upgrade and expand our websites services and platforms our business would suffer and systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites applications products or services could harm our businesscustomer account billing our revenues depend on prompt and accurate billing processes our failure to grow our transactionprocessing capabilities to accommodate the increasing number of transactions that must be billed on our and our subsidiaries websites would harm our business and our ability to collect revenuecustomer service we continue to focus on providing better and more efficient customer support to our users we intend to provide an increased level of support including an increasing amount of telephone support and supporting an increasing number of languages in a costeffective manner if we are unable to provide customer support in a costeffective manner users of our products and services may have negative experiences current and future revenues could suffer our costs may increase and our operating margins may decreaseinternal infrastructure our current and planned personnel systems procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations to effectively manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel we will need to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls this is a special challenge as we acquire new operations with different and incompatible systems any capital investments that we may make will increase our cost base which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by expense reductions in the short term failure to implement these improvements could limit our ability to manage our growth and adversely affect our operating results also we must continue to effectively hire train and manage new employees if our new hires perform poorly if we are unsuccessful in hiring training managing and integrating new employees or if we are unsuccessful in retaining our existing employees our business may be harmedwe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilitiesthe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation and significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain like many other multinational corporations we are subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate our determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by applicable domestic and foreign tax authorities and we are currently undergoing a number of investigations audits and reviews by taxing authorities throughout the world including with respect to our tax structure governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues which has contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stances taken by tax authorities any adverse outcome of any such audit or review could have a negative effect on our business operating results and financial condition and the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made while we have established reserves based on assumptions and estimates that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventualities these reserves may prove to be insufficient in the event that any taxing authority is successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our positions in light of serious ongoing fiscal challenges in the us and many countries in europe various levels of government are also increasingly focused on tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue including corporate income taxes for example the economic downturn reduced tax revenues for us federal and state governments and a number of proposals to increase taxes from corporate entities have been implemented or are being considered at various levels of government among the options have been a range of proposals included in the tax and budget policies recommended to the us congress by the us department of the treasury to modify the federal tax rules related to the imposition of us federal corporate income taxes for companies operating in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions if such proposals are enacted into law this 52could increase our effective tax rate a number of us states have likewise attempted to increase corporate tax revenues by taking an expansive view of corporate presence to attempt to impose corporate income taxes and other direct business taxes on companies that have no physical presence in their state and taxing authorities in foreign jurisdictions may take similar actions many us states are also altering their apportionment formulas to increase the amount of taxable incomeloss attributable to their state from certain outofstate businesses companies that operate over the internet such as ebay are a target of some of these efforts if more taxing authorities are successful in applying direct taxes to internet companies that do not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction this could increase our effective tax rateour developer platforms which are open to merchants and thirdparty developers subject us to additional risks in 2009 we launched the paypal developer platform to enable thirdparty developers to access a wide variety of paypal product and programming code specifications and to connect to select paypal payment application programming interfaces apis we also began providing a software development kit sdk for building mobile payments applications and enabling thirdparty developers to access certain apis with respect to our marketplaces platforms in august 2011 we acquired magento inc now xcommerce inc which includes an open platform for merchants and developers in march 2013 we announced enhanced sdks and api tools for the paypal platform with a particular focus on developers of mobile applications there can be no assurance that merchants or thirdparty developers will develop and maintain applications and services on our open platforms on a timely basis or at all and a number of factors could cause such thirdparty developers to curtail or stop development for our platforms in addition our business is subject to many regulatory restrictions it is possible that merchants and thirdparty developers who utilize our development platforms apis and sdks could violate these regulatory restrictions and we may be held responsible for such violations which could adversely affect our business there are risks associated with our indebtedness as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 41 billion of senior unsecured indebtedness and no indebtedness outstanding under our 20 billion commercial paper program although from time to time we have made substantial borrowings under our commercial paper program and may do so in the future we also have a 30 billion revolving credit facility under which we maintain 20 billion of available borrowing capacity in order to repay commercial paper borrowings in the event we are unable to repay those borrowings from other sources when they come due as of december 31 2013 no borrowings or letters of credit were outstanding under this revolving credit facility and accordingly 10 billion of borrowing capacity was available for other purposes permitted by this credit facilitywe may incur additional indebtedness in the future including under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility or through public or private offerings of debt securities our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequences including without limitation any of the following we will be required to use cash reserves to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtednessour indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions as well as to competitive pressureadverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies will likely increase our borrowing costsour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions share repurchases or for general corporate and other purposes may be limited andour flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry may be limitedour ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic conditions industry cycles and financial business and other factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other things repatriate funds to the us at substantial tax costseek additional financing in the debt or equity marketsrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtednesssell selected assets orreduce or delay planned capital or operating expendituressuch measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt in addition any such financing refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all 53we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rightswe believe the protection of our intellectual property including our trademarks particularly those covering the ebay and paypal names patents copyrights domain names trade dress and trade secrets is critical to our success we aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal state and common law rights in the us and internationally as well as a variety of administrative procedures for example we pursue the registration of our domain names trademarks and service marks in the us and internationally additionally we have filed us and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology we also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights when offering or procuring products and services we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary and confidential information however effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are made available and contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our technology or deter independent development of equivalent or superior technologies or other intellectual property rights by others in addition trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is very expensive to maintain and may require litigation we must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every jurisdiction also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights and we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to others these licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or significant costs incurred in doing so could materially harm our business we depend on the continued growth of online and mobile commerce to acquire new users the business of selling goods online and through mobile networks is dynamic and in the case of mobile networks relatively new concerns about fraud privacy and other problems may discourage additional consumers from adopting the internet or mobile devices as modes of commerce or may prompt consumers to offline channels in countries such as the us germany australia korea and the uk where our services and online commerce generally have been available for some time and the level of market penetration of our services is high acquiring new users for our services may be more difficult and costly than it has been in the past moreover the growth rates of internet users are slowing in many countries where we have a significant presence in order to expand our user base we must appeal to and acquire consumers who historically have used traditional means of commerce to purchase goods andor may prefer internet analogues to such traditional retail means such as the retailers own website to our offerings in addition these consumers may prove to be less active than our current users due to lower levels of willingness to use the internet or mobile devices for commerce for reasons such as lack of access to highspeed communications equipment congestion of traffic on the internet internet or mobile network outages or delays disruptions or other damage to users computers or mobile devices if the growth of online and mobile commerce slows and we are unable to gain new users our business could be adversely impacted our businesses depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by our users as well as access to mobile networks internet service providers and mobile network operators may be able to block degrade or charge us or our users additional fees for our offerings which could harm our business our users rely on access to the internet or mobile networks to use our products and services in many cases that access is provided by companies that compete with at least some of our offerings including incumbent telephone companies cable companies mobile communications companies and large internet service providers some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of customers use of our offerings by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on our ability to offer our mobile applications in their mobile application stores internet service providers or mobile network operators could attempt to charge us each time our customers use our offerings worldwide a number of companies have announced plans to take such actions or are selling products designed to facilitate such actions the united states federal communications commission fcc enacted rules in december 2010 preserving the open internet broadband industry practices fcc10201 establishing baseline restrictions that would regulate the ability of internet access companies to interfere with internet traffic transported over wired and wireless networks the new rules were challenged in court and the dc circuit court of appeals released a ruling on january 14 2013 affirming the fccs jurisdiction over internet access 54services but rejecting aspects of the fcc rules that the court interpreted as applying common carriertype obligations to internet broadband providers the fcc announced its intent to appeal the decision and could pursue alternative rulemaking as well pending greater regulatory and judicial clarity any interference with our offerings or higher charges for access to our offerings whether paid by us or by our customers could cause us to lose existing customers impair our ability to attract new customers and harm our revenue and growth our business depends on the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure the success of our services depends on the maintenance and security of the internet infrastructure problems caused by viruses worms malware and similar programs may require considerable resources to correct and could harm the performance of the internet over a short or long period of time in addition hackers pose an increasing threat to the security of online and mobile commerce also the internet has experienced and is likely to continue to experience a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure any threats to the maintenance and security of the internet could adversely impact our business  we are subject to the risks of owning real property we own real property including land and buildings related to our operations ownership of this real property subjects us to a number of additional risks including the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with fixing any environmental problemsdisruptions to our operations resulting from possible natural disasters interruptions in utilities and similar eventsadverse changes in the value of these properties due to interest rate changes changes in the commercial property markets or other factorsthe possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning seismic disability law or other requirements andthe possibility of disputes with tenants neighboring owners or otherssome antitakeover provisions may affect the price of our common stock our board of directors has the authority to issue up to 10000000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock or take control of our board of directors these include provisions that provide for a classified board of directors through our annual meeting of stockholders in 2015 prohibit stockholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of stockholders to call special meetings we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder as defined by delaware law for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met this restriction could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control55
