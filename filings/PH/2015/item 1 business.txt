other environmental laws the company is subject to the united states federal superfund law under which the company has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites some of which are on the united states environmental protection agencys superfund priority listas of june 30 2015 the company was involved in environmental remediation at various united states and nonus manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the company and as a potentially responsible party along with other companies at offsite waste disposal facilities and regional sitesthe company believes that its policies practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the company compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past and the company believes will not have in the future a material adverse effect on the capital expenditures earnings or competitive position of the companyas of june 30 2015 the company had a reserve of 170 million for environmental matters that were probable and reasonably estimable this reserve was recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the companys liability in proportion to other responsible partiesthe companys estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of 170 million to a maximum of 802 million the largest range of the estimated total liability for any one site is approximately 84 million the actual costs to be incurred by the company will be dependent on final determination of contamination and required remedial action negotiations with governmental authorities with respect to cleanup levels changes in regulatory requirements innovations in investigatory and remedial technologies effectiveness of remedial technologies employed the ability of the other responsible parties to pay and any insurance or other thirdparty recoveries 7 energy matters and sources and availability of raw materialsthe companys
