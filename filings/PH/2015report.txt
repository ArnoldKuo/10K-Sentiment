distributors customers and suppliers and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors customers and suppliers operate among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing and other endmarket activity currency exchange rates air travel trends difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact the level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the companys revenues operating profits margins and order ratesthe company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels engaging in various business realignment initiatives maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash the company

venturesthe company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services and entering into joint ventures which it believes will enhance its operations and profitability however there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or joint venture opportunities or that it will be able to acquire such businesses or enter into such joint ventures on acceptable terms in addition there is no assurance that the company will be able to avoid acquiring or assuming unexpected liabilities that the company will be able to integrate successfully any businesses that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses or joint ventures will be profitable the

suffer which could materially adversely affect the companys results of operationsthe company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologiesthe markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the companys ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources if the company does not develop or has difficulties or delays in the development of innovative new and enhanced products and services or fails to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies the companys revenues may be materially reduced and the companys competitive position could be materially adversely affected in addition the company may invest in research and development of products and services or in acquisitions or other investments that do not lead to significant revenue which could adversely affect our profitabilitythe company may be subject to risks arising from price and supply fluctuations in raw materials used in the companys production processes and by its suppliers of component partsthe companys supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons including availability and pricing prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the companys ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factors which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flowsthe companys suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the companys results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedthe company may be subject to risks arising from changes in the competitive environment in which it operatesthe companys operations are subject to competition from a wide variety of global regional and local competitors which could adversely affect the companys results of operations by creating

result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in overall profitability changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws in addition the amount of income taxes paid by the company is subject to ongoing audits by united states federal state and local tax authorities and by nonus tax authorities if these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the companys tax liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operationsthe company may be subject to product liability risksthe companys businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design manufacture and sale of its products and the products of thirdparty vendors that the company uses or resells significant product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations although the company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilitiesthe company may

furthermore as required by us generally accepted accounting principles the company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies including contingencies related to legal claims asserted against it subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect the companys assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the company to make payments in excess of our reserves which could have an adverse effect on the companys results of operationsthe company is subject to national and international laws and regulations such as the anticorruption laws of the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act relating to its business and its employees despite the companys policies procedures and compliance programs its internal controls

property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the company may be unable to maintain renew or enter into new license agreements with thirdparty owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms in addition the global nature of the companys business increases the risk that the companys intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use by others in some cases the companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped unauthorized use of the companys intellectual property rights or the companys inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the companys competitive

superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund lawin addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the companys business operations or financial resultsthe company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial conditionthe company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefitsthe funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the companys defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely
