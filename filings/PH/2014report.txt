an adverse effect on the business results of operations and financial condition of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the company and its distributors customers and suppliers operate among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing activity air travel trends currency exchange rates difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact the level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the companys revenues operating profits margins and order ratesthe company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels maintaining a strong balance sheet and

companys results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the companys ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factorsthe companys suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the companys results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedthe company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint venturesthe company

manufacturing and distribution capability delivery price competitiveness and customer service the company may be subject to risks relating to its nonus operationsthe companys net sales derived from customers outside the united states were approximately 44 in each of fiscal 2014 and 2013 and 45 in fiscal 2012 in addition many of the companys manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the united states the company expects net sales from nonus markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales the companys nonus operations are subject to risks in addition to those facing its domestic operations includingfluctuations in currency exchange rateslimitations on ownership and on repatriation of earningstransportation delays and interruptionspolitical social and economic instability and disruptionsgovernment embargoes or trade restrictionsthe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriersimport and export controlslabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environmentsthe potential for nationalization of enterprises 10 difficulties in staffing and managing multinational operationslimitations on the companys ability to enforce legal rights and remediespotentially adverse tax consequences anddifficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basisif the company is unable to

company may be subject to risks relating to the development of new products and technologiesthe markets in which the company operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services the companys ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources difficulties or delays in research development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market or regulatory acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce revenues and materially adversely affect the companys competitive positionthe company may be subject to risks relating to the preservation of its intellectual propertyprotecting the companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts the company owns a number of patents trade secrets copyrights trademarks trade names and other forms of intellectual property

the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund lawin addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the companys business operations or financial resultsthe company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial conditionthe company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefitsthe funding requirements and the amount of expenses recorded for the companys defined benefit pension plans are dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets which are dependent on actual plan asset returns significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact the companys results of
