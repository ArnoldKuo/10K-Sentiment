industries and markets in which the company and its distributors customers and suppliers operate among the economic factors which may have such an effect are manufacturing activity air travel trends currency exchange rates difficulties entering new markets and general economic conditions such as inflation deflation interest rates and credit availability these factors may among other things negatively impact the level of purchases capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the company and its distributors customers and suppliers and therefore the companys revenues operating profits margins and order ratesthe company has remained focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels maintaining a strong balance sheet and

for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the companys results of operations and profit margins although the company generally attempts to manage these fluctuations by among other things passing along increased raw material prices to its customers in the form of price increases there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the companys ability to increase the price of its products or the company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure contract terms or other factorsthe companys suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts as a result the company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs consequently the companys results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affectedthe company may be subject to risks relating to acquisitions and joint venturesthe company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary

environmental protection agencys superfund priority list the company could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws including the superfund lawin addition increased worldwide focus on climate change issues has led to recent legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions including regulation of such emissions through a capandtrade system globally regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes concerns could subject the company to additional costs and restrictions including increased energy and raw material costs until definitive regulations are adopted the company is not able to predict how such regulations would affect the companys business operations or financial resultsthe company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future if more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future these laws could have a material adverse effect on the companys business results of operations and financial conditionthe company may be subject to risks relating to increasing costs of certain employee and retiree
