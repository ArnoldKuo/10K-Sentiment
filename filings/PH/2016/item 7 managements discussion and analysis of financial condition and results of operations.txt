have offbalance sheet arrangementscritical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes the policies discussed below are considered by management to be more critical than other policies because their application places the most significant demands on managements judgmentrevenue recognition  substantially all of the diversified industrial segment revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product has shipped and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred or services have been rendered the price to the customer is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured which is generally at the time the product is shipped the aerospace systems segment recognizes revenues primarily using the percentageofcompletion method and the extent of progress toward completion is primarily measured using the unitsofdelivery method the company estimates costs to complete longterm contracts for purposes of evaluating and establishing contract reserves the estimation of these costs requires judgment on the part of management due to the duration of the contractual agreements as well as the technical nature of the products involved adjustments to cost estimates are made on a consistent basis and a contract reserve is established when the estimated costs to complete a contract exceed the expected contract revenues impairment of goodwill and longlived assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value for the company a reporting unit is one level below the operating segment level determining whether an impairment has occurred requires the valuation of the respective reporting unit which the company has consistently estimated using primarily a discounted cash flow model the company believes that the use of a discounted cash flow model 25table of contentsresults in the most accurate calculation of a reporting units fair value since the market value for a reporting unit is not readily available the discounted cash flow analysis requires several assumptions including future sales growth and operating margin levels as well as assumptions regarding future industry specific market conditions each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis the company has consistently used a discount rate commensurate with its cost of capital adjusted for inherent business risks and an appropriate terminal growth factor the company also reconciles the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units as derived from the discounted cash flow analysis to the companys overall market capitalization the results of the companys 2016 annual goodwill impairment test performed as of december 31 2015 indicated that no goodwill impairment existed during 2014 the company made a decision to restructure and change the strategic direction of its worldwide energy products division epd the company calculated the fair value of epd using assumptions reflecting the companys current strategic direction for this reporting unit the results of which indicated that the carrying value of epd exceeded its fair value as a result the company estimated the implied fair value of epds goodwill which resulted in a noncash impairment charge of 140 million the fair value of epd was calculated using both a discounted cash flow analysis and estimated fair market values of comparable businesses the company continually monitors its reporting units for impairment indicators and updates assumptions used in the most recent calculation of the fair value of a reporting unit as appropriate the company is unaware of any current market trends that are contrary to the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of any of its reporting units if actual experience is not consistent with the assumptions made in the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units especially assumptions regarding penetration into new markets and the recovery of the current economic environment it is possible that the estimated fair value of certain reporting units could fall below their carrying value resulting in the necessity to conduct additional goodwill impairment tests longlived assets held for use which primarily includes finitelived intangible assets and plant and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use over their expected useful lives and eventual disposition are less than their carrying value the longterm nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future and only takes into consideration technological advances known at the time of the impairment test during 2016 there were no events or circumstances that indicated that the carrying value of the companys longlived assets held for use were not recoverable during 2014 in connection with the goodwill impairment review discussed above the company determined certain intangible assets of epd primarily trademarks and customer lists and plant and equipment were impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 49 million the fair value of epds intangible assets and plant and equipment were determined using the income approach for each asset pensions  the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations related to the companys defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis this determination requires critical assumptions regarding the discount rate longterm rate of return on plan assets increases in compensation levels and amortization periods for actuarial gains and losses assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date changes in the assumptions to reflect actual experience as well as the amortization of actuarial gains and losses could result in a material change in the annual net periodic expense and benefit obligations reported in the financial statements beginning in 2017 the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs the new method uses the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligations to relevant cash outflows previously these costs were determined using a singleweighted average discount rate the change does not affect the measurement of the companys benefit obligations the new method provides a more precise measure of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the discrete spot yield curve rates and will be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of 2017 annual net periodic pension expense in 2017 is expected to be lower by approximately 33 million compared to the previous method annual net periodic postretirement cost is not expected to be materially differentfor the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan a 50 basis point change in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated to have a 12 million effect on annual pension expense and a 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate is estimated to increase annual pension expense by 31 million as of june 30 2016 1535 million of past years net actuarial losses related to the companys domestic qualified defined benefit plan are subject to amortization in the future these losses will generally be amortized over approximately eight years and will negatively affect earnings in the future actuarial gains experienced in future years will help reduce the effect of the actuarial loss amortization further information on pensions is provided in note
