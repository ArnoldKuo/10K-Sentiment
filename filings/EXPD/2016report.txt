employees that provide a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while expeditors has historically expanded through organic growth the company has also been open to growth through acquisition of or

the companys executive team those operational initiatives are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings per share growththe strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that the company can continue to differentiate itself from its competitorsthe company continues to be focused on growth based on four key strategic initiatives1ensure that every operating units baseline growth strategies for air ocean and customs services grow at the rate of each units ie district or region relevant market growth rate the companys transcon and distribution services are expected to maintain higher growth rates2align and integrate the companys europeanasian pacific and europeannorth americas interests to the same degree that its asian pacific and americas interests have historically been aligned this alignment is expected to result in additional growth in these markets beyond the baseline growth expectations3leverage the companys long and deeply entrenched presence in various asian export markets  as well as the reputation that expeditors has with the strategic carriers servicing those markets  to create a stronger asian import presence while concentrating and enhancing export capabilities in key strategic lanes particularly into and out of china and southeast asia this is expected to create additional product growth opportunities in those markets which have not historically been a particular focus for the company4expand market share growth and position in north america traditionally expeditors most strategic marketin addition the company also has implemented four enabling initiatives which while also strategic in scope are highly tactical in support of the main four strategic initiativesaalign information technology it resources to support global strategybrefine risk management functions to effectively manage barriers to address customers evolving requests related to terms and conditionscdevelop and align global procurement strategies to optimize and leverage total cost of ownership in support of global strategic initiativesdcreate an acquisition strategy that will identify and assess desirable acquisitions within a framework supported by expeditors traditional acquisition methodologies and philosophies historically the company has made acquisitions to obtain technology and specialized industry expertise that it did not have and that could be leveraged to benefit the entire network the company also has selectively acquired agents and on occasion key service providers globally consistent information systems built specifically for logisticsexpeditors has long believed it a competitive advantage to maintain a globally consistent it system designed and built by logistics professionals for logistics professionals the companys it systems were built on a foundation that dictated consistency and uniformity across the expeditors global network for scalability the companys systems were designed on a decentralized basis so that an interruption in one office or location would likely not debilitate the abilities of the entire network or even a significant subpart of the networkexpeditors it systems were designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of the companys own logistics industry professionals and own staff building and maintaining internal system capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that the company not outsource its core functions with information systems being one of those core functionsexpeditors is not dependent on third parties for upgrades or modifications to its systems whether to address company needs or those of its customers even as the company is constantly engaged in enhancing and improving its systems expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected system providing comprehensive visibility creates great efficiency and great value particularly in this era when the value of data and the ability to provide timely visibility to that data in a consistent and reliable format is increasingly importantorganic versus acquired growthas a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services expeditors has often concluded over the course of its history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition the companys two primary strategies for expansion are to open offices in response to client requests and to expand through jointventures with agents when the company has made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage and specialized industry expertise that it was lacking and that could be leveraged to benefit the companys entire network nevertheless despite its history of organic growth expeditors is not opposed to acquisitions and will continue to identify and assess desirable acquisitions 3tailored solutions and targeted marketingas a nonasset based organization expeditors has considerable flexibility in managing its customers supply chains because of its relationships with local suppliers and global air and ocean partners expeditors is able to provide each of its customers with routing and pricing expertise the companys logistics solutions are tailored to each of its customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer typically chooses a logistics company and services for whats being shipped the foreign shipper may also be involved in the selection process accordingly expeditors targets its marketing to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliersbecause expeditors is in the business of optimizing its customers supply chains the company focuses its marketing to reach professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and operations in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retentionleveraging global regional and local expertiseexpeditors staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling expeditors services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that this regional expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating the origin and destination of customer service and marketing activities and its incentivebased compensation program that rewards employees based on the performance of the operations they control have been important elements of the companys successwhat expeditors shipsthe goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment pharmaceutical products retail goods automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of company business the typical import customer includes retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers expeditors also has established industry vertical teams throughout its network to focus on aviation and aerospace healthcare oil and energy and retail and fashion historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of company net revenuesexpeditors services in detailthe following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors servicesairfreight servicesairfreight services accounted for approximately 41 percent of total company revenues and 34 percent of total net revenues in each of the last three years when performing airfreight services expeditors typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator expeditors purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment expeditors issues a house airway bill hawb to its customers as the contract of carriage and separately receives a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation expeditors receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent expeditors offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demandin its airfreight operations expeditors receives shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point expeditors or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinationsthe company estimates that its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or bothat the origin the company typically delivers shipments from one of its warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours from the point of origin during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist expeditors may charter aircrafts to meet customer demandexpeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment expeditors is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipmentexpeditors airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges the company and the rate that expeditors in turn charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services expeditors provides include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when expeditors acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customer 4expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with its service providers  the airlines because expeditors relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments its business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service although airline profitability has improved over the last two years many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products companies continue to decrease the size and weight of shipments and many of the companys customers focus on improving supplychain efficiency seek to reduce overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizie ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings for its customers the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilitydeclines in fuel prices did not significantly impact airfreight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 airfreight customers began to seek reductions in rates related to lower fuel prices and currently carriers are incorporating the lower fuel rates into their pricing structures there continues to be uncertainty as to how future buy rates will be impacted by continuing volatility in fuel prices due to a number of factors because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts the companys buy and sell rates expeditors would expect its airfreight revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the impact of changing fuel prices the company would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from any changes in fuel pricesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight services accounted for approximately 33 percent of the companys total revenues and 25 percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years the company operates expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order managementocean freight consolidation as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean the company issues a house ocean bill hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that the company may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws direct ocean forwarding when the customer contracts directly with the steamship line the company acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the steamship line and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements the company does not issue an hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs the company to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipperorder management order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and consolidating these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new ships which creates excess capacity this excess capacity causes most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityrecent declines in oil prices have been reflected in both the buy and sell rates for ocean freight via a surcharge known as the bunker adjustment factor this surcharge in the industry fluctuates with the cost of the bunker fuel and is added to base ocean freight charges the company would not expect an adverse effect on ocean freight net revenues resulting from changes in oil pricescustoms brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 26 percent of the companys total revenues and 41 percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years as a customs broker expeditors assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service expeditors provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles in its transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments handled by the company may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customer 5expeditors also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinite transportation services transcon and consulting services none of which are currently individually significant to the companys total revenues and net revenues expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services the companys whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projectscompetitionthe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areasthe primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between customers service providers and expeditors systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near realtime visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transitexpeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet its customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in its ongoing success the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that currently meet these customer demands management believes that the companys existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competesunlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitionsthe companys ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel expeditors believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide a distinct competitive advantagecurrency and dependence on service providersthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates that it transacts in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this exposes expeditors to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where expeditors maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations that influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agentsin addition the companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies expeditors considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect expeditors business in unpredictable waysseasonalityhistorically the companys operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can expeditors estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periodsenvironmentalin the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2016 6employeesat december 31 2015

required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in 2016 cbp is upgrading its system to the automated commercial environment ace expeditors is in the process of upgrading its systems to comply with the new ace requirements however there can be no assurance that there will not be resulting delays or disruptions in other jurisdictions in which the company performs customs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countries 8the company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to expeditors ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when expeditors encounters this sort of governmental restriction the company works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required licensethe continuing global threats from terrorism wars and governments overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents expeditors and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company believes that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the companys servicescargo liabilitywhen acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 special drawing rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline that the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper expeditors does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line that the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent the company does not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value generally 050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to expeditors in the same manner and to the same extent when providing warehousing and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per lot  which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability expeditors maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which the company is legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in its warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2015 was 5 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker through its subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and places insurance coverage for other customers 9item 1a  risk factorsrisk factors discussion and potential significance  international trade the company primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract the companys primary market and adversely impact its operating results for example international trade is influenced by    currency exchange rates and currency control regulations    interest rate fluctuations    changes in governmental policies such as taxation quota restrictions other forms of trade barriers andor restrictions and trade accords    changes in and application of international and domestic customs trade and security regulations    wars strikes civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts    changes in labor and other costs    natural disasters and pandemics    changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own   changes in availability of credit    changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleumrelated products and    increased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability  service providers as a nonasset based provider of global logistics services the company depends on a variety of assetbased service providers including air ocean and ground freight carriers the quality and profitability of the company depend upon effective selection management and discipline of service providers in recent years many of the companys service providers have incurred significant operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers and space allotment made available to the company by assetbased carriers could affect the company in unpredictable ways any combination of reduced carrier capacity pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules could negatively impact the companys ability to maintain historical profitability the companys carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on the companys business future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in transportation industries which in turn could increase the companys purchased transportation costs if the company is unable to pass such costs on to its customers its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected   predictability of results the company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting shortterm customer requirements however longterm customer satisfaction depends upon the companys ability to meet these unpredictable shortterm customer requirements personnel costs the companys single largest expense are always less flexible in the very near term as the company must staff to meet uncertain demand as a result shortterm operating results could be disproportionately affected a significant portion of the companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the companys revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the companys control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods product launches andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the companys stock  foreign operations the majority of the companys revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states to maintain a global service network the company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations in addition the company operates in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws rules regulations and decrees of the united states including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and of all other countries in which the company conducts business as well as trade and exchange control laws or laws regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions and antiboycott laws and regulations compliance with these laws rules regulations and decrees is dependent on the companys employees service providers agents third party brokers and customers whose individual actions could violate these laws rules regulations and decrees failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses damage to the companys reputation and restrictions on its ability to conduct business 10risk factors discussion and potential significance  key personnel the company is a service business the quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the companys employees identifying training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability effective succession planning is an important element of the companys programs failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder the companys ability to execute on its business strategies and level of service senior management of the company includes employees with long tenures some of whom may elect to retire the loss of the services of one or more key personnel could have an adverse effect on the companys business the company must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning the company believes that its compensation programs which have been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity are one of the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating its performance from that of many of its competitors significant changes to its compensation programs could affect the companys performance and ability to attract and retain key personnel  technology the company relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses future results depend upon expeditors success in developing competitive and reliable systems to address the needs of the companys customers and suppliers development and maintenance of these systems must be accomplished in a costeffective manner and support the use of secure protocols including integration of third party technology the company has begun upgrading many of its systems including core operations and accounting these processes are inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in the companys operations or its ability to remain competitive  network continuity and cybersecurity as the company and its customers continue to increase reliance on systems and as additional features are added the risks also increase any significant disruptions to the companys global systems or the internet for any reason which could include equipment or network failures colocation facility failures power outages sabotage employee error or other actions cyberattacks or other security breaches geopolitical activity or natural disasters all of which could have a material negative effect on the companys results this could include loss of revenue business disruptions such as the inability to timely process shipments loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information legal claims and proceedings reporting delays or errors interference with regulatory reporting significant remediation costs an increase in costs to protect the companys systems and technology or damage to its reputation    growth the company has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition future results will depend upon the companys ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations to continue to grow organically the company must gain profitable market share in a highly competitive environment and successfully develop and market new service offerings when investment opportunities arise the companys success will be dependent on its ability to evaluate and integrate the acquisitions   regulatory environment the company is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which the company operates many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation including those related to trade compliance data privacy employment and competition laws the current business environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and oversight the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and potentially unforeseen consequences in reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations these regulations are multilayered increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements amongst various governmental authorities furthermore the implementation of these regulations including deadlines and substantive requirements is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries realistic ability to comply failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations or the failure breach or compromise of the companys policies and procedures or those of its service providers or agents may result in increased operating costs damage to the companys reputation restrictions on operations andor fines and penalties   11risk factors discussion and potential significancecompetition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited nevertheless many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and are developing new technologies to gain competitive advantages depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities including some carriers the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial condition   taxes the company is subject to many taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in many of these jurisdictions the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules including interpretations of those rules the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits including transfer pricing inquiries could be materially different from the companys tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact its financial results  litigationinvestigations as a multinational corporation the company is subject to formal or informal investigations from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which it does business in addition the company may become subject to civil litigation with its customers service providers and other parties with whom it does business these investigations and litigation may require significant management time and could cause the company to incur substantial additional legal and related costs which may include fines penalties or damages that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations and operating cash flows   economic conditions the global economy and capital and credit markets continue to experience uncertainty and volatility unfavorable changes in economic conditions may result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect the companys revenues and operating results as experienced in 2009 and 2012 these conditions may adversely affect certain of the companys customers and services providers were that to occur the companys revenues and net earnings could also be adversely affected should customers ability to pay deteriorate additional bad debts may be incurred these unfavorable conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advanced notice the company often times cannot pass these rate increases on to its customers in the same time frame if at all as a result the companys yields and margins can be negatively impacted as experienced in 2012 and parts of 2013 and 2014 particularly with ocean freight   catastrophic events a disruption or failure of the companys systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake

of operationsoverviewexpeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company the companys services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own or operate transportation assetsthe company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsthe company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes  16in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of the companys three primary sources of revenuein most cases the company acts as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions the company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally when the company is the primary obligor it is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier has credit risk or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where the company is not primarily obligated and does not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination of thereof for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company does not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise acts solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenuecustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has officesthe company is managed along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the companys business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the companys overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013the companys operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin the companys strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the network 17the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each region in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs north asia is the companys largest export oriented region and accounted for 39 of revenues 23 of net revenues and 34 of operating income for the year ended december 31 2015 north asias operating income as a percentage of revenue is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that regionexpeditors culturefrom the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the companys greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demandstotal dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer servicecompliance with company policies and government regulationsaggressive marketing of all of the companys service offeringsongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal meanscreation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvementindividual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change occurs a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward andcontinuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of the companys customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make the companys employees more efficient and more effectivethe company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key nonexecutive manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a real world environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a careerthe company believes that any failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company quite possibly provides a greater threat to the companys continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond its control the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emergethe companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism and increased governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt the ocean steamship line industry has incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect the companys business in unpredictable waysinternational trade and competitionthe company operates in 63 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the companys business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the companys pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers we expect these competitive conditions to continue 18currently there is uncertainty as to how declines in oil prices will impact future buy rates due to a number of factors including that some carriers have hedged fuel costs because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its gross revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices the company would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from changes in oil pricesthe company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behaviorcritical accounting estimatesa summary of the companys significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this reportmanagement believes that the nature of the companys business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areasaccounts receivable valuationaccrual of costs related to ancillary services the company providesaccrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the related exposure which the company has selfinsuredaccrual of various tax liabilitiesaccrual of loss contingencies andcalculation of stockbased compensation expensethese estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies tax liabilities and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the companys transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reportedthe outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year the company is subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments the company believes its tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course the company is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in the company owing additional taxes the company establishes liabilities when despite its belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law it concludes that it may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors the companys estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction the company believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of its tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimatesas described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the companys stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting perioddetermining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the companys historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be materialthe companys expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the companys stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option the expected dividend yield is based on the companys historical  19experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patternsthe fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstancesrecent accounting pronouncementsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update asu amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring related detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers in august 2015 the fasb deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the asu on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures however at this time based on the nature of the companys operations the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognized or the companys revenue recognition policiesin november 2015 the fasb issued an asu simplifying the accounting for income taxes by requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the consolidated balance sheet the asu is effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted the asu may be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively the company is currently evaluating the method of adoption and expects this asu will have an impact on its consolidated balance sheets as its current deferred tax assets were 17 million and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities were 26 million as of december 31 2015in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu changing the accounting for leases and including a requirement to record all leases on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities the asu is effective for the company beginning on january 1 2019 adoption of the asu will impact the companys consolidated balance sheets as future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases totaled 131 million as of december 31 2015 the company is currently evaluating the full impact that the adoption of this asu will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosuresresults of operationsthe following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the companys principal services and the companys expenses for 2015 2014 and 2013 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing the companys principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by the company net revenue is one of the companys primary operational and financial measures that demonstrates the ability of the company to manage sell rates to customers with its ability to concentrate and leverage its purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 20the table

favorable spot and general market buying opportunities in 2015 partially offset by costs attributable to the increase in tonnageairfreight services net revenues in 2015 increased 11 as compared with 2014 the increase was principally due to a 6 improvement in airfreight tonnage and a 9 increase in net revenue per kilo north america net revenues increased by 8 due to 4 growth in export tonnage and lower average buy rates from favorable buying opportunities north asia net revenues increased 24 this was also due to favorable buying opportunities in 2015 which resulted in a 19 increase in net revenue per kilo on an 8 improvement in export tonnage south asia net revenues increased 27 primarily due to an 11 increase in tonnage and the same buying opportunities in the second half of 2015 europe net revenues decreased 7 primarily due to a 7 reduction in net revenue per kiloaside from temporary disruptions such as those experienced with us west coast ports the company expects the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity changes in the cost of jet fuel and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the company expects these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands these events should they occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell ratesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 1 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as container volumes increased 3 while average sell rates to customers were lower in the first half of 2014 the company implemented sell rate reductions to increase container volume beginning in september 2014 and continuing through the first quarter of 2015 the company maintained higher average rates in response to overall market conditions the company decreased average sell rates during the last nine months of 2015 in response to lower overall market demand and growth in carrier capacityocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 4 in 2015 as compared with 2014 due to favorable market buying opportunities that resulted from a decline in overall market demand coupled with growth in carrier capacity  22ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2015 as compared with 2014 the largest component of the companys ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 45 of ocean freight net revenue in 2015 and 2014 respectivelyocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 31 in 2015 as compared with 2014 this increase was due primarily to a 27 increase in net revenue per container and a 3 growth in container volume the company changed its pricing strategies as described above in the third quarter of 2014 which combined with favorable market buying opportunities in the last nine months of 2015 led to improved yields the company expects pricing volatility to continue as customers and carriers react to current market conditions which could result in reduced yieldsdirect ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 8 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as a result of higher volumes principally in north america europe and north asia order management net revenues increased 7 in 2015 as compared with 2014 mostly due to

volumes from existing and new customers europe net revenues decreased 4 as compared with 2014 due to general market conditionsoverhead expensessalaries and related costs increased 7 in 2015 as compared with 2014 principally as a result of increased bonuses resulting from higher operating income and an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2015 were up 18 as compared with 2014 primarily as a result of a 21 increase in operating income the companys management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs decreased 2 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 as compared with 2014 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from higher headcount and bonuses because the companys management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the companys services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the companys compensation programother overhead expenses remained flat in 2015 as compared with 2014 lower depreciation expense recovery of legal and related costs and a reduction in indirect taxes were partially offset by higher travel related costs technology consulting fees and claims other overhead expenses decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2015 as compared with 2014income tax expensethe company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the companys consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 376 in 2015 as compared with 379 in 2014 the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of a higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs the companys effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower  232014 compared with 2013 airfreight servicesairfreight services

2013 the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of an increasingly higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grantscurrency and other risk factorsthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the companys ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2015 2014 and 2013 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014 net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million and 2 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively foreign currency losses were 2 million in 2013international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than the company however the companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive forcethe primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial conditionlarger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide networkliquidity and capital resourcesthe companys principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015 was 565 million as compared with 395 million for 2014 this 170 million increase is primarily due to higher earnings and changes in working capital at december 31 2015 working capital was 1132 million including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 808 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2015 management believes that the companys current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligationsas a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and tax to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these pass through billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria the company has agreed to extend payment terms beyond its customary terms management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problemsthe companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes

management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2015 will be fulfilled during 2016 in the companys ordinary course of business the companys foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases the companys ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2015 cash and cash equivalent balances of 536 million were held by the companys nonunited states subsidiaries of which 49 million was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been accrued for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated impact of inflationto date the companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the companys margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest ratesoffbalance sheet arrangementsas of december 31 2015 the company did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation skitem 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the companys exposure to these risks is presented below 26foreign exchange riskthe company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the companys earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british poundforeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the companys functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2015 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 54 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 44 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptionsthe company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the companys ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2015 was insignificant net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million and 2 million in 2015 and 2014 respectively net foreign currency losses were 2 million in 2013 the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2015 the company had less than 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 daysinterest rate riskat december 31 2015 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 808 million of which 362 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2015 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2015 would not have a significant impact on the companys earningsin managements opinion there has been no material change in the companys interest rate risk exposure

company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsas a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselvesairfreight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company f9acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges in these transactions the company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally when the company is the primary obligor it is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier has credit risk or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where the company is not primarily obligated and does not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof based upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same timerevenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue these revenues are recognized upon completion of the servicescustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company performs multiple services these services include ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the servicetypically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as doortodoor service this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy modified as agreed upon by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the companys branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate is done in an objective manner on a relative selling price basisthe company presents revenues net of sales and valueadded taxesf  income taxesincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes have been provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized the company recognizes interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits or underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and recognizes penalties in operating expensesg  net earnings attributable to shareholders per common sharediluted earnings attributable to shareholders per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding dilutive potential common shares represent outstanding stock options stock purchase rights and unvested restricted shares basic earnings attributable to shareholders per share is calculated using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding without taking into consideration dilutive potential common shares outstandingh  stock plansthe company recognizes stock compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of awards granted to employees and directors under the companys stock option director restricted stock and employee stock purchase rights plans this expense adjusted for expected forfeitures is recognized in net earnings on a straightline basis over the stock awards vesting periods as salaries and related costsi  foreign currencyforeign currency amounts attributable to foreign operations have been translated into us dollars using yearend exchange rates for assets and liabilities historical rates for equity and weighted average rates for revenues and expenses translation adjustments f10resulting from this process are recorded as components of other comprehensive income until complete or substantially complete liquidation by the company of its investment in a foreign entity currency fluctuations are a normal operating factor in the conduct of the companys business and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in revenues and operating expenses also the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local functional currency foreign exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognized in net earnings within airfreight services costs and other income net net foreign currency gains in 2015 and 2014 were 7820 and 1517 respectively net foreign currency losses in 2013 were 1687the company follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage its foreign exchange exposure accordingly the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the companys ability to move money freely such hedging activity during 2015 2014 and 2013 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives
