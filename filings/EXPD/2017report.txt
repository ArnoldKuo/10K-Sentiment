airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today expeditors has approximately 16000 employees and provides a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise we plan to create new offices while expeditors has historically expanded through organic

in late 2014 by our executive team those operational initiatives are focused and aligned to achieve longterm earnings growth the strategic plan is to grow business by focusing on the right markets and within each market on the right customers that lead to profitable business growth expeditors teams are aligned on the specific markets of its focused priorities on the targeted accounts within those markets and on ways that we can continue to differentiate ourselves from our competitors we are continuing our focus on growth based on four key strategic initiatives1ensure that every operating units baseline growth strategies for air ocean and customs services grow at the rate of each units ie district or region relevant market growth rate and expeditors transcon and distribution services are expected to maintain higher growth rates2align and integrate our europeanasian pacific and europeannorth americas interests to the same degree that our asian pacific and americas interests have historically been aligned this alignment is expected to result in additional growth in these markets beyond our baseline growth expectations3leverage our long and deeply entrenched presence in various asian export markets  as well as the reputation that we have with the strategic carriers servicing those markets  to create a stronger asian import presence while concentrating and enhancing our export capabilities in key strategic lanes particularly into and out of china and southeast asia we expect this to create additional product growth opportunities in those markets which have not historically been a particular focus for us4expand market share growth and position in north america traditionally expeditors most strategic marketin addition in early 2017 we announced the appointment of philip m coughlin to the newly created position of chief strategy officer effective on february 28 and reporting directly to president and chief executive officer jeff musser mr coughlins role is to establish and oversee a core strategy group within expeditors comprised of current employees with a deep understanding of our products services and technology and external individuals with expertise in supply chain management data and market analysis and technology mr coughlins team will be focused on exploring new avenues for innovation differentiation and expansionglobal logistics and supply chain technologyexpeditors has long believed that it is a competitive advantage to focus on organic growth and to utilize an enterprise technology platform designed and built by logistics technology professionals for logistics professionals our technology platform is built on principles of innovation agility collaboration performance and consistency across the expeditors global network to meet diverse and complex global logistics and supply chain needs the platform is comprised of proprietary third party and open source technologies we utilize a globally consistent infrastructure supporting both centralized and distributed technology strategies that incorporate disaster recovery and high availabilityexpeditors technology platform is designed coded tested and implemented by the collaborative efforts of our logistics industry and information technology professionals internally developing and maintaining technology capabilities is in keeping with expeditors longheld belief that it not outsource core functions with information systems being one of those core functionswe are not dependent on third parties for developing or enhancing our core technology platforms to address our needs or those of our customers expeditors also believes that having a single uniform globallyconnected platform driving logistics operations and providing comprehensive visibility and advanced analytics create greater efficiency and value particularly as the value of timely data and insights into that data are increasingly importantorganic versus acquired growthas a knowledgebased global provider of logistics services we have often concluded over the course of our history that it is better to grow organically rather than by acquisition when we have made acquisitions it has generally been to obtain technology geographic coverage and specialized industry expertise that could be leveraged to benefit our entire network nevertheless despite our history of organic growth we are not opposed to acquisitions and we will continue to identify and assess desirable acquisitions 3tailored solutions and targeted marketingas a nonasset based provider we have considerable flexibility to tailor customerspecific solutions based on a customers needs by understanding a customers logistics processes and goals we are able to identify opportunities for improvement and are able to deploy relevant services and solutions for that customer these services include all modes of cargo transportation customs brokerage warehousing and distribution and order

for oversized and heavy lift freight we offer these services across the globe on a single technology platform in conjunction with consistent and efficient operations and processes that adhere to the highest standards of compliancebecause expeditors is in the business of optimizing customer logistics and supply chains we focus our marketing strategy and efforts on professionals in logistics and supply chain management roles while we drive our strategic marketing at a global level district management of each office is responsible for its own business development operations and service execution all employees are responsible for customer service and retentionleveraging global regional and local expertiseexpeditors defines strategy processes technology and compliance that are supported and executed at all levels with dedicated account management personnel coupled with regional and local expertise we staff our districts principally with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics district managers and their staff are responsible for selling expeditors services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient services we believe that this regional and local expertise in supply chain solutions tailored to the needs of our customers our emphasis on exceptional customer service along with our incentivebased compensation program that rewards employees based on the performance of the operations they control have been important elements of our success we believe this balanced approach between corporate regional and local expertise enables us to supply solutions customized to the needs of our customerswhat expeditors shipsthe goods that expeditors handles are generally a function of the products that dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination these goods include products from multiple industries including electronics high technology healthcare aerospace and aviation manufacturing oil and energy automotive retail and fashion in order to meet customers complex and industry specific demands we utilize industry vertical teams throughout our network to focus on providing solutions in different industries industry vertical teams work closely with our regional and district resources to grow our business no single customer accounts for five percent or more of our net revenuesexpeditors services in detailthe following describes in more detail the operations of each of expeditors servicesairfreight servicesairfreight services accounted for approximately 40 41 and 42 percent of expeditors total revenues and 32 34 and 34 percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively when performing airfreight services we typically act either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline that carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator we purchase cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resell that space to our customers at lower rates than they could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment we then issue a house airway bill hawb to our customers as the contract of carriage and separately we receive a master airway bill from the airline when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation we receive and forward individual shipments as the agent of the airline that carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent we offer our customers expertise for optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of high demandin our airfreight operations we receive shipments from our customers determine the routing consolidate shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and select the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point either we or an expeditors agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinationswe estimate that our average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and that a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or bothat the origin expeditors typically delivers shipments from one of our warehouses to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets normally that shipment will then arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours from the point of origin during periods of high demand cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist we may charter aircraft to meet customer demandexpeditors consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost that we charge per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment we are able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than what is charged for an individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipmentour airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate that the airline charges expeditors and the rate that we in turn charge our customers in addition to commissions that the airline pays us and fees that we charge for ancillary services such ancillary services we provide include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when expeditors acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment our net revenues are derived primarily from airline commissions and customer fees for ancillary services 4expeditors management believes that owning aircraft would subject us to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with our service providers  the airlines because we rely on commercial airlines to transport our shipments our business may be adversely affected by changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service although airline profitability has improved over the last two years many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products companies continue to decrease the size and weight of shipments and many expeditors customers are focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying expeditors has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings for our customers the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge our ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityin 2015 airfreight customers continued to seek reductions in rates related to lower fuel prices that trend persisted in 2016 along with carriers incorporating the lower fuel rates into their pricing structures there continues to be uncertainty as to how future buy rates will be impacted by continuing volatility in fuel prices due to a number of factors because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts expeditors buy and sell rates we would expect our airfreight revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the impact of changing fuel prices however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to changes we would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from any future movements in fuel pricesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight services accounted for approximately 32 33 and 33 percent of expeditors total revenues and 25 25 and 23 percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we operate expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where we have an office or an agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order managementocean freight consolidation as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio provides full container load services to companies that need flexibility and access to vessel capacity that they may not necessarily achieve by dealing directly with the shipping lines additionally eio supports customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also leverages the expeditors global gateway network for the movement of lcl freight for customers needing to ship smaller consignments via ocean eio issues a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services that eio may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws direct ocean forwarding when the customer contracts directly with the ocean carrier eio acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the ocean carrier and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements eio does not issue a hobl or house seaway bill rather the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs eio to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipperorder management order management provides services that manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a webbased application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near realtime status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and consolidating these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers ocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of one of the larger carriers in the market as well as multiple mergers and acquisitions as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and regain their financial footing additionally while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity this excess capacity is at the heart of the carriers financial challenge as they pursue business at lower rate levels to achieve higher load factors consequently when the market goes through seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption and demand exceeds supply the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible to offset their previous losses this carrier behavior along with fluctuations in demand creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityoil prices are reflected in both the buy and sell rates for ocean freight via a surcharge known as the bunker adjustment factor this surcharge in the industry fluctuates with the cost of the bunker fuel and is added to base ocean freight charges however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to changes expeditors would not expect an adverse effect on ocean freight net revenues resulting from future movements in oil prices 5customs brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 28 26 and 25 percent of expeditors total revenues and 43 41 and 43 percent of total net revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as a customs broker we assist importers in clearing shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the brokerage business require that we continuously enhance our systems to provide competitive service we provide customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments we handle through our transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments that we handle may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customerwe also provide other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution transcon and consulting services none of which individually are currently significant to our total revenues and net revenues expeditors distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services expeditors whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer drivenrequests for trade compliance consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projectscompetitionthe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited further there are new technologybased competitors entering the industry many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors depending on the location of the shipper and the importer expeditors must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areasthe primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations expeditors emphasizes quality customer service and believes that our prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industrylarger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime delivery network optimization transportation flow optimization and process improvement accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications customized reporting data analytics and solution modelingsimulationoptimizationexpeditors management believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet our customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in our ongoing success we devote a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems in order to meet these customer demands management believes that our existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which we competeunlike many of our competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition expeditors operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of our fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of our competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill as a result expeditors has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitionsour ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of expeditors ability to compete in the industry to this end we have adopted incentive compensation programs that make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel we believe that these incentive compensation programs combined with our experienced personnel and our ability to coordinate global marketing and business development efforts provide a distinct competitive advantagecurrency and dependence on service providersour worldwide operations require that we transact in a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar that exposes us to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor have agency relationships maintain strict currency control regulations that influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices or agentsin addition our ability to provide services to our customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carrier lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies we use a consistent approach in selecting and managing service providers across all of our product offerings beginning with a rigorous qualification and riskbased diligence process we select and engage with bestinclass compliancefocused efficiently run growthoriented partners based upon defined value elements and are intentional in our relationship and performance management activity reinforcing success by awarding service providers who consistently achieve at the highest levels with additional business we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect our business in unpredictable ways 6seasonalityhistorically our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest however there is no assurance that this seasonal trend will occur in the future this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces we cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can we estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periodsenvironmentalin the united states we are subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which we operate although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and we cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on our business we do not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2017expeditors is committed to continual improvement in reducing the sum total impact of our operations on the environment we have over 200 employeeled green teams which cover each of our local district offices and are responsible for projects focused on reducing expeditors

respect to activities in the air transportation industry in the united states expeditors is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa our overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation each expeditors office is licensed or in the case of our newer offices we have applied for a license as an airfreight forwarder from the international air transport association iata a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities that prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of our airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines that are iata membersexpeditors is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as an nvocc by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically establishing the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penalties 8expeditors is licensed as a customs broker by the customs and border protection cbp agency of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which we do business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which expeditors performs customs clearance services we are licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services expeditors participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states as well as other security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo programs in various other countrieswe do not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon our business operations in general expeditors conducts business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to our ability to provide the full range of our business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when we encounter this sort of governmental restriction we work to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also providing the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required licensethe continuing global threats from terrorism wars and governments overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terrorrelated incidents we and our competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within our respective scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past we believe that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees expeditors position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of our servicescargo liabilitywhen acting as an airfreight consolidator expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 19 special drawing rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill the airline that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper we do not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline when acting as an ocean freight consolidator expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ocean carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent we do not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments in our ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations when providing ground transportation services as a carrier expeditors assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the value of the goods or the released value generally 050 per pound although the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier that we utilize to make the actual shipment is generally liable to us in the same manner and to the same extent when providing warehousing and distribution services our legal liability is limited by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of the value of the goods or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per lot  which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track in certain circumstances expeditors will assume additional limited liability we maintain cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which we are legally liable expeditors also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others that is stored in our warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont usbased insurance entity whollyowned by expeditors the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by expeditors in 2016 was 5 million in addition we are licensed as an insurance broker through our subsidiary expeditors cargo insurance brokers inc and place insurance coverage for other customers 9item 1a  risk factorsrisk factors discussion and potential significance   international trade expeditors primarily provides services to customers engaged in international commerce everything that affects international trade has the potential to expand or contract our primary market and adversely impact our operating results for example international trade is influenced by    currency exchange rates and currency control regulations    interest rate fluctuations    changes and uncertainties in governmental policies such as taxation quota restrictions other forms of trade barriers andor restrictions and trade accords    changes in and application of international and domestic customs trade and security regulations    wars strikes civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts    changes in labor and other costs    natural disasters and pandemics    changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own   changes in availability of credit    changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleumrelated products and    increased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability   service providers as a nonasset based provider of global logistics services expeditors depends on a variety of assetbased service providers including air ocean and ground freight carriers the quality and profitability of our services depend upon effective selection management and discipline of service providers in recent years many of our service providers have incurred significant operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt and in 2016 one of the worlds largest ocean carriers filed for bankruptcy additionally several ocean carriers have consolidated with the potential for more to occur in the future changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers and space allotment made available to expeditors by assetbased carriers could affect us in unpredictable ways any combination of reduced carrier capacity pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules could negatively impact our ability to maintain historical profitability expeditors carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our business future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in transportation industries which in turn could increase our purchased transportation costs if we are unable to pass such costs on to our customers our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected    key personnel identifying training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability effective succession planning is an important element of our programs failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our ability to execute on our business strategies and level of service senior management of expeditors includes employees with long tenures some of whom may elect to retire the loss of the services of one or more key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business we must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning we believe that our compensation programs which have been in place since we became a publicly traded entity are one of the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating our performance from that of many of our competitors significant changes to compensation programs could affect our performance and ability to attract and retain key personnel   technology expeditors relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing our core businesses future results depend on our success in developing competitive and reliable systems to address the needs of our customers and suppliers development and maintenance of these systems must be accomplished in a costeffective manner and support the use of secure protocols including integration and availability of third party technology we are continually enhancing our systems including significant upgrades to core operating and accounting systems these efforts are inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in our operations or our ability to remain competitive   network continuity and cybersecurity as expeditors and our customers continue to increase reliance on systems and as additional features are added the risks also increase any significant disruptions to our global systems or the internet for any reason which could include equipment or network failures colocation facility failures power outages sabotage employee error or other actions cyberattacks or other security breaches reliance on third party technology geopolitical activity or natural disasters all of which could have a material negative effect on our results this could include loss of revenue business disruptions such as the inability to timely process shipments loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information legal claims and proceedings reporting delays or errors interference with regulatory reporting significant remediation costs an increase in costs to protect our systems and technology or damage to our reputation  10risk factors discussion and potential significance   foreign operations the majority of expeditors revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states to maintain a global service network we may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition we operate in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws rules regulations and decrees of the united states and of other countries in which we conduct business including the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act as well as trade and exchange control laws or laws regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions and antiboycott laws and regulations compliance with these laws rules regulations and decrees is dependent on our employees service providers agents third party brokers and customers whose individual actions could violate these laws rules regulations and decrees failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses damage to our reputation and restrictions on our ability to conduct business   growth expeditors has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition future results will depend upon our ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations to continue to grow organically we must gain profitable market share in a highly competitive environment and successfully develop and market new service offerings when investment opportunities arise our success could be dependent on our ability to evaluate and integrate acquisitions    regulatory environment expeditors is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which we operate many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation including those related to trade compliance data privacy employment and competition laws and may result in unforeseen costs in reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations these regulations are multilayered increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements amongst various governmental authorities furthermore the implementation of these regulations including deadlines and substantive requirements is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries realistic ability to comply failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations or the failure breach or compromise of our policies and procedures or those of our service providers or agents may result in increased operating costs damage to our reputation restrictions on operations or fines and penalties   competition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited nevertheless many of these competitors have significantly more resources than expeditors and are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and are developing new technologies to gain competitive advantages depending on the location of the shipper and the importer we must compete against both the niche players larger entities including carriers and emerging technology companies the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms fixedprice arrangements higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial condition   taxes expeditors is subject to many taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in many of these jurisdictions the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules including interpretations of those rules we are regularly under audit by tax authorities although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits including transfer pricing inquiries could be materially different from our tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact our financial results 11risk factors discussion and potential significancelitigationinvestigations as a multinational corporation expeditors is subject to formal or informal investigations from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which we do business in addition we may become subject to civil litigation with our customers service providers and other parties with whom we do business these investigations and litigation may require significant management time and could cause us to incur substantial additional legal and related costs which may include fines penalties or damages that could have a materially adverse impact on our financial results   economic conditions the global economy and capital and credit markets continue to experience uncertainty and volatility unfavorable changes in economic conditions may result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect expeditors revenues and operating results as experienced in 2009 and 2012 these conditions may adversely affect certain of our customers and services providers were that to occur our revenues and net earnings could also be adversely affected should our customers ability to pay deteriorate additional bad debts may be incurred   predictability of results expeditors is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting shortterm customer requirements however longterm customer satisfaction depends upon our ability to meet these unpredictable shortterm customer requirements personnel costs our single largest expense are always less flexible in the very near term as we must staff to meet uncertain demand as a result shortterm operating results could be disproportionately affected a significant portion of expeditors revenues are derived from customers in retail and technology industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of our revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of our control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods product launches andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore we may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of our stockvolatile market conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advance notice we often times cannot pass these rate increases on to our customers in the same time frame if at all as a result our yields and margins can be negatively impacted as experienced in 2012 and parts of 2013 2014 and 2016 particularly with ocean freight   catastrophic events a disruption or failure of expeditors systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other missioncritical functions our corporate headquarters and certain other critical business operations are in the seattle washington area which is near major earthquake faults a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology

and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverviewexpeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company our services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions we do not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier we do not own or operate transportation assetswe derive our revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in our financial statementswe generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to our customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to our customers the sell rate and the rate we pay to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments  16from multiple customers and concentrating our buying power we are able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of our three primary sources of revenuein most cases we act as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier we issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier we receive a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally revenue is recorded on a gross basis when we are the primary obligor are obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service have latitude in establishing price have discretion in selecting the direct carrier have credit risk or have several but not all of these indicators revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where we are not primarily obligated and do not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when we do not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill or otherwise act solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions we are not a principal and report only commissions and fees earned in revenuecustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which we have officeswe manage our company along five geographic areas of responsibility americas north asia south asia europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility our business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to our overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014our operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies that we use when our offices transact business with independent agents certain costs are allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying services which can include allocation based on actual costs incurred or estimated cost plus a profit margin our strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within our network 17the mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each of our regions in accordance with our revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs north asia is our largest export oriented region and accounted for 37 of revenues 22 of net revenues and 34 of operating income for the year ended december 31 2016 north asias net revenues as a percentage of revenues is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that regionexpeditors culturefrom the inception of our company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting

customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effectivewe reinforce these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since we became a publicly traded company there is no limit to how much a key nonexecutive manager can be compensated for success we believe in a real world environment where the employees of our operating units are held accountable for the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses management generally must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time our policies processes and relevant training focus on such things as cargo management risk mitigation compliance accounts receivable collection cash flow and credit soundness in an attempt to help managers avoid the kinds of errors that might end a careerwe believe that failure to perpetuate our unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout our organization quite possibly provides a greater threat to our continued success than any external force which likely would be largely beyond our control we strongly believe that it is nearly impossible to predict events that individually or in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on our future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help us adapt and thrive as major trends emergeour ability to provide services to customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean carriers ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism security changes in governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws we consider our current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory our business is also highly dependent on the financial stability and operational capabilities of the carriers we utilize over the last two years airline profitability has improved although many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt moreover the ocean carrier industry has incurred substantial losses in recent years many carriers are highly leveraged with debt and certain carriers are facing significant liquidity challenges such as those that led to the bankruptcy filing of a large ocean carrier that occurred in august 2016 this situation requires that we be selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect our business in unpredictable waysinternational trade and competitionwe operate in over 60 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and our activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords we cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on our business doing business in foreign locations also subjects us to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade our business may also be negatively affected by recent political developments and changes in government personnel or policies in the united states and other countries as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which we conduct business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global trade and economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating  18currency exchange rates our pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers we expect these operating and competitive conditions to continueocean carriers have incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt these financial challenges have resulted in the 2016 bankruptcy of one of the larger carriers in the market as well as multiple mergers and acquisitions as the carriers pursue scale and market share in an effort to reduce operating costs and improve their financial results additionally while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new and larger ships which has created excess capacity consequently when the market experiences seasonal peaks or any sort of disruption the carriers react by increasing their pricing as quickly as possible this carrier behavior creates pricing volatility that could impact expeditors ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilitythere is uncertainty as to how changes in oil prices will impact future buy rates because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both our cargo space buy rates and sell rates to customers we would expect our gross revenues and costs to be impacted as carriers adjust rates for the effect of changing fuel prices however other than temporary impacts as buy and sell rates adjust to change we would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from future movements in oil pricesthe global economic environment and trade growth remain uncertain we cannot predict what impact this may have on our operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behavior additionally we cannot predict the direct or indirect impact that changes in consumer purchasing behavior such as online shopping could have on our businesscritical accounting estimatesa summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this reportmanagement believes that the nature of our business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areasaccounts receivable valuationaccrual of costs related to ancillary services we provideaccrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the related exposure which we have selfinsuredaccrual of various tax liabilitiesaccrual of loss contingencies andcalculation of stockbased compensation expensethese estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies tax liabilities and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to these transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates management believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reportedthe outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on our financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year we are subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves estimates and judgments management believes our tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course expeditors is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in additional tax payments being required we establish liabilities when despite our belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law we conclude that we may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position and in consultation with qualified tax advisors our estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction we believe the estimates and assumptions used to support the evaluation of our tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimatesas described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report we account for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under our stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting perioddetermining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields historically we have used the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options  19management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon our historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be materialour expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of our stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option the expected dividend yield is based on our historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patternsthe fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstancesrecent accounting pronouncementsin march 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update asu simplifying the accounting for stock compensation the asu requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in our consolidated statements of earnings when our stock options are exercised or canceled and for disqualifying dispositions of shares issued to employees under our employee stock purchase plan all taxrelated cash flows are required to be reported as operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows we will adopt this asu on a prospective basis beginning on january 1 2017 we have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur in determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period we believe the adoption of this asu will result in volatility in our effective tax rate and diluted earnings per share due to the recording of all of the tax effects of sharebased payments in our consolidated statements of earnings the volatility in future periods will be dependent upon our stock price stock option exercise and cancellation activity and the amount of disqualifying dispositions of shares purchased by our employees under our employee stock purchase plan had the standard been effective in 2016 and 2015 it would have resulted in 27 million of additional tax expense and a 11 million tax benefit respectivelyin may 2014 the fasb issued an asu amending existing revenue recognition guidance and requiring related detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers this asu is effective for us beginning on january 1 2018 we formed a crossfunctional project team that is in the process of evaluating the adoption impacts of the asu for each of our products and services this process though underway is not yet completed and our understanding of the future adoption impacts including any potential changes related to principal and agent determinations on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures of the asu have not yet been determined our project team is also assessing how our current processes and systems may be impacted by adoption we have yet to decide whether we will adopt under a cumulative effect or retrospective method at this time based on the nature of our operations we do not believe that the adoption of the asu will have a material impact on the amount or timing of revenue recognized or our revenue recognition policies however we have not yet completed our full assessment we expect to complete our assessment of the impact towards the end of 2017 in february 2016 the fasb issued an asu changing the accounting for leases and including a requirement to record all leases on the consolidated balance sheet as assets and liabilities the asu will be effective for us beginning on january 1 2019 and will be adopted using a modified retrospective transition adoption of the asu will impact our consolidated balance sheets as future minimum lease payments under noncancelable leases totaled 214 million as of december 31 2016 we are currently evaluating the full impact that the adoption of this asu will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosuresresults of operationsthe following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses attributable to our principal services and our expenses for 2016 2015 and 2014 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing our principal services since total revenues earned by expeditors as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to us for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by expeditors in our other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by us net revenue is one of our primary operational and financial measures and demonstrates our ability to manage sell rates to customers with our ability to concentrate and leverage our purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 20the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related

result of lowering average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions the decrease in average sell rates was partially offset by a 3 growth in airfreight tonnage airfreight services expenses decreased 12 in 2016 as compared with 2015 as a result of favorable buying opportunities throughout most regions due primarily to excess available carrier capacity while not possible to quantify sell rates and tonnage were favorably impacted in 2015 by customers converting a portion of their ocean freight shipments to airfreight due to port disruptions on the us west coastairfreight services net revenues in 2016 decreased 7 as compared with 2015 the decrease was principally due to a 12 decrease in net revenue per kilo partially offset by a 3 increase in tonnage average net revenue per kilo declined in most regions primarily due to competitive market conditions and rapid changes in carrier pricing caused by sporadic increases in demand north america net revenues decreased by 6 due principally to a 3 decrease in tonnage north asia south asia and europe net revenues decreased 10 9 and 2 respectively despite tonnage increases of 5 7 and 3aside from temporary disruptions such as those experienced with us west coast ports in 2015 we expect the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible we expect these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands historically we have experienced lower airfreight margins in the fourth quarter as seasonal volumes increase and carriers correspondingly increase buy rates these events should they continue to occur could create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell ratesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management are the three basic services that constitute and are collectively referred to as ocean freight and ocean services ocean freight and ocean services revenues decreased 13 in 2016 as compared with 2015 as we continued to lower average sell rates to customers in response to competitive market conditions and lower available buy rates from carriers although average sell rates to customers declined container volumes increased 3 ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 16 in 2016 as compared with 2015 due to lower average buy rates resulting from carrier overcapacity ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2016 as compared with 2015 the largest component of our ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 48 and 50 of ocean freight net revenue in 2016 and 2015 respectively 22ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 6 in 2016 as compared with 2015 this decrease was due primarily to an 8 decrease in net revenue per container partially offset by a 3 increase in volume during the latter part of the third quarter of 2016 we experienced a spike in average buy rates that began with the bankruptcy of a large ocean carrier on august 31 2016 direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues decreased 2 due to lower volumes principally in north america order management net revenues increased 11 mostly resulting from higher volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north asia and south asianorth america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 3 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily due to lower direct ocean forwarding volumes and a decrease in ocean freight consolidation resulting from declining margins on imports north asia net revenues decreased 1 as lower margins offset the 1 growth in volume europe net revenues decreased 4 as lower direct ocean forwarding volumes more than offset growth from order management and ocean freight consolidation south asia net revenues increased 6 due principally to 4 growth in volumeswe expect that pricing volatility will continue as customers increasingly solicit bids and carriers react to current market conditions including carrier liquidity challenges such as the bankruptcy filing of a large ocean carrier that occurred in august 2016 and realignment of carrier alliances these conditions could result in lower revenues and yieldscustoms brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 3 and 1 respectively in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of increased volumes from existing and new road freight customerscustoms brokerage and other services net revenues increased 4 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in road freight volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environmentnorth america net revenues increased 5 in 2016 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customers in road freight and lower import service costs north asia net revenues increased 8 due primarily to growth in import and warehouse and distribution services europe net revenues remained constant as compared with 2015overhead expensessalaries and related costs increased 1 in 2016 as compared with 2015 principally due to an increase in the number of employees primarily in north america and europe partially offset by reduced bonuses from lower operating incomehistorically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of our company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in our operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to field and executive management in 2016 were down 7 as compared with 2015 primarily as a result of a 7 decrease in operating income our management compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs increased to 53 of net revenues in 2016 as compared with 52 in 2015 because our management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative generally no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in limited circumstances makes exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs we believe that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by our managers due to the nature of our services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in our compensation programsother overhead expenses increased 4 in 2016 as compared with 2015 the increase in expenses was primarily due to higher rent and maintenance costs and technology fees partially offset by lower claims in the current year other overhead expenses increased to 16 of net revenues in 2016 as compared with 15 in 2015income tax expensewe pay income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions our consolidated effective income tax rate declined slightly to 370 in 2016 as compared with 376 in 2015 the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of a higher proportion of our total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock option grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs our effective tax rate is subject to variation and the effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pretax income or loss for example the impact of discrete items and nondeductible expenses on the effective tax rate is greater when pretax income is lower  232015 compared with 2014 airfreight servicesairfreight services revenues decreased 1 in 2015 as compared with 2014 due primarily to lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america europe and north asia partially offset by a 6 growth

to the increase in tonnageairfreight services net revenues in 2015 increased 11 as compared with 2014 the increase was principally due to a 6 improvement in airfreight tonnage and a 9 increase in net revenue per kilo north america net revenues increased by 8 due to 4 growth in export tonnage and lower average buy rates from favorable buying opportunities north asia net revenues increased 24 this was also due to favorable buying opportunities in 2015 which resulted in a 19 increase in net revenue per kilo on an 8 improvement in export tonnage south asia net revenues increased 27 primarily due to an 11 increase in tonnage and the same buying opportunities in the second half of 2015 europe net revenues decreased 7 primarily due to a 7 reduction in net revenue per kilo ocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 1 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as container volumes increased 3 while average sell rates to customers were lower in the first half of 2014 we implemented sell rate reductions to increase container volume beginning in september 2014 and continuing through the first quarter of 2015 we maintained higher average rates in response to overall market conditions we decreased average sell rates during the last nine months of 2015 in response to lower overall market demand and growth in carrier capacity ocean freight and ocean services expenses decreased 4 in 2015 as compared with 2014 due to favorable market buying opportunities that resulted from a decline in overall market demand coupled with growth in carrier capacity ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 18 in 2015 as compared with 2014 in 2015 and 2014 the majority of our ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 45 respectively of ocean freight net revenue ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 31 in 2015 as compared with 2014 this increase was due primarily to a 27 increase in net revenue per container and a 3 growth in container volume we changed our pricing strategies as described above in the third quarter of 2014 which combined with favorable market buying opportunities in the last nine months of 2015 led to improved yields direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 8 in 2015 as compared with 2014 as a result of higher volumes principally in north america

necessitates dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in our being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where we maintain offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure we try to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among our offices and agents we may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on our ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2016 2015 and 2014 was insignificant we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2016 and 2015 net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million in both 2016 and 2015 and 2 million in 2014international air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than us however our primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive forcethe primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations we emphasize quality customer service and believe that our prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage our results of operations and financial conditionlarger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management we believe that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide networkliquidity and capital resourcesour principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016 was 529 million as compared with 565 million for 2015 this 36 million decrease is primarily due to lower earnings and changes in working capital at december 31 2016 working capital was 1289 million including cash and cash equivalents of 974 million we had no longterm debt at december 31 2016 management believes that our current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligationsas a customs broker we make significant cash advances for a select group of our creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties and tax to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these pass through billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria we have agreed to extend payment terms beyond our customary terms management believes that it has established effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problemsour business historically has been subject to seasonal fluctuations and this is expected to continue in the future cash flows fluctuate as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with periods of higher demand typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes

shortterm unconditional purchase obligations with assetbased providers reserving space on a guaranteed basis the pricing of these obligations varies to some degree with market conditions we only enter into agreements that management believes we can fulfill historically we have met these obligations in the normal course of business management believes in line with historical experience committed purchase obligations outstanding as of december 31 2016 will be fulfilled during 2017 in the ordinary course of business also in october 2016 we entered into a contractual agreement to construct a building in europe that is currently expected to cost 51 million 45 millionour foreign subsidiaries regularly remit dividends to the us parent company after evaluating their working capital requirements and needs to finance local capital expenditures in some cases our ability to repatriate funds from foreign operations may be subject to foreign exchange controls at december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalent balances of 504 million were held by our nonunited states subsidiaries of which 73 million was held in banks in the united states earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly a deferred tax liability has been established for all undistributed earnings net of foreign related tax credits that are available to be repatriated impact of inflationto date our business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in our margins as we are not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and have not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness we currently have limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest ratesoffbalance sheet arrangementsas of december 31 2016 we did not have any material offbalancesheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of sec regulation skitem 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of our exposure to these risks is presented belowforeign exchange riskwe conduct business in many different countries and currencies our business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business we create numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to our earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which expeditors is exposed include chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british poundforeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on our earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar our functional currency relative to the other currencies in which we transact business all other things being equal an  26average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2016 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 47 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 39 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptionswe currently do not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enter into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict our ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2016 was insignificant net foreign currency gains were approximately 8 million in both 2016 and 2015 and were 2 million in 2014 we had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2016 and 2015 we instead follow a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings as of december 31 2016 we had 11 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 daysinterest rate riskat december 31 2016 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 974 million of which 568 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates we had no longterm debt at december 31 2016 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2016 would not have a significant impact on our earningsin managements opinion there has been no material change in our interest rate risk exposure between 2016 and 2015item 8  financial

officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors or intentional fraud an internal control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of such internal controls are met further the design of an internal control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all internal control systems no evaluation of controls can provide

test during the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurrede  revenues and revenue recognitionthe company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsas a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselvesf9airfreight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb a house ocean bill of lading hobl or a house seaway bill to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges in these transactions the company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross or net amount as revenue generally when the company is the primary obligor it is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier has credit risk or has several but not all of these indicators revenue is recorded on a gross basis revenue is generally recorded on a net basis where the company is not primarily obligated and does not have latitude in establishing prices such amounts earned are determined using a fixed fee a per unit of activity fee or a combination thereof based upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same timerevenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue a hawb a hobl or a house seaway bill include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue these revenues are recognized upon completion of the servicescustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company performs multiple services these services include ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the servicetypically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as doortodoor service this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy modified as agreed upon by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the companys branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate is done in an objective manner on a relative selling price basisthe company presents revenues net of sales and valueadded taxesf  income taxesincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes have been provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized the company recognizes interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits or underpayment of income taxes in interest expense and recognizes penalties in operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016 the company adopted accounting guidance that retroactively changed the presentation of deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent as a result the company retrospectively reclassified previously reported current deferred income tax assets totaling 16861 at december 31 2015 to a reduction of noncurrent deferred tax liabilities presented as deferred
