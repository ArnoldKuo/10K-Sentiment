expenditures depreciation and amortization and equity attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 10 to the consolidated financial statementsairfreight servicesairfreight services accounted for approximately 34 37 and 38 percent of the companys 2012 2011 and 2010 consolidated revenues net of freight consolidation expenses net revenues respectively when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines when moving shipments between points where the volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demandin its airfreight forwarding operations the company procures shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinations1the company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2500 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or boththe company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demandthe company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines to forwarders and others also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipmentthe companys airfreight forwarding net revenues from a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating and insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customerthe company also performs breakbulk services which involve receiving and breaking down consolidated airfreight lots and arranging for distribution of the individual shipments breakbulk service revenues also include commissions from agents for airfreight shipmentsthe company does not own aircraft and does not plan to do so management believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may affect its business the commercial airline industry as a whole incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 while their operations have improved over 2009 levels many airlines remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and more infrequent flights could challenge the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight services accounted for approximately 24 23 and 23 percent of the companys 2012 2011 and 2010 consolidated net revenues respectively the company operates expeditors international ocean eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight consolidation in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not have annual shipping volumes sufficient to negotiate comparable contracts directly with the ocean carriers and for those customers that prefer to have the flexibility that eios multiple carrier contracts and sailings offer eio also solicits lessthan container load lcl freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the companys revenues as an ocean freight forwarder are also derived from commissions paid by the carrier and revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide such as preparing documentation procuring insurance arranging for packing and crating services and providing consultation the company does not own vessels and generally does not physically handle the cargoocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in 2009 2011 and 2012 and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volume in 2012 was comparable to 2011 many carriers took delivery of new ships which created excess capacity this excessive capacity caused most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityorder management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization supplier performance and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves the taking of cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and consolidating these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers data integrity is an increasingly critical function of order management efficient data management is a byproduct of our operational processes2customs brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 42 40 and 39 percent of the companys 2012 2011 and 2010 consolidated net revenues respectively as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery the company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution inventory management and time definite transportation services none of these other services are currently individually significant to the companys net revenuesthe company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles as a freight forwarder however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competing forwarder conversely shipments handled by the company as a forwarder may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customerthe company also provides custom clearances for goods moving by rail and truck between the united states canada andor mexico the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive servicethe companys whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for highend customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projectsmarketing and customersthe company provides specific solutions tailored to each customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliersthe companys efforts are focused on optimizing our customers supply chains therefore the companys marketing efforts target professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and implementation in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retentionthe company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling the companys services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its successthe goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment retail goods machine and automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of the companys business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers the company has also established industry vertical teams located throughout our network that focus on retail and fashion oil and energy aviation and aerospace and healthcare historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the companys net revenuescompetitionthe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areasthe primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting the customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between the customers systems and the companys systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transitmanagement believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that will meet these customer demands management believes that the companys existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competesunlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same accounting and transportation computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge 3for many of the companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitionsthe companys ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantage and account for historical growth that competitors have generally matched only through acquisitioncurrency and other risk factorsthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agentsin addition the companys ability to provide service to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions or trade accords could affect the companys business in unpredictable waysseasonalityhistorically the companys operating results have been subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the companys international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periodsenvironmentalin the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2013employeesat january 31 2013

the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governmentsthe company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the companys ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required licensethe war on terror and governments overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require various degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to potential customers vendors and employees the companys position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the companys servicescargo liabilitywhen acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 special drawing rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liabilitywhen acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume cargo liability in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability6when providing warehouse and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per lot  which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track

suppliers in recent years many of the companys third party service providers have incurred significant operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers and space allotment made available to the company by assetbased carriers could affect the company in unpredictable ways including volatility of pricing and challenge the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitability  predictability of results the company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting shortterm customer requirements however longterm customer satisfaction depends upon the companys ability to meet these unpredictable shortterm customer requirements personnel costs the companys single largest variable expense are always less flexible in the very near term as the company must staff to meet uncertain demand as a result shortterm operating results could be disproportionately affected a significant portion of the companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the companys revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the companys control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the companys stock  foreign operations the majority of the companys revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states to maintain a global service network the company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations in addition the company operates in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws rules regulations and decrees of the united states including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and of all other countries in which the company conducts business as well as trade control laws or laws regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions and antiboycott laws and regulations compliance with these laws rules regulations and decrees is dependent on the companys employees subcontractors agents third party brokers and customers whose individual actions could violate these laws rules regulations and decrees failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses damages to the companys reputation and restrictions on its ability to conduct business7risk factors discussion and potential significance  key personnel the company is a service business the quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the companys employees identifying training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability continued loyalty to the company will not be assured by contract the company believes that its compensation programs which have been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity are one of the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating its performance from that of many of its competitors significant changes to its compensation programs could affect the companys performance  technology increasingly the company must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses future results depend upon the companys success in the cost effective development maintenance and integration of secure communication and information systems technologies including those acquired from and maintained by third parties as the company and its customers continue to increase reliance on these systems the risks also increase the company has implemented processes and procedures to mitigate these risks but these measures do not guarantee the prevention of a serious negative event in the future any significant disruptions to these systems for any reason which could include equipment or network failures power outages sabotage employee error or other actions cyberattacks or other security breaches geopolitical activity or natural disasters would have a material negative effect on the companys results and could include loss of revenue business disruptions loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information legal claims and proceedings reporting delays or errors interference with regulatory reporting significant remediation costs an increase in costs to protect the companys systems and technology and damage to its reputation  growth to date the company has relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition future results will depend upon the companys ability to continue to grow internally or to demonstrate the ability to successfully identify and integrate nondilutive acquisitions  regulatory environment the company is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which the company operates many of these regulations are complex and require various degrees of interpretation and increase the companys costs the current business environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and oversight the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and potentially unforeseen consequences in reaction to the global war on terror governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations these regulations are multilayered increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements amongst various governmental authorities furthermore the implementation of these regulations including deadlines and substantive requirements is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries realistic ability to comply failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations or the failure breach or compromise of the companys policies and procedures or those of its subcontractors or agents may result in increased operating costs damage to the companys reputation restrictions on operations andor fines and penalties  competition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities additionally most larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service many customers regularly put their logistics services out for bid in order to improve their pricing and contractual terms  taxes the company is subject to many taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in many of these jurisdictions the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules including interpretations of those rules the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from the companys tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact its financial results  litigationinvestigations as a multinational corporation the company is subject to formal or informal investigations or litigation from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which it does business these investigations and other periodic investigations may require management time and could cause the company to incur substantial additional legal and related costs which may include fines andor penalties that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations and operating cash flows the company may also become subject to other civil litigation arising from such investigations or litigation including but not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits and derivative claims made on behalf of the plaintiffs   risk factors discussion and potential significance   8economic conditions the global economy and capital and credit markets continue to experience uncertainty and volatility unfavorable changes in economic conditions may result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect the companys revenues and operating results as experienced in 2009 and 2012 these conditions may adversely affect certain of the companys customers carriers and third party services providers were that to occur the companys revenues and net earnings could also be adversely affected should customers ability to pay deteriorate additional bad debts may be incurred these unfavorable conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advanced notice the company often times cannot pass these rate increases on to its customers in the same time frame if at all as a result the companys yields and margins can be negatively impacted as experienced in 2012   catastrophic events a disruption or failure of the companys

business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight the company acts as a customs broker in all domestic offices and in many of its international offices the company also provides additional services for its customers including valueadded distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation domestic time definite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business the company does not own or operate aircraft or steamshipsinternational trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted nor can the company predict the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the companys business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs rising costs in general political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the companys pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers which has resulted in a compression of the companys operating margins the company has also experienced a decrease in airfreight tonnage in 2012 compared to prior years as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible absent of any meaningful improvement in these conditions the company expects similar trends to continue in the near term13the company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsthe company is managed along three geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific and europe africa nearmiddle east and indian subcontinent emair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the companys business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to look at one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the companys overall success on a standalone basisthe companys operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the companys strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the networkas a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue or yield by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselvescustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has officesthe companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with governmental agencies and assetbased carriers involved in global trade has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism as each carrier labors to comply with additional governmental regulations implementing security policies and procedures inherent conflicts emerge which can and do affect global trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory the airline and ocean steamship line industries have incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the companys business in unpredictable wayshistorically the companys operating results have been subject to a seasonal trend when measured on a quarterly basis the first quarter has traditionally been the weakest and the third and fourth quarters have traditionally been the strongest this pattern is the result of or is influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces in addition this historical quarterly trend has been influenced by the growth and diversification of the companys international network and service offerings the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns if any will continue in future periodsa significant portion of the companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the companys revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the companys control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the companys stockthe company operates in 63 countries throughout the world in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are tied directly to the global economy the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the companys greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demandstotal dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer servicecompliance with company policies and government regulationsaggressive marketing of all of the companys service offeringsongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal meanscreation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvementindividual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change is required a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward and14continuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of our customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make our employees more efficient and more effectivethe company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a real world environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating losses these losses must be made up from future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a careerany failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the companys continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond our control consequently management spends the majority of its time focused on creating an environment where employees can learn and develop while also improving systems and taking preventative action to reduce exposure to negative events and risks the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result our focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture of welltrained employees and managers that are prepared to identify and react to subtle changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emergecritical accounting estimatesa summary of the companys significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this reportmanagement believes that the nature of the companys business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areasaccounts receivable valuationaccrual of costs related to ancillary services the company providesaccrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the freight related exposure which the company has selfinsuredaccrual of various tax liabilitiesaccrual of loss contingencies andcalculation of sharebased compensation expensethese estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of sharebased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the companys transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reportedthe outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year as described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for sharebased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the companys stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting perioddetermining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the companys historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be materialthe companys expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the companys stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the companys historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patterns15the fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstancesresults of operationsthe following table shows the consolidated net revenues revenues less transportation expenses attributable to the companys principal services and the companys expenses for 2012 2011 and 2010 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues of the relative importance of the companys principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include only the commissions and fees actually earned by the company  2012 2011 2010 in thousands amount percentof netrevenues amount percentof netrevenues amount

airfreight services net revenues was primarily due to a 6 decrease in airfreight tonnage and a 7 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues decreased 7 16 and 13 respectively in 2012 as compared with 2011 while airfreight export tonnage decreased 12 2 and 6 in north america asia pacific and europe respectively the decline in airfreight tonnage in 2012 can be attributed to an overall decrease in the global airfreight market as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and customers improve supplychain efficiency by utilizing deferred airfreight or ocean freight whenever possible and a lower level of customer specific infrastructure and project related tonnage than experienced in 2011 net revenue per kilo was lower in 2012 compared to 2011 as carriers reduced overall available capacity to manage market pricing and the company was unable to implement corresponding price adjustments to its customers in a timely manner ocean freight and ocean services net revenues decreased 1 in 2012 as compared with 2011 north america ocean freight net revenues increased 2 while asia pacific and europe ocean freight net revenues decreased by 3 and 1 respectively in 2012 as compared with 2011ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the largest component of the companys ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 47 and 50 of ocean freight net revenue in 2012 and 2011 respectivelyocean freight consolidation net revenue decreased 7 in 2012 as compared with 2011 primarily due to a 4 decrease in net revenue per container and a 2 decrease in container volume as measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feus the decrease in net revenue per container resulted from the timing of significant increases in buy rates implemented by carriers requirements to provide notice of these increases to customers and the companys ability to implement commensurate increases in its sell rates direct ocean freight forwarding and order management net revenues which are primarily feebased increased 8 and 2 respectively in 2012 as compared with 2011 due to an increase in market share and volumecustoms brokerage and other services net revenues increased 2 in 2012 as compared with 2011 primarily as a result of an increase in domestic time definite transportation volumes customers continue to seek out customs brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environment16overhead expensessalaries and related costs increased 02 in 2012 as compared with 2011 primarily due to a higher average number of employees increases in base salaries payroll taxes and medical costs which were partially offset by a decline in bonuses earned due to lower operating incomesalaries and related costs and stockbased compensation expense as a percentage of net revenue are as follows   years ended december

relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests however the results in 2012 were not consistent with this historical relationship primarily due to a decrease in net revenues while the average number of employees increased to support customer driven initiatives enhance information systems and expand certain products bonuses to field and executive management in 2012 consistent with declines in branch and company performance were down 9 and 14 respectively as compared with 2011 the companys management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performancebecause the companys management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the companys services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the companys compensation programother overhead expenses increased 5 in 2012 as compared with 2011 this increase is primarily due to the european commissions finding against the company for anticompetitive behavior which resulted in a fine of 414 million 55 million higher legal expenses an adjustment for certain foreign indirect withholding taxes of approximately 59 million claims related to increased liability limits and cost associated with maintaining and enhancing our information systems the company also decided not to continue pursuit of certain real estate development projects recorded under construction in process and expensed the associated costs of 3 million as a component of rent and occupancy expensethese increases

export tonnage increased 5 and 4 in north america and europe respectively and decreased 3 in asia pacific net revenue per kilo was higher as the company benefited from intermittent buying opportunities created from excess carrier capacity primarily in asia after the first quarter of 2011 the company experienced a decline in quarterly airfreight volumes as compared to 2010 and the customary peak season surge in the fourth quarter did not materialize ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 13 in 2011 as compared with 2010 north america asia pacific and europe

ocean freight consolidation which represented 50 and 51 respectively of ocean freight net revenueocean freight consolidation net revenue increased 12 in 2011 as compared with 2010 primarily due to a

income tax expensethe companys consolidated effective income tax rate in 2011 was 395 as compared to 389 for 2010 the higher consolidated effective income tax rate for 2011 as compared with 2010 is primarily the result of higher state tax rates and a lower tax benefit received for disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options for 2011 as compared with 2010currency and other risk factorsthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company enters into foreign currency hedging transactions only in limited locations where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the companys ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2012 2011 and 2010 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 net foreign currency losses were 5 million 2 million and 2 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectivelyinternational air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry some of which have significantly more resources than the company however the companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive forcethe primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry larger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide network18liquidity and capital resourcesthe companys principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 370 million as compared with 457 million for 2011 this 87 million decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts and lower earnings at december 31 2012 working capital was 1515 million including cash and cash equivalents of 1261 million the company had no longterm debt at december 31 2012 management believes that the companys current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligationsthe companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cashas a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these pass through billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problemscash used in investing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 was 47 million as compared

exercises the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared with the same period in 2011 is primarily the result of this policy and additional discretionary repurchases of 57 million shares at an average per share price of 3700 during 2012 and 2011 the company paid dividends of 56 per share and 50 per share respectivelythe company has a

million were held by the companys nonunited states subsidiaries of which 55 million was held in banks in the united states earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be

repatriated impact of inflationto date the companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the companys margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain extensive property and equipment and has not otherwise incurred substantial interest ratesensitive indebtedness the company currently has limited direct exposure to increased costs resulting from increases in interest ratesoffbalance

disclosures about market riskthe company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the companys exposure to these risks is presented belowforeign exchange riskthe company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the companys earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso and canadian dollarforeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the companys functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2012 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 40 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 33 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptionsas of december 31 2012 the company had less than 1 million of net unsettled intercompany transactions the company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the companys ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2012 was insignificant net foreign currency losses were 5 million 2 million and 2 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2012 and 2011 the company instead follows a policy of accelerating international currency settlements to manage foreign exchange risk relative to intercompany billings the majority of intercompany billings are resolved within 30 daysinterest rate riskat december 31 2012 the company had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 1261 million of which 803 million was invested at various shortterm market interest rates the company had no significant shortterm borrowings at december 31 2012 a hypothetical change in the interest rate of 10 basis points at december 31 2012 would not have a significant impact on the companys earningsin managements opinion there has been no material change in the companys interest rate risk exposure between 2012 and 201120item 8  financial statements and

services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsas a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue or yield by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselvesairfreight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as f9the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight chargesbased upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues an hawb or an hobl are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same timerevenues realized in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue an hawb or an hobl include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed these revenues are recognized upon completion of the servicescustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company may perform multiple services these services include destination breakbulk services and value added ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the servicetypically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as doortodoor service this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy perhaps supplemented by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the companys branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate is done in an objective manner on a relative selling price basisthe company presents revenues net of sales and valueadded
