aircraft or steamships the following charts show the companys 2014 revenues and net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operating expenses by service type    beginning in 1981 the companys primary business focus was on airfreight shipments from asia to the united states and related customs brokerage and other services in the mid1980s the company began to expand its service capabilities in export airfreight ocean freight and distribution services today the company offers a complete range of global logistics services to a diversified group of customers both in terms of industry specialization and geographic location as opportunities for profitable growth arise the company plans to create new offices while the company has historically expanded

identifiable assets capital expenditures depreciation and amortization and equity attributable to the geographic areas in which the company conducts its business see note 10 to the consolidated financial statementsairfreight servicesairfreight services accounted for approximately 42 percent of the companys total revenues and 34 percent of total net revenues in each of the last three years when performing airfreight services the company typically acts either as a freight consolidator or as an agent for the airline which carries the shipment when acting as a freight consolidator the company purchases cargo space from airlines on a volume basis and resells that space to its customers at lower rates than the customers could obtain directly from airlines on an individual shipment the company issues a house airway bill hawb to its customers as its contract of carriage and separately receives a master airway bill from the airlines when the freight is physically tendered when moving shipments between points where the nature or volume of business does not facilitate consolidation the company receives and forwards individual shipments as the agent of the airline which carries the shipment whether acting as a consolidator or agent the company offers its customers knowledge of optimum routing familiarity with local business practices knowledge of export and import documentation and procedures the ability to arrange for ancillary services and assistance with space availability in periods of peak demandin its airfreight operations the company receives shipments from its customers determines the routing consolidates shipments bound for a particular airport distribution point and selects the airline for transportation to the distribution point at the distribution point the company or its agent arranges for the consolidated lot to be broken down into its component shipments and for the transportation of the individual shipments to their final destinationsthe company estimates its average airfreight consolidation weighs approximately 2800 pounds and a typical consolidation includes merchandise from several shippers because shipment by air is relatively expensive compared with ocean transportation air shipments are generally characterized by a high valuetoweight ratio the need for rapid delivery or boththe company typically delivers shipments from a company warehouse at the origin to the airline after consolidating the freight into containers or onto pallets shipments normally arrive at the destination distribution point within fortyeight hours after such delivery during peak shipment periods cargo space available from the scheduled air carriers can be limited and backlogs of freight shipments may occur when these conditions exist the company may charter aircraft to meet customer demandthe company consolidates individual shipments based on weight and volume characteristics in costeffective combinations typically as the weight or volume of a shipment increases the cost per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter charged by the company decreases the rates charged by airlines also generally decrease as the weight or volume of the shipment increases as a result by aggregating shipments and presenting them to an airline as a single shipment the company is able to obtain a lower rate per poundkilo or cubic inchcentimeter than that which it charges to its customers for the individual shipment while generally offering the customer a lower rate than could be obtained from the airline for an unconsolidated shipmentthe companys airfreight net revenues for a consolidated shipment include the differential between the rate charged to the company by an airline and the rate which the company charges to its customers commissions paid to the company by the airline carrying the freight and fees for ancillary services such ancillary services provided by the company include preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws when the company acts as an agent for an airline handling an unconsolidated shipment its net revenues are primarily derived from commissions paid by the airline and fees for ancillary services paid by the customermanagement believes that the ownership of aircraft would subject the company to undue business risks including large capital outlays increased fixed operating expenses volatile fuel prices problems of fully utilizing aircraft and competition with airlines because the company relies on commercial airlines to transport its shipments changes in carrier financial stability policies and practices such as pricing payment terms scheduling capacity and frequency of service may adversely affect its business over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt carriers continue to merge and consolidate operations and reduce available capacity to improve financial results some airlines have significantly reduced their reliance on cargoonly aircraft to service their airfreight customers as high technology consumer products continue to decrease in size and weight and as customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency seek to reduce overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and by utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the reduction in capacity allows assetbased carriers to raise rates in the face of declining or stable demand when fewer planes are flying the company has fewer shipping options from which to craft service offerings to meet customers needs the combination of reduced capacity higher rates and less frequent flights could challenge the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityrecent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact airfreight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 airfreight customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors including that some air carriers having hedged fuel costs through 2015 presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its airfreight revenues and costs to decline should lower fuel prices persist the company would not expect an adverse effect on airfreight net revenues resulting from a decline in oil pricesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight services accounted for approximately 33 percent of the companys total revenues and 23 percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years the company operates expeditors international ocean inc eio an ocean transportation intermediary sometimes referred to as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc which specializes in ocean freight services in most major trade lanes in the world eio also provides service on a smaller scale to and from any location where the company has an office or agent ocean freight services are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation eio direct ocean forwarding and order management 2ocean freight consolidation as an nvocc eio contracts with ocean shipping lines to obtain transportation for a fixed number of containers between various points during a specified time period at an agreed rate eio handles full container loads for customers that do not want to contract directly with the ocean carriers and for those customers that prefer to supplement their carrier strategy with an nvocc eio also solicits lessthan container load lcl freight to fill the containers and charges lower rates than those available directly from shipping lines the company issues a house ocean bill hobl to customers as the contract of carriage and receives a separate master ocean bill of lading mobl when freight is physically tendered revenues from fees charged to customers for ancillary services which the company may provide include the preparation of shipping and customs documentation packing crating insurance services negotiation of letters of credit and the preparation of documentation to comply with local export laws direct ocean forwarding when the customer contracts directly with the steamship line the company acts as an agent of the customer and derives its revenues from commissions paid by the steamship line and handling fees paid by the customer in such arrangements no hobl is issued by the company the carrier issues a mobl directly to the customer who employs the company to create documentation manage shipment information and arrange various services to facilitate the shipment of goods the mobl shows the customer as the shipperorder management order management provides services which manage origin consolidation supplier performance carrier allocation carrier performance container management document management destination management and posku visibility through a web based application customers have the ability to monitor and report against near real time status of purchase orders from the date of creation through final delivery item quantities required ship dates commodity descriptions estimated vs actual exfactory dates container utilization and document visibility are many of the managed functions that are visible and reportable via the web order management is available for various modes of transportation including ocean air truck and rail order management revenues are derived from services provided to the shipper as well as management fees associated with managing purchase order execution against customer specific rules one basic function of order management involves arranging cargo from many suppliers in a particular origin and consolidating these shipments into the fewest possible number of containers to maximize space utilization and minimize cost through origin consolidation customers can reduce the number of containers shipped by putting more product in larger and fewer containers ocean carriers incurred substantial operating losses in recent years and many are highly leveraged with debt while the overall global volumes have increased slightly over recent years many carriers continue to take delivery of new ships which creates excess capacity this excessive capacity causes most carriers to redeploy ships and modify sailing schedules to improve financial results the potential combination of reduced sailing schedules and pricing volatility could impact the companys ability to maintain historical unitary profitabilityrecent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact ocean freight buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 ocean freight customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the

decline in oil pricescustoms brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services accounted for approximately 25 percent of the companys total revenues and 43 percent of total net revenues in each of the past three years as a customs broker the company assists importers to clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the importer arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery changing regulations the commodities being cleared and the time sensitive nature of the border brokerage business require the company to continue to make enhancements to its systems in order to provide competitive service the company provides customs clearance services in connection with many of the shipments it handles in its transportation services however substantial customs brokerage revenues are derived from customers that elect to use a competitor for transportation services conversely shipments handled by the company may be processed by another customs broker selected by the customerthe company also provides other value added services at destination such as warehousing and distribution timedefinite transportation services transcon and consulting services none of which are currently individually significant to the companys total revenues and net revenues the companys distribution and warehousing services include distribution center management inventory management order fulfillment returns programs and order level services transcon is a multimodal product which offers timedefinite intracontinental transportation solutions often by ground and other specialty handling services the companys whollyowned subsidiary expeditors tradewin llc responds to customer driven requests for customs consulting services fees for these nontransactional services are based upon hourly billing rates and bids for mutually agreed projectsmarketing and customersthe company provides specific solutions tailored to each customers individual business needs from order inception through order delivery although the domestic importer usually designates the logistics company and the services that will be required the foreign shipper may also participate in this selection process therefore the company coordinates its marketing program to reach both domestic importers and their overseas suppliersthe companys efforts are focused on optimizing its customers supply chains therefore the companys marketing efforts target professionals in logistics international and domestic transportation customs compliance and purchasing departments of existing and potential customers the district manager of each office is responsible for marketing sales coordination and operations in the area in which he or she is located all employees are responsible for customer service and retentionthe company staffs its offices largely with managers and other key personnel who are citizens of the nations in which they operate and who have extensive experience in global logistics marketing and customer service staffs are responsible for marketing and selling the companys services directly to customers and prospects who may select or influence the selection of logistics service providers and for ensuring that customers receive timely and efficient service the company believes that its expertise in supplying solutions customized to the needs of its customers its emphasis on coordinating its origin and destination customer service and marketing activities and the incentives it gives to its managers have been important elements of its success 3the goods handled by the company are generally a function of the products which dominate international trade between any particular origin and destination shipments of computers and components electronic and consumer goods medical equipment pharmaceutical products retail goods automotive parts aviation parts industrial equipment and oil and energy equipment comprise a significant percentage of the companys business typical import customers include retailers and distributors of consumer electronics department store chains clothing and shoe wholesalers and hightech industrial and automotive manufacturers the company has also established industry vertical teams located throughout its network that focus on aviation and aerospace healthcare oil and energy and retail and fashion historically no single customer has accounted for five percent or more of the companys net revenuescompetitionthe global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local competitors still maintain a strong market presence in certain areasthe primary competitive factors in the global logistics services industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with the prices of others in the industry larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers and implement more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management accordingly timely and accurate information integrated into customer service capabilities are a significant factor in attracting and retaining customers this information integrated into customer service capabilities includes customized electronic data interchange edi online freight tracing and tracking applications and customized reporting customized edi applications allow the transfer of key information between customers service providers and the companys systems freight tracing and tracking applications provide customers with near real time visibility to the location transit time and estimated delivery time of inventory in transitmanagement believes that the ability to develop and deliver innovative solutions to meet customers increasingly sophisticated information requirements is a critical factor in the ongoing success of the company the company devotes a significant amount of resources towards the maintenance and enhancement of systems that currently meet these customer demands management believes that the companys existing systems are competitive with the systems currently in use by other logistics services companies with which it competesunlike many of its competitors who have tended to grow by merger and acquisition the company operates the same transportation and accounting computer software running on a common hardware platform in all of its fullservice locations small and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop these customized systems historically growth through aggressive acquisition has proven to be a challenge for many of the companys competitors and typically involves the purchase of significant goodwill as a result the company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitionsthe companys ability to attract retain and motivate highly qualified personnel with experience in global logistics services is an essential if not the most important element of its ability to compete in the industry to this end the company has adopted incentive compensation programs which make percentages of an operating units net revenues or profits available to managers for distribution among key personnel the company believes that these incentive compensation programs combined with its experienced personnel and its ability to coordinate global marketing efforts provide it with a distinct competitive advantagecurrency and dependence on service providersthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agentsin addition the companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines ocean steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory however changes in the financial stability and operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulation or deregulation efforts modernization of the regulations governing customs brokerage andor changes in governmental restrictions quota restrictions or trade accords could affect the companys business in unpredictable waysseasonalityhistorically the companys operating results have been subject to seasonal trends with the first quarter being the weakest and the third and fourth quarters being the strongest this pattern has been the result of or influenced by numerous factors including weather patterns national holidays consumer demand new product launches economic conditions and a myriad of other similar and subtle forces the company cannot accurately forecast many of these factors nor can the company estimate accurately the relative influence of any particular factor and as a result there can be no assurance that historical patterns will continue in future periods 4environmentalin the united states the company is subject to federal state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials and emissions into the environment or otherwise for the protection of the environment similar laws apply in many other jurisdictions in which the company operates although current operations have not been significantly affected by compliance with these environmental laws governments service providers and customers are becoming increasingly sensitive to environmental issues and the company cannot predict what impact future environmental regulations may have on its business the company does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures for environmental control purposes during 2015employeesat january 31 2015 the company employed approximately 14670 people 5290 in the united states and 990 in the balance

regulation and securitywith respect to the companys activities in the air transportation industry in the united states it is subject to regulation by the transportation security administration tsa of the department of homeland security as an indirect air carrier all united states indirect air carriers are required to maintain prescribed security procedures and are subject to periodic audits by tsa the companys overseas offices and agents are licensed as airfreight forwarders in their respective countries of operation the company is licensed in each of its offices or in the case of its newer offices has made application for a license as an airfreight forwarder by the international air transport association iata iata is a voluntary association of airlines and air transport related entities which prescribes certain operating procedures for airfreight forwarders acting as agents for its members the majority of the companys airfreight forwarding business is conducted with airlines which are iata membersthe company is licensed as an ocean transportation intermediary oti sometimes referred to as nvoccnonvessel operating common carrier by the federal maritime commission fmc the fmc has established certain qualifications for shipping agents including certain surety bonding requirements the fmc is also responsible for the economic regulation of otinvocc activity originating or terminating in the united  6states to comply with these economic regulations vessel operators and nvoccs such as eio are required to file tariffs electronically which establish the rates to be charged for the movement of specified commodities into and out of the united states the fmc has the power to enforce these regulations by assessing penaltiesthe company is licensed as a customs broker by customs and border protection cbp of the department of homeland security nationally and in each us customs district in which it does business all united states customs brokers are required to maintain prescribed records and are subject to periodic audits by cbp in other jurisdictions in which the company performs customs clearance services the company is licensed by the appropriate governmental authority where such license is required to perform these services the company participates in various governmental supply chain security programs such as the customstrade partnership against terrorism ctpat in the united states and additional security initiatives such as authorized economic operator aeo as they continue to be enacted by different governmentsthe company does not believe that current united states and foreign governmental regulations impose significant economic restraint upon its business operations in general the company conducts its business activities in each country through a wholly or majorityowned subsidiary corporation that is organized and existing under the laws of that country however the regulations of foreign governments can impose barriers to the companys ability to provide the full range of its business activities in a wholly or majority united statesowned subsidiary for example foreign ownership of a customs brokerage business is prohibited in some jurisdictions and less frequently the ownership of the licenses required for freight forwarding andor freight consolidation is restricted to local entities when the company encounters this sort of governmental restriction it works to establish a legal structure that meets the requirements of the local regulations while also giving the company the substantive operating and economic advantages that would be available in the absence of such regulation this can be accomplished by creating a joint venture or exclusive agency relationship with a qualified local entity that holds the required licensethe continuing global terrorist threat and governments overriding concern for the safety of passengers and citizens who import andor export goods into and out of their respective countries has resulted in a proliferation of cargo security and other regulations over the past several years many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation while these regulations have already created a marked difference in the security and other arrangements required to move shipments around the globe regulations are expected to become more stringent in the future as governments look for ways to minimize the exposure of their citizens to potential terror related incidents the company and its competitors in the transportation business may be required to incorporate security and other procedures within their scope of services to a far greater degree than has been required in the past the company feels that increased security and other requirements may involve further investments in technology and more sophisticated screening procedures being applied to cargo customers vendors and employees the companys position is that any increased cost of compliance with security regulations will be passed through to those who are beneficiaries of the companys servicescargo liabilitywhen acting as an airfreight consolidator the company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this legal liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 19 special drawing rights per kilo unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge except in the absence of an appropriate airway bill or if the loss or damage is caused by willful misconduct the airline which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when acting solely as the agent of the airline or shipper the company does not assume any contractual liability for loss or damage to shipments tendered to the airline when acting as an ocean freight consolidator the company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value 500 per package or customary freight unit unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the steamship line which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent in its ocean freight forwarding and customs clearance operations the company does not assume liability for lost or damaged shipments when providing ground transportation services as a carrier the company assumes a carriers liability for lost or damaged shipments this liability is typically limited by contract to the lower of the transaction value or the released value generally 050 per pound though the released value can vary from country to country unless the customer declares a higher value and pays a surcharge the ground carrier which the company utilizes to make the actual shipment is generally liable to the company in the same manner and to the same extent when providing warehousing and distribution services the company limits its legal liability by contract and tariff to an amount generally equal to the lower of fair value or 050 per pound with a maximum of 50 per lot  which is defined as the smallest unit that the warehouse is required to track in certain circumstances the company will assume additional limited liability the company maintains cargo legal liability insurance covering claims for losses attributable to missing or damaged shipments for which it is legally liable the company also maintains insurance coverage for the property of others which is stored in company warehouse facilities this insurance coverage is provided by a vermont us based insurance entity whollyowned by the company the coverage is fronted and reinsured by a global insurance company the total risk retained by the company in 2014 was 5 million in addition the company is licensed as an insurance broker

trade and security regulations    wars strikes civil unrest acts of terrorism and other conflicts    natural disasters and pandemics    changes in consumer attitudes regarding goods made in countries other than their own   changes in availability of credit    changes in the price and readily available quantities of oil and other petroleumrelated products and    increased global concerns regarding working conditions and environmental sustainability  third party service providers as a nonasset based provider of global logistics services the company depends on a variety of assetbased third party providers the quality and profitability of the company depend upon effective selection management and discipline of third party providers in recent years many of the companys third party service providers have incurred significant operating losses and are highly leveraged with debt changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers and space allotment made available to the company by assetbased carriers could affect the company in unpredictable ways any combination of reduced airfreight or ocean freight capacity pricing volatility or more limited carrier transportation schedules could negatively impact the companys ability to maintain historical profitability the companys freight carriers are subject to increasingly stringent laws protecting the environment which could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on the companys business future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in transportation industries which in turn could increase the companys purchased transportation costs if the company is unable to pass such costs on to its customers its business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected   predictability of results the company is not aware of any accurate means of forecasting shortterm customer requirements however longterm customer satisfaction depends upon the companys ability to meet these unpredictable shortterm customer requirements personnel costs the companys single largest expense are always less flexible in the very near term as the company must staff to meet uncertain demand as a result shortterm operating results could be disproportionately affected a significant portion of the companys revenues are derived from customers in retail industries whose shipping patterns are tied closely to consumer demand and from customers in industries whose shipping patterns are dependent upon justintime production schedules therefore the timing of the companys revenues are to a large degree impacted by factors out of the companys control such as a sudden change in consumer demand for retail goods product launches andor manufacturing production delays additionally many customers ship a significant portion of their goods at or near the end of a quarter and therefore the company may not learn of a shortfall in revenues until late in a quarter to the extent that a shortfall in revenues or earnings was not expected by securities analysts or investors any such shortfall from levels predicted by securities analysts or investors could have an immediate and adverse effect on the trading price of the companys stock  foreign operations the majority of the companys revenues and operating income comes from operations conducted outside the united states to maintain a global service network the company may be required to operate in hostile locations and in dangerous situations in addition the company operates in parts of the world where common business practices could constitute violations of the anticorruption laws rules regulations and decrees of the united states including the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and of all other countries in which the company conducts business as well as trade control laws or laws regulations and executive orders imposing embargoes and sanctions and antiboycott laws and regulations compliance with these laws rules regulations and decrees is dependent on the companys employees service providers agents third party brokers and customers whose individual actions could violate these laws rules regulations and decrees failure to comply could result in substantial penalties and additional expenses damage to the companys reputation and restrictions on its ability to conduct business 8risk factors discussion and potential significance  key personnel the company is a service business the quality of this service is directly related to the quality of the companys employees identifying training and retaining key employees is essential to continued growth and future profitability effective succession planning is an important element of the companys programs failure to ensure an effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder the companys ability to execute on its business strategies and level of service senior management of the company includes employees with long tenures many of whom are approaching retirement age and some of whom announced their retirement in 2014 the loss of the services of one or more key personnel could have an adverse effect on the companys business the company must continue to develop and retain management personnel to address issues of succession planning the company believes that its compensation programs which have been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity are one of the unique characteristics responsible for differentiating its performance from that of many of its competitors significant changes to its compensation programs could affect the companys performance and ability to attract and retain key personnel continued loyalty to the company will not be assured by contract  technology the company relies heavily and must compete based upon the flexibility and sophistication of the technologies utilized in performing its core businesses future results depend upon the companys success in the cost effective development maintenance and integration of secure communication and information systems technologies including those acquired from and maintained by third parties as the company and its customers continue to increase reliance on these systems and as additional features are added the risks also increase the company has begun upgrading many of its systems including core operations and accounting this process is inherently complex and if not managed properly could lead to disruptions in the companys operations the company has implemented processes and procedures to mitigate these risks however these measures cannot assure the prevention of a serious negative event in the future any significant disruptions to the companys global systems or the internet for any reason which could include equipment or network failures power outages sabotage employee error or other actions cyberattacks or other security breaches geopolitical activity or natural disasters would have a material negative effect on the companys results and could include loss of revenue business disruptions including the inability to timely process shipments loss of property including trade secrets and confidential information legal claims and proceedings reporting delays or errors interference with regulatory reporting significant remediation costs an increase in costs to protect the companys systems and technology and damage to its reputation  growth the company has historically relied primarily upon organic growth and has tended to avoid growth through acquisition future results will depend upon the companys ability to anticipate and adapt to constantly evolving supply chain requirements and innovations to continue to grow organically the company must gain profitable market share and successfully develop and market new service offerings when investment opportunities arise the companys success will be dependent on its ability to evaluate and integrate the acquisitions   regulatory environment the company is affected by ever increasing regulations from a number of sources in the united states and in foreign locations in which the company operates many of these regulations are complex and require varying degrees of interpretation and increase the companys costs the current business environment tends to stress the avoidance of risk through regulation and oversight the effect of which is likely to be unforeseen costs and potentially unforeseen consequences in reaction to the continuing global terrorist threat governments around the world are continuously enacting or updating security regulations these regulations are multilayered increasingly technical in nature and characterized by a lack of harmonization of substantive requirements amongst various governmental authorities furthermore the implementation of these regulations including deadlines and substantive requirements is driven by political urgencies rather than the industries realistic ability to comply failure to consistently and timely comply with these regulations or the failure breach or compromise of the companys policies and procedures or those of its service providers or agents may result in increased operating costs damage to the companys reputation restrictions on operations andor fines and penalties   9risk factors discussion and potential significancecompetition the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of companies competing in one or more segments of the industry but the number of firms with a global network that offer a full complement of logistics services is more limited many of these competitors have significantly more resources than the company depending on the location of the shipper and the importer the company must compete against both the niche players and larger entities including some carriers the primary competitive factors are price and quality of service many larger customers utilize the services of multiple logistics providers customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial condition   taxes the company is subject to many taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions in many of these jurisdictions the tax laws are very complex and are open to different interpretations and application tax authorities frequently implement new taxes and change their tax rates and rules including interpretations of those rules the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities although the company believes its tax estimates are reasonable the final determination of tax audits including transfer pricing inquiries could be materially different from the companys tax provisions and accruals and negatively impact its financial results  litigationinvestigations as a multinational corporation the company is subject to formal or informal investigations or litigation from governmental authorities or others in the countries in which it does business these investigations and other periodic investigations may require management time and could cause the company to incur substantial additional legal and related costs which may include fines andor penalties that could have a material impact on the companys results of operations and operating cash flows the company may also become subject to other civil litigation arising from such investigations or litigation including but not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits and derivative claims made on behalf of the plaintiffs   economic conditions the global economy and capital and credit markets continue to experience uncertainty and volatility unfavorable changes in economic conditions may result in lower freight volumes and adversely affect the companys revenues and operating results as experienced in 2009 and 2012 these conditions may adversely affect certain of the companys customers carriers and third party services providers were that to occur the companys revenues and net earnings could also be adversely affected should customers ability to pay deteriorate additional bad debts may be incurred these unfavorable conditions can create situations where rate increases charged by carriers and other service providers are implemented with little or no advanced notice the company often times cannot pass these rate increases on to its customers in the same time frame if at all as a result the companys yields and margins can be negatively impacted as experienced in 2012 and parts of 2013 and 2014 particularly with ocean freight   catastrophic events a disruption or failure of the companys systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake weather event cyberattack terrorist attack strike civil unrest pandemic or other catastrophic event could cause delays in providing services or performing other missioncritical functions the companys corporate headquarters and certain other critical business operations are in the seattle washington area which is near

and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsoverviewexpeditors international of washington inc is a global logistics company the companys services include air and ocean freight consolidation and forwarding customs clearance warehousing and distribution purchase order management vendor consolidation timedefinite transportation services cargo insurance and other logistics solutions the company does not compete for overnight courier or small parcel business as a nonasset based carrier the company does not own or operate transportation assetsthe company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsthe company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services on a wholesale basis from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers on a retail basis the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselves the most significant drivers of changes in gross revenues and related transportation expenses are volume sell rates and buy rates volume has a similar effect on the change in both gross revenues and related transportation expenses in each of the companys three primary sources of revenue 14in most cases the company acts as an indirect carrier when acting as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments in these transactions the company is the primary obligor and is required to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier and has credit risk the company is the principal in these transactions and reports revenue and the related expenses on a gross basis for revenues earned in other capacities for instance when the company does not issue a hawb or a hobl or otherwise acts solely as an agent for the shipper only the commissions and fees earned for such services are included in revenues in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenuecustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing and filing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery these are complicated functions requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has officesthe company is managed along four geographic areas of responsibility americas asia pacific europe and middle east africa and india mair each area is divided into subregions which are composed of operating units with individual profit and loss responsibility the companys business involves shipments between operating units and typically touches more than one geographic area the nature of the international logistics business necessitates a high degree of communication and cooperation among operating units because of this interrelationship between operating units it is very difficult to examine any one geographic area and draw meaningful conclusions as to its contribution to the companys overall success on a standalone basis the following chart shows net revenues by geographic areas of responsibility for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012the companys operating units share revenue using the same armslength pricing methodologies the company uses when its offices transact business with independent agents the company charges its subsidiaries and affiliates for services rendered in the united states on a cost recovery basis the companys strategy closely links compensation with operating unit profitability individual success is closely linked to cooperation with other operating units within the networkthe mix of services varies by segment based primarily on the import or export orientation of local operations in each region in accordance with the companys revenue recognition policy see note 1 e to the consolidated financial statements of this report almost all freight revenues and related expenses are recorded at origin and shipment profits are split between origin and destination offices by recording a commission fee or profit share revenue at destination and a corresponding commission or profit share expense as a component of origin consolidation costs the asia pacific segment is the companys largest export oriented region and accounted for 49 of revenues and 39 of operating income for the year  15ended december 31 2014 asia pacifics operating income as a percentage of revenue is lower than other segments due to the largely export nature of operations in that regionstrategy and culturethe company has pursued a strategy emphasizing organic growth supplemented by certain strategic acquisitions from the inception of the company management has believed that the elements required for a successful global service organization can only be assured through recruiting training and ultimately retaining superior personnel the companys greatest challenge is now and always has been perpetuating a consistent global corporate culture which demandstotal dedication first and foremost to providing superior customer servicecompliance with company policies and government regulationsaggressive marketing of all of the companys service offeringsongoing development of key employees and management personnel via formal and informal meanscreation of unlimited advancement opportunities for employees dedicated to hard work personal growth and continuous improvementindividual commitment to the identification and mentoring of successors for every key position so that when inevitable change occurs a qualified and welltrained internal candidate is ready to step forward andcontinuous identification design and implementation of system solutions both technological and otherwise to meet and exceed the needs of the companys customers while simultaneously delivering tools to make the companys employees more efficient and more effectivethe company reinforces these values with a compensation system that rewards employees for profitably managing the things they can control this compensation system has been in place since the company became a publicly traded entity there is no limit to how much a key manager can be compensated for success the company believes in a real world environment in every operating unit where individuals are not sheltered from the profit implications of their decisions if these decisions result in operating lossesmanagement must make up these losses with future operating profits in the aggregate before any cash incentive compensation can be earned executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level at the same time the company insists on continued focus on such things as accounts receivable collection cash flow management and credit soundness in an attempt to insulate managers from the sort of catastrophic errors that might end a careerany failure to perpetuate this unique culture on a selfsustained basis throughout the company provides a greater threat to the companys continued success than any external force which would be largely beyond its control the company strongly believes that it is nearly impossible to predict events that in the aggregate could have a positive or a negative impact on future operations as a result managements focus is on building and maintaining a global corporate culture and an environment where welltrained employees and managers are prepared to identify and react to changes as they develop and thereby help the company adapt and thrive as major trends emergethe companys ability to provide services to its customers is highly dependent on good working relationships with a variety of entities including airlines steamship lines ground transportation providers and governmental agencies the significance of maintaining acceptable working relationships with these entities has gained increased importance as a result of ongoing concern over terrorism and increased governmental regulation and oversight of international trade a good reputation helps to develop practical working understandings that will assist in meeting security requirements while minimizing potential international trade obstacles especially as governments promulgate new regulations and increase oversight and enforcement of new and existing laws the company considers its current working relationships with these entities to be satisfactory over the last two years airline profitability has improved though many air carriers remain highly leveraged with debt the ocean steamship line industry has incurred significant losses in recent years and many carriers are highly leveraged with debt this situation has required the company to be increasingly selective in determining which carriers to utilize further changes in the financial stability operating capabilities and capacity of assetbased carriers space allotments available from carriers governmental regulations andor trade accords could adversely affect the companys business in unpredictable waysin 2014 the company completed a comprehensive strategic assessment of its market positions and organizational structures the primary purpose of the strategic assessment is to focus managements expertise to create an environment where the company will be both unified and confident in allocating its resources in areas that maximize the total returns to its stakeholders the companys strategic assessment has resulted in the following four basic broad key strategic initiativesensure every operating units baseline growth strategies for the air ocean and customs services both defend existing market share and grow at the rate of that units ie district or region relevant market growth rate transcon and distribution services are expected to maintain current growth ratesalign and integrate europeanasian pacific interests and europeannorth americas interest to the same degree asian pacific and americas interests have historically been aligned this alignment is expected to result in additional growth in these markets beyond the baseline growth expectations referenced aboveleverage our long and deeply entrenched presence in various asian export markets and the reputation we have with strategic carriers servicing those markets to create a stronger asian import presence while concentrating and enhancing export capabilities in key strategic lanes particularly into and out of china and southeast asia this is expected to create additional product growth opportunities in these marketsexpand market share growth and position in north america traditionally the companys most strategic market 16international trade and competitionthe company operates in 63 countries in the competitive global logistics industry and company activities are closely tied to the global economy international trade is influenced by many factors including economic and political conditions in the united states and abroad currency exchange rates and laws and policies relating to tariffs trade restrictions foreign investments and taxation periodically governments consider a variety of changes to current tariffs and trade restrictions and accords the company cannot predict which if any of these proposals may be adopted or the effects the adoption of any such proposal will have on the companys business doing business in foreign locations also subjects the company to a variety of risks and considerations not normally encountered by domestic enterprises in addition to being influenced by governmental policies concerning international trade the companys business may also be affected by political developments and changes in government personnel or policies as well as economic turbulence political unrest and security concerns in the nations in which it does business and the future impact that these events may have on international trade and oil prices the global logistics services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future consistent with continuing uncertainty in global economic conditions concerns over volatile fuel costs rising costs in general disruptions in port services political unrest and fluctuating currency exchange rates the companys pricing and terms continue to be pressured by customers carriers and service providers which has resulted in a compression of the companys unitary margins during 2014 we expect these competitive conditions to continuerecent declines in oil prices did not significantly impact buy and sell rates in 2014 however in 2015 customers have begun to seek reductions in rates related to lower oil prices currently there is uncertainty as to how buy rates will be impacted due to a number of factors including that some carriers having hedged fuel costs through 2015 presently most carriers have not incorporated lower fuel costs in their pricing structure because fuel is an integral part of carriers costs and impacts both the companys cargo space buy rates and its sell rates to customers the company would expect its gross revenues and costs to decline should lower fuel prices persist the company would not expect an adverse effect on net revenues resulting from a decline in oil pricesthe company cannot predict what impact ongoing uncertainties in the global economy may have on its operating results freight volumes pricing changes in consumer demand carrier stability and capacity customers abilities to pay or on changes in competitors behaviorcritical accounting estimatesa summary of the companys significant accounting policies can be found in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this reportmanagement believes that the nature of the companys business is such that there are few complex challenges in accounting for operations while judgments and estimates are a necessary component of any system of accounting the companys use of estimates is limited primarily to the following areasaccounts receivable valuationaccrual of costs related to ancillary services the company providesaccrual of insurance liabilities for the portion of the related exposure which the company has selfinsuredaccrual of various tax liabilitiesaccrual of loss contingencies andcalculation of stockbased compensation expensethese estimates other than the accrual of loss contingencies and calculation of stockbased compensation expense are not highly uncertain and have not historically been subject to significant change management believes that the methods utilized in all of these areas are nonaggressive in approach and consistent in application management believes that there are limited if any alternative accounting principles or methods which could be applied to the companys transactions while the use of estimates means that actual future results may be different from those contemplated by the estimates the company believes that alternative principles and methods used for making such estimates would not produce materially different results than those reportedthe outcomes of government investigations legal proceedings and claims brought against the company are subject to significant uncertainty an estimated loss from a contingency such as a government investigation legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated disclosure of a loss contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a significant loss has been incurred in determining whether a loss should be accrued management evaluates several factors including advice from outside legal counsel in order to estimate the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss or range of reasonably possible loss changes in these factors could have a material impact on the companys financial position results of operations and operating cash flows for any particular quarter or year the company is subject to taxation in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions as discussed in note 1f to the consolidated financial statements in this report earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes are provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits accounting for income taxes involves judgment the company believes its tax positions including intercompany transfer pricing policies are reasonable and consistent as a matter of course the company is audited by various taxing authorities and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution could result in the company owing additional taxes the company establishes liabilities when despite its belief that the tax return positions are appropriate and consistent with tax law it concludes that it may not be successful in realizing the tax benefit in evaluating a tax position the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position the companys estimate of any ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely  17outcome of issues that have been raised by the taxing jurisdiction the company believes the estimates and assumptions used to support its evaluation of its tax positions are reasonable however final determinations of tax liabilities could be materially different from estimatesas described in note 1h to the consolidated financial statements in this report the company accounts for stockbased compensation based on an estimate of the fair value of options granted to employees under the companys stock option and stock purchase rights plans this expense as adjusted for expected forfeitures is recorded on a straightline basis over the vesting perioddetermining the appropriate option pricing model to use to estimate stock compensation expense requires judgment any option pricing model requires assumptions that are subjective and these assumptions also require judgment examples include assumptions about longterm stock price volatility employee exercise patterns prevesting option forfeitures postvesting option terminations and future interest rates and dividend yields the company uses the blackscholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate based upon the companys historical and currently expected future experience looking to future events management has been strongly influenced by historical patterns which may not be valid predictors of future developments and any future deviation may be materialthe companys expected volatility assumptions are based on the historical volatility of the companys stock over a period of time commensurate to the expected life the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee postvesting termination behavior the riskfree interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the corresponding yield curve in effect at the time of grant for us treasury bonds having the same term as the expected life of the option ie a ten year bond rate is used for valuing an option with a ten year expected life the expected dividend yield is based on the companys historical experience the forfeiture assumption used to calculate compensation expense is primarily based on historical prevesting employee forfeiture patternsthe fair value of an option is more significantly impacted by changes in the expected volatility and expected life assumptions the prevesting forfeitures assumption is ultimately adjusted to the actual forfeiture rate therefore changes in the forfeitures assumption would not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period estimated forfeitures are reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstancesresults of operationsthe following table shows the total net revenues a nongaap measure calculated as revenues less directly related operations expenses attributable to the companys principal services and the companys expenses for 2014 2013 and 2012 expressed as percentages of net revenues management believes that net revenues are a better measure than total revenues when analyzing and discussing managements effectiveness in managing the companys principal services since total revenues earned by the company as a freight consolidator include the carriers charges to the company for carrying the shipment whereas revenues earned by the company in its other capacities include primarily the commissions and fees actually earned by the company net revenue is one of the companys primary operational and financial measures that demonstrates the ability of the company to manage sell rates to customers with its ability to concentrate and leverage its purchasing power through effective consolidation of shipments from multiple customers utilizing a variety of transportation carriers and optimal routings using net revenue also provides a commonality for comparison among various services 18the table chart and the accompanying discussion and analysis should

servicesairfreight services revenues increased 6 in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to a 9 increase in tonnage that was partially offset by lower sell rates in response to competitive market conditions in north america and asia pacific airfreight services expenses increased 5 in 2014 as compared with 2013 as the increase in tonnage was slightly offset by negotiating lower buy rates with carriers primarily on exports from north america and asia pacificairfreight services net revenues in 2014 increased 6 as compared with 2013 the increase was principally due to a 9 improvement in airfreight tonnage partially offset by a 3 decrease in net revenue per kilo north america export tonnage grew by 14 while net revenues increased by only 8 as the reduction in average sell rates to customers exceeded the reduction in average buy rates negotiated with carriers europe net revenues increased 17 primarily due to a 23 growth in export tonnage as a result of new customers asia pacific net revenues remained flat the 4 growth in export tonnage in asia pacific was offset by lower average sell rates in response to competitive market conditions which resulted in a 4 reduction in net revenue per kilothe company expects the global airfreight market to continue to be affected by carrier overcapacity and the timing of new product launches customers remain focused on improving supplychain efficiency reducing overall logistics costs by negotiating lower rates and utilizing ocean freight whenever possible the company expects these trends to continue in conjunction with carriers efforts to manage available capacity however this could be affected by new product launches during periods that have historically experienced higher demands these factors create a higher degree of volatility in volumes and ultimately buy and sell ratesocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight and ocean services revenues increased 11 in 2014 as compared with 2013 due primarily to an 11 increase in container volume in the first half of 2014 the company implemented sell rate reductions to maintain existing customers and grow market share during the second half of 2014 average rates increased due to higher overall demand in the marketplace ocean freight and ocean services expenses increased 13 in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily as the result of the increase in volume and higher costs in ocean freight consolidation container volume is measured in terms of fortyfoot container equivalent units feusocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 6 in 2014 as compared with 2013 ocean freight net revenues are comprised of three basic services ocean freight consolidation direct ocean forwarding and order management the largest component of the companys ocean freight net revenue is derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 45 and 46 of ocean freight net revenue in 2014 and 2013 respectively 20ocean freight consolidation net revenues increased 4 in 2014 as compared with 2013 this increase was due primarily to an 11 growth in container volume largely offset by the effect of reducing sell rates principally in the first half of 2014 this resulted in a 6 decrease in net revenue per kilo primarily in north america and asia pacific direct ocean freight forwarding net revenues increased 6 in 2014 as compared with 2013 as a result of higher volumes principally in north america asia pacific and europe order management net revenues increased 9 in 2014 as compared with 2013 due to additional services and volumes with new and existing customers primarily in north america the overall margins in order management declined due to higher costs primarily in asia pacific north america ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 7 in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in ocean freight consolidation in the second half of the year and growth in order management europe net revenues increased 4 primarily due to an increase in direct ocean forwarding asia pacific net revenues increased 5 due primarily to an increase in both direct ocean forwarding and ocean freight consolidation volumescustoms brokerage and other servicescustoms brokerage and other services revenues and expenses increased 8 and 12 respectively in 2014 as compared with 2013 as a result of increased volumes from existing and new customers and higher costs in import and delivery servicescustoms brokerage and other services net revenues increased 4 in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and

brokers with sophisticated computerized capabilities critical to an overall logistics management program including rapid responses to changes in the regulatory and security environmentnorth america asia pacific and europe net revenues increased 6 1 and 4 in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily as a result of higher volumes from existing and new customersoverhead expensessalaries and related costs increased 3 in 2014 as compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase in the number of employees in north america and europe and higher base salaries in 2014 the company benefited from a reduction in expense resulting from favorable claims experience in its employee healthcare selfinsurance program historically the relatively consistent relationship between salaries and net revenues is the result of a compensation philosophy that has been maintained since the inception of the company offer a modest base salary and the opportunity to share in a fixed and determinable percentage of the operating profit of the business unit controlled by each key employee using this compensation model changes in individual incentive compensation will occur in proportion to changes in company operating income creating a direct alignment between corporate performance and shareholder interests bonuses to executive management in 2014 were down 2 as compared with 2013 primarily as a result of a reduction in the 2014 bonus pool to recoup the retirement bonus expensed in 2013 for peter j rose the companys former chairman and chief executive officer excluding the recovery of the retirement bonus bonuses to executive management increased 7 the companys management incentive compensation programs have always been incentivebased and performance driven and there is no builtin bias that favors or enriches management in a manner inconsistent with overall corporate performance salaries and related costs decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 as compared with 2013 as the growth in net revenues outpaced salary and related cost increases from the increase in the number of employees and higher base salaries because the companys management incentive compensation programs are also cumulative no management bonuses can be paid unless the relevant business unit is from inception cumulatively profitable any operating losses must have been offset in their entirety by operating profits before management is eligible for a bonus executive management in very limited circumstances has made exceptions at the branch operating unit level since the most significant portion of management compensation comes from the incentive bonus programs the company believes that this cumulative feature is a disincentive to excessive risk taking by its managers due to the nature of the companys services it has a short operating cycle the outcome of any higher risk transactions such as overriding established credit limits would be known in a relatively short time frame management believes that when the potential and certain impact on the bonus is fully considered in light of this short operating cycle the potential for short term gains that could be generated by engaging in risky business practices is sufficiently mitigated to discourage excessive and inappropriate risk taking management believes that both the stability and the long term growth in revenues net revenues and net earnings are a result of the incentives inherent in the companys compensation programother overhead expenses increased 8 in 2014 as compared with 2013 the increase in expenses is primarily due to i consulting fees and costs associated with the companys strategic assessment and organizational changes ii higher costs related to investments in software and systems iii increased building maintenance and warehousing costs iv higher travel costs and v higher business taxes partially offset by a recovery of bad debt expense and reduced legal and claims costs other overhead expenses remained constant as a percentage of net revenues in 2014 as compared with 2013income tax expensethe company pays income taxes in the united states and other jurisdictions the companys consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 379 in 2014 as compared with 389 in 2013 the decrease in the effective tax rate is principally the result of an increasingly higher proportion of the companys total outstanding stockbased compensation expense being for nonqualified stock options grants the tax benefit associated with nonqualified stock option grants is recorded when the related compensation expense is recognized while the tax benefit received for incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares cannot be anticipated and are recognized if and when a disqualifying disposition occurs 212013 compared with 2012 airfreight servicesairfreight services revenues and related expenses in 2013 both increased 1 as compared with 2012 a 4 increase in tonnage was offset by lower sell and buy rates that reflected continued soft market conditions primarily caused by higher available capacity relative to demand and effective carrier utilization by the company airfreight services net revenues in 2013 increased 4 as compared with 2012 the increase in airfreight services net revenues was principally due to a 4 increase in airfreight tonnage while net revenue per kilo remained relatively constant north america asia pacific and europe airfreight services net revenues increased 3 4 and 3 respectively in 2013 as compared with 2012 while airfreight export tonnage increased 2 3 and 4 in north america asia pacific and europe respectively ocean freight and ocean servicesocean freight and ocean services revenues and expenses both decreased 1 in 2013 as compared with 2012 primarily driven by lower sell rates to customers and buy rates from carriers reflecting increased carrier capacity that outpaced overall market demand the decreases in sell and buy rates were partially offset by a 6 increase in container volumes in 2013 as compared with 2012ocean freight and ocean services net revenues increased 1 in 2013 as compared with 2012 primarily resulting from additional services and volumes with new and existing customers utilizing order management servicesin 2013 and 2012 the majority of the companys ocean freight net revenue was derived from ocean freight consolidation which represented 46 and 47 respectively of ocean freight net revenue ocean freight consolidation net revenues decreased 1 in 2013 as compared with 2012 primarily due to a 7 decrease in net revenue per container offset by a 6 increase in container volume in 2013 ocean carriers attempted on several occasions throughout the year to increase prices ultimately these efforts were relatively unsuccessful and market ocean rates fell in the face of ongoing capacity issues in order to maintain and grow market share the company reacted to these market trends by temporarily absorbing carrier cost increases when the company anticipated such cost increases would be temporary and could not be sustained by the carriers the company also implemented rate reductions with its customers where needed to reflect market conditions mostly on exports from chinaorder management net revenues increased 6 in 2013 as compared with 2012 due to additional services and volumes with new

the fourth quarter of 2013 the company and mr rose entered into a succession agreement agreement mr rose retired as chief executive officer of the company effective march 1 2014 pursuant to the agreement mr rose receives a retirement bonus equal to the amount he would have received under the 2008 executive incentive compensation plan plan for 2014 and the first five months of 2015 based on the same percentage of the pool under the plan that was used to calculate his incentive compensation for the quarter ended june 30 2013 the company recorded 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 for this retirement bonus as allowed by the plan the compensation committee of the company did not reallocate mr roses current percentage of the available pool to other officers or key employees in 2014 and will not until actual payments made to mr rose under the agreement are complete and an amount equal to the total retirement bonus paid has been recoupedother overhead expenses decreased 4 in 2013

certain foreign indirect withholding taxes and 3 million of expense associated with the writeoff of capitalized real estate projects that the company decided not to continue pursuing the impact of these 2012 items was partially offset by an 8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as a result of investments in technology and building and leasehold improvements and higher costs of claims other overhead expenses decreased 1 as a percentage of net revenues in 2013 as compared with 2012 22income tax expensethe companys consolidated effective income tax rate decreased to 389 in 2013 as compared to 395 in 2012 the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to lower nondeductible expenses as compared to the prior year period and less of a negative impact in the current year period associated with the companys stockbased compensation arrangements when compared to the prior year periodcurrency and other risk factorsthe nature of the companys worldwide operations necessitates the company dealing with a multitude of currencies other than the us dollar this results in the company being exposed to the inherent risks of volatile international currency markets and governmental interference some of the countries where the company maintains offices andor agency relationships have strict currency control regulations which influence the companys ability to hedge foreign currency exposure the company tries to compensate for these exposures by accelerating international currency settlements among its offices or agents the company may enter into foreign currency hedging transactions where there are regulatory or commercial limitations on the companys ability to move money freely around the world or the shortterm financial outlook in any country is such that hedging is the most timesensitive way to mitigate shortterm exchange losses any such hedging activity during 2014 2013 and 2012 was insignificant the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 net foreign currency losses were approximately 4 million 3 million and 9 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyinternational air and ocean freight forwarding and customs brokerage are intensively competitive and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future there are a large number of entities competing in the international logistics industry many of which have significantly more resources than the company however the companys primary competition is confined to a relatively small number of companies within this group the industry continues to experience consolidations into larger firms striving for stronger and more complete multinational and multiservice networks however regional and local brokers and forwarders remain a competitive forcethe primary competitive factors in the international logistics industry continue to be price and quality of service including reliability responsiveness expertise convenience and scope of operations the company emphasizes quality customer service and believes that its prices are competitive with those of others in the industry customers regularly solicit bids from competitors in order to improve service pricing and contractual terms such as seeking longer payment terms higher or unlimited liability limits and performance penalties increased competition and competitors acceptance of expanded contractual terms could result in reduced revenues reduced margins higher operating costs or loss of market share any of which would damage the companys results of operations and financial conditionlarger customers utilize more sophisticated and efficient procedures for the management of their logistics supply chains by embracing strategies such as justintime inventory management the company believes that this trend has resulted in customers using fewer service providers with greater technological capacity and more consistent global coverage accordingly sophisticated computerized customer service capabilities and a stable worldwide network have become significant factors in attracting and retaining customers developing and maintaining these systems and a worldwide network has added a considerable indirect cost to the services provided to customers smaller and middletier competitors in general do not have the resources available to develop customized systems and a worldwide networkliquidity and capital resourcesthe companys principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 was 395 million as compared with 408 million for 2013 this 13 million decrease is primarily due to changes in working capital accounts partially offset by higher earnings at december 31 2014 working capital was 1305 million including cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments of 967 million the company had no debt at december 31 2014 management believes that the companys current cash position and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet its capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future including meeting any contingent liabilities related to standby letters of credit and other obligationsas a customs broker the company makes significant cash advances for a select group of its creditworthy customers these cash advances are for customer obligations such as the payment of duties to customs authorities in various countries throughout the world cash advances are a pass through and are not recorded as a component of revenue and expense the billings of such advances to customers are accounted for as a direct increase in accounts receivable from the customer and a corresponding increase in accounts payable to governmental customs authorities as a result of these pass through billings the conventional days sales outstanding or dso calculation does not directly measure collection efficiency for customers that meet certain criteria the company has agreed to extend payment terms beyond its customary terms management believes that the company has effective credit control procedures and historically has experienced relatively insignificant collection problemsthe companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations cash flow fluctuates as a result of this seasonality historically the first quarter shows an excess of customer collections over customer billings this results in positive cash flow the increased activity associated with peak season typically commencing late second or early third quarter and continuing well into the fourth quarter causes an excess of customer billings over customer collections this cyclical growth in customer receivables consumes available cashcash used by investing activities for the year ended december 31 2014 was 79 million as compared

that are available to be repatriated impact of inflationto date the companys business has not been adversely affected by inflation direct carrier rate increases could occur over the short to mediumterm period due to the high degree of competition in the market place these rate increases can lead to an erosion in the companys margins as the company is not required to purchase or maintain

7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskthe company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of its business these risks are primarily related to foreign exchange risk and changes in shortterm interest rates the potential impact of the companys exposure to these risks is presented belowforeign exchange riskthe company conducts business in many different countries and currencies the companys business often results in revenue billings issued in a country and currency which differs from that where the expenses related to the service are incurred in the ordinary course of business the company creates numerous intercompany transactions and may have receivables payables and currencies that are not denominated in the local functional currency this brings foreign exchange risk to the companys earnings the principal foreign exchange risks to which the company is exposed are in chinese yuan euro mexican peso canadian dollar and british poundforeign exchange rate sensitivity analysis can be quantified by estimating the impact on the companys earnings as a result of hypothetical changes in the value of the us dollar the companys functional currency relative to the other currencies in which the company transacts business all other things being equal an average 10 weakening of the us dollar throughout the year ended december 31 2014 would have had the effect of raising operating income approximately 42 million an average 10 strengthening of the us dollar for the same period would have the effect of reducing operating income approximately 35 million this analysis does not take into account changes in shipping patterns based upon this hypothetical currency fluctuation for example a weakening in the us dollar would be expected to increase exports from the united states and decrease imports into the united states over some relevant period of time but the exact effect of this change cannot be quantified without making speculative assumptionsthe company currently does not use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency risk and only enters into foreign currency hedging transactions in limited locations where regulatory or commercial limitations restrict the companys ability to move money freely any such hedging activity throughout the year ended december 31 2014 was insignificant net foreign currency losses were approximately 4 million 3 million and 9 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the company had no foreign currency derivatives outstanding at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company instead follows

the company performed the required goodwill annual impairment test during the fourth quarter and determined that no impairment had occurrede  revenues and revenue recognitionthe company derives its revenues from three principal sources 1 airfreight services 2 ocean freight and ocean services and 3 customs brokerage and other services these are the revenue categories presented in the financial statementsas a nonasset based carrier the company does not own transportation assets rather the company generates the major portion of its air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct assetbased carriers and reselling those services to its customers the difference between the rate billed to customers the sell rate and the rate paid to the carrier the buy rate is termed net revenue a nongaap measure yield or margin by consolidating shipments from multiple customers and concentrating its buying power the company is able to negotiate favorable buy rates from the direct carriers while at the same time offering lower sell rates than customers would otherwise be able to negotiate themselvesairfreight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a freight consolidator ocean freight services revenues include the charges to the company for carrying the shipments when the company acts as a nonvessel operating common carrier nvocc in each case the company is acting as an indirect carrier when acting f9as an indirect carrier the company will issue a house airway bill hawb or a house ocean bill of lading hobl to customers as the contract of carriage in turn when the freight is physically tendered to a direct carrier the company receives a contract of carriage known as a master airway bill for airfreight shipments and a master ocean bill of lading for ocean shipments at this point the risk of loss passes to the carrier however in order to claim for any such loss the customer is first obligated to pay the freight charges in these transactions the company is the primary obligor is obligated to compensate direct carriers for services performed regardless of whether customers accept the service has latitude in establishing price has discretion in selecting the direct carrier and has credit risk therefore the company is the principal in these transactions and reports revenue and the related expenses on a gross basis based upon the terms in the contract of carriage revenues related to shipments where the company issues a hawb or a hobl are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same timerevenues realized in other capacities for instance when the company acts as an agent for the shipper and does not issue a hawb or a hobl include only the commissions and fees earned for the services performed in these transactions the company is not a principal and reports only commissions and fees earned in revenue these revenues are recognized upon completion of the servicescustoms brokerage and other services involves providing services at destination such as helping customers clear shipments through customs by preparing required documentation calculating and providing for payment of duties and other taxes on behalf of the customers as well as arranging for any required inspections by governmental agencies and arranging for delivery this is a complicated function requiring technical knowledge of customs rules and regulations in the multitude of countries in which the company has offices revenues related to customs brokerage and other services are recognized upon completion of the services arranging international shipments is a complex task each actual movement can require multiple services in some instances the company is asked to perform only one of these services however in most instances the company performs multiple services these services include ancillary services such as local transportation export customs formalities distribution services and logistics management each of these services has an associated fee which is recognized as revenue upon completion of the servicetypically the fees for each of these services are quoted as separate components however customers on occasion will request an allinclusive rate for a set of services known in the industry as doortodoor service this means that the customer is billed a single rate for all services from pickup at origin to delivery at destination in these instances the revenue for origin and destination services as well as revenue that will be characterized as freight charges is allocated to branches as set by preexisting company policy modified as agreed upon by customer specific negotiations between the offices involved each of the companys branches are separate profit centers and the primary compensation for the branch management group comes in the form of incentivebased compensation calculated directly from the operating income of that branch this compensation structure ensures that the allocation of revenue and expense among components of services when provided under an allinclusive rate is done in an objective manner on a relative selling price basisthe company presents revenues net of sales and valueadded taxesf  income taxesincome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method of accounting under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributed to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases the tax effect of loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date earnings of the companys foreign subsidiaries are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states and accordingly us federal and state income taxes have been provided for all undistributed earnings net of related foreign tax credits a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized the company recognizes interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits or underpayment of
