  we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes  interest rate risk  our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps  we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 300 million senior note debt issuance in november 2012 the fixed rates of the hedges were 207 and 192 and were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on november 1 2012 and resulted in a loss of 51 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4480 billion as of august 30 2014 and 4259 billion as of august 31 2013 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1366 million and 722 million at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 respectively we had 8938 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2014 and 6370 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2013 in fiscal 2014 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 89 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3450 billion at august 30 2014 and 3550 billion at august 31 2013 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1561 million at august 30 2014    34    table of contents fuel price risk  from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012  foreign currency risk  foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material  we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 4392 million at august 30 2014 and 3787 million at august 31 2013 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 19 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2014 and decreased by approximately 11 during fiscal 2013 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 would be approximately 399 million and approximately 344 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations    35    table of contents
