  our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business  if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected  demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including           the number of vehicles in current service including those that are seven years old and older these vehicles are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles           rising energy prices increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs           the economy in periods of declining economic conditions both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit during periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles           the weather mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts           technological advances advances in automotive technology and parts design could result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  for the long term demand for our products may be affected by           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation  all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets  competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more    11    table of contents  frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4240 stores at august 30 2008 to 5201 stores at august 31 2013 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6523 billion in fiscal 2008 to 9148 billion in fiscal 2013 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in samestore sales  if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited  although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited  significant changes in macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings  moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt  macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has stagnated and unemployment has remained at historically high levels during the past five years if the united states government is unable to reach agreement on legislation addressing the united states current debt level and budget deficit many economists have predicted another economic recession continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of    12    table of contents  our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations  our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees  we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 71000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata and autoanything we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates  inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales  our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network  our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably  in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins  our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name  we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation    13    table of contents our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and autozoners failure to protect the security of our customers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer while we take significant steps to protect customer employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards our security measures may be breached in the future due to cyber attack employee error or other acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data to date we have not experienced any significant breaches of information  damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation  business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business  war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected  in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers  we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations
