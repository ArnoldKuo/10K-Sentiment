  we are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 31 2013 operated 4836 stores in the united states including puerto rico 362 in mexico and three in brazil each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 31 2013 in 3421 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that

hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services  executive summary  we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013 delivering record net income of 1016 billion a 93 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 5437 million a 63 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment over the past several years various factors have occurred within the economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recession continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions although we have seen a recent increase in new vehicle sales we believe our consumers cash flows continue to decrease due to the previously listed factors given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future  we believe other macroeconomic factors have adversely affected both our customers and our industry during fiscal 2013 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states remained at a high level 365 per gallon compared to 357 per gallon during fiscal 2012 we continue to believe gas prices will remain at overall high levels thereby reducing discretionary spending for all consumers and in particular our customers with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods  an additional macroeconomic factor facing our customer is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic levels the reduction in our customers take home pay as a result of the recent increase in payroll taxes was effective at the beginning of the 2013 calendar year and at this point we cannot predict the impact this change has had or will have on our sales in future periods  during fiscal 2013 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while    19    table of contents  we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category as a percentage of sales we believe the slowdown in maintenance related products during fiscal 2013 was largely due to weather related impacts in various regions because of the unusually mild winter during fiscal 2012 across parts of the us we saw a reduced benefit from sales of maintenance related products in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year however sales in the maintenance category did improve in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 due to a more normalized winter in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment specifically during fiscal 2013 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment as a result we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores and increasing product availability in our stores we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment  the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road  miles driven  we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2013 latest publicly available information miles driven decreased slightly compared to the same period last year  seven year old or older vehicles  since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association as of january 1 2013 the average age of vehicles on the road is 113 years as compared to 111 years as of january 1 2012 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell  results of operations  fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012  for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we reported net sales of 9148 billion compared with 8604 billion for the year ended august 25 2012 a 63 increase from fiscal 2012 this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of 2223 million the 53rd week sales of 1777 million and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year  at august 31 2013 we operated 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil compared with 4685 domestic stores 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25 2012 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 52 for fiscal 2013  gross profit for fiscal 2013 was 4741 billion or 518 of net sales compared with 4432 billion or 515 of net sales for fiscal 2012 the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything 28 basis points    20    table of contents operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to 2968 billion or 324 of net sales from 2803 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to lower incentive compensation 19 basis points partially offset by lower sales growth rates  interest expense net for fiscal 2013 was 1854 million compared with 1759 million during fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were 3927 billion compared with 3507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 45 for fiscal 2013 compared to 47 for fiscal 2012  our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 360 for fiscal 2012  net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 93 to 1016 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 183 to 2779 from 2348 in fiscal 2012 the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately 109  effective december 2012 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to 150 million including an initial cash payment of 115 million up to a 5 million holdback payment for working capital trueups and contingent payments not to exceed 30 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we paid the holdback payment for working capital trueups of 11 million with this acquisition we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of 834 million and intangible assets totaling 587 million goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was 227 million  we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything based on an analysis of autoanythings revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired accordingly we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanythings trade name as compared to its carrying value it was determined that autoanythings trade name was also impaired we recorded an impairment charge of 41 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name  based on the revised plan financial results we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31 2013 to 02 million resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of 233 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of 09 million the net impact is included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in our other business activities  fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011  for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 we reported net sales of 8604 billion compared with 8073 billion for the year ended august 27 2011 a 66 increase from fiscal 2011 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 39 and sales from new stores of 2142 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value partially offset by decreased transaction counts  at august 25 2012 we operated 4685 domestic stores and 321 stores in mexico compared with 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico at august 27 2011 we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of 65 for fiscal 2012    21    table of contents gross profit for fiscal 2012 was 4432 billion or 515 of net sales compared with 4119 billion or 510 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins 19 basis points and lower shrink expense 17 basis points lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the year  operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased to 2803 billion or 326 of net sales from 2625 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher selfinsurance costs 42 basis points partially offset by lower incentive compensation 30 basis points  interest expense net for fiscal 2012 was 1759 million compared with 1706 million during fiscal 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2012 were 3507 billion compared with 3103 billion for fiscal 2011 and weighted average borrowing rates were 47 for fiscal 2012 compared to 51 for fiscal 2011  our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2012 compared to 359 for fiscal 2011  net income for fiscal 2012 increased by 96 to 9304 million and diluted earnings per share increased 206 to 2348 from 1947 in fiscal 2011 the impact of the fiscal 2012 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 was an increase of approximately 096  seasonality and quarterly periods  our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil  each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 and 2011 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 represented 327 of annual sales and 355 of net income  liquidity and capital resources  the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 and 1292 billion in fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables and the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1156 at august 31 2013 1114 at august 25 2012 and 1117 at august 27 2011 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores during fiscal 2013 we initiated a variety of strategic inventory tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per store many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio  our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2011 to august 31 2013 we have opened 578 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 5273 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 3748 million in fiscal 2012 and 3190 million in    22    table of contents  fiscal 2011 we invested 4145 million in capital assets in fiscal 2013 compared to 3781 million in fiscal 2012 and 3216 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 197 for fiscal 2013 193 for fiscal 2012 and 188 for fiscal 2011 cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 there were no acquisitions in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 445 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2013 457 million in fiscal 2012 and 438 million in fiscal 2011 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 379 million in fiscal 2013 424 million in fiscal 2012 and 431 million in fiscal 2011 capital asset disposals provided proceeds of 98 million in fiscal 2013 66 million in fiscal 2012 and 33 million in fiscal 2011  net cash used in financing activities was 8470 million in fiscal 2013 8434 million in fiscal 2012 and 9738 million in fiscal 2011 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 and 1467 billion for fiscal 2011 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 800 million for fiscal 2013 500 million for fiscal 2012 and 500 million for fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2011 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our 1993 million senior notes due in november 2010 to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2013 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1187 million in 2012 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million in 2011 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowing in the amount of 1415 million  during fiscal 2014 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2013 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10 18 and 2 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 30 2014  in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate  depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past  our cash balances are held in various locations around the world of the 1422 million and 1031 million of cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively 382 million and 78 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations    23    table of contents for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our aftertax return on invested capital roic was 327 as compared to 330 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the acquisition of autoanything we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance  debt facilities  in september 2011 we amended and restated our 800 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in july 2012 the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to 10 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 1250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2016  the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 31 2013 was 4681  as of august 31 2013 637 million of commercial paper borrowings and 3263 million of the 6500 senior notes due january 2014 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 31 2013 we had 9633 million of availability under our 10 billion revolving credit facility expiring in september 2016 that would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing  in addition to the revolving credit facility we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 31 2013 we have 994 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016  in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 418 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2013 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis  on april 29 2013 we issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the shelf registration the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013  on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes    24    table of contents on april 24 2012 we issued 500 million in 3700 senior notes due april 2022 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 24 2012 were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes on november 15 2010 we issued 500 million in 4000 senior notes due 2020 under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 we used the proceeds from the november 15 2010 issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 4750 senior notes that matured on november 15 2010 to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes  the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 6500 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded the notes along with the 3125 senior notes issued in april 2013 the 2875 senior notes issued in november 2012 the 3700 senior notes issued in april 2012 and the 4000 senior notes issued in during november 2010 also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs  as of august 31 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future  for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense ebitdar ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels  stock repurchases  during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the board on june 11 2013 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1265 billion to 1340 billion from january 1998 to august

a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets  as of august 31 2013 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 2568 million and our pension assets are valued at 2081 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 487 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 836 million at august 31 2013 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains  additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 354 million at august 31 2013 approximately 22 million is classified as current liabilities and 332 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions

of 53 weeks  recent accounting pronouncements  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements  critical accounting policies and estimates  preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management  inventory reserves and cost of sales  lifo  we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout lifo method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out fifo method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2837 million at august 31 2013 calculated using the dollar value method    29    table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on managements judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods  historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns  additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate  each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use  a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 31 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2013  vendor allowances  we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold  based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 500 thousand in each of the last three years  goodwill and intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceeds the current fair value we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss  indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset    30    table of contents  exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates  the carrying value of goodwill at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 was 3678 million and 3026 million respectively during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanythings trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 no indefinitelived intangible amounts were recorded at august 25 2012 we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2013 or in previous fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles  selfinsurance reserves  we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1902 million at august 31 2013 and 1758 million at august 25 2012 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate  the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly  management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 12 million for fiscal 2013  our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 2 million for fiscal 2013 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks  income taxes  our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the    31    table of contents  contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 31 2013 we had approximately 354 million reserved for uncertain tax positions  we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement  we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected  pension obligation  prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 31 2013 our plan assets totaled 208 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 1 million for the qualified plan  discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2013 we assumed a discount rate of 52 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 31 2013 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 2 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan    32    table of contents
