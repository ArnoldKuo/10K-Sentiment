grant date employee options generally vest in equal annual installments on the first second third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and generally have 30 or 90 days after the service relationship ends or one year after death to exercise all vested options the fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straightline basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date  in addition to the 2011 plan on december 15 2010 the company adopted the 2011 director compensation program the 2011 program which states that nonemployee directors will receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 plan under the 2011 program restricted stock units are granted the first day of each calendar quarter the number of restricted stock units granted each quarter is determined by dividing onefourth of the amount of the annual retainer by the

subsequent to the nonemployee director ceasing to be a member of the board  the 2011 program replaced the 2003 comp plan and the 2003 option plan under the 2003 comp plan nonemployee directors could

2003 option plan  the company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the blackscholesmerton multipleoption pricing valuation model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense the following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related sharebased compensation expense                        year ended        august 312013     august 252012     august

options granted  expected price volatility  this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility the company calculates daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense  riskfree interest rate  this is the us treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense  expected lives  this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense  forfeiture rate  this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested this estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense this estimate is evaluated periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate  dividend yield  the company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense  the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was 9858 during fiscal 2013 9471 during fiscal 2012 and 5857 during fiscal 2011 the intrinsic value of options exercised was 1946 million in fiscal 2013 1765 million in fiscal 2012 and 1000 million in fiscal 2011 the total fair value of

company has adopted asc topic 820 fair value measurement which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements this standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value and although it does not require additional fair value measurements it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels  level 1 inputs  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access an active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information  level 2 inputs  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability level 2 inputs include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities credit risk and default rates  level 3 inputs  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability    53    table of

continued employment by the selling stockholders based on specific operating income targets for each year the sellers can receive up to 10 million in the first year and up to 30 million in the second year with contingent consideration not exceeding 30 million in the aggregate the estimated fair value of the performancebased contingent consideration of 227 million was included as part of the purchase price allocation at the time of acquisition the company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration based on a probabilityweighted discounted cash flow analysis the fair value remeasurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a level 3 measurement as defined in the fair value hierarchy in each period the company reassesses its current estimates of performance relative to the stated targets and adjusts the liability to fair value  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the company determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore the contingent consideration was adjusted to reflect the fair value at august 31 2013 of 02 million
