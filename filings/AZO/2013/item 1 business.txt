stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are

dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts  store operations  store formats  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items  we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking  store personnel and training  each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management  store managers sales representatives commercial specialists and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners  all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales  store automation  all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen  our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores    7    table of contents store development  the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years                                fiscal year        2013     2012     2011

               we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions   purchasing and supply chain  merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2013 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales no vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases and we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms  our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week  competition  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas including name recognition product availability customer service store
