tailor our inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire

range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts  store operations  store formats  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items  we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking  store personnel and training  each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product issues standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management  store managers sales representatives commercial specialists and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners  all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales  store automation  all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen  our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures in addition our wide area network enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes to access national warranty data to implement realtime inventory controls and to locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores    7    table of contents store development  the following table reflects our store development during the past five

well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions   purchasing and supply chain  merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee and monterrey mexico in fiscal 2013 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales no vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases and we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms  our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store generally has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week  competition  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in

certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business  if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected  demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors including           the number of vehicles in current service including those that are seven years old and older these vehicles are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles           rising energy prices increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs           the economy in periods of declining economic conditions both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit during periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles           the weather mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts           technological advances advances in automotive technology and parts design could result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  for the long term demand for our products may be affected by           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation  all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and is based on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets  competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more    11    table of contents  frequent customer visits and more effective advertising if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4240 stores at august 30 2008 to 5201 stores at august 31 2013 an average store count increase per year of 5 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6523 billion in fiscal 2008 to 9148 billion in fiscal 2013 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and increases in samestore sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by continued job losses wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by continued recessionary pressures we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in samestore sales  if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited  although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market to increase commercial sales we must compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers and auto dealers although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited  significant changes in macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings  moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt  macroeconomic conditions also impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has stagnated and unemployment has remained at historically high levels during the past five years if the united states government is unable to reach agreement on legislation addressing the united states current debt level and budget deficit many economists have predicted another economic recession continued recessionary conditions could result in additional job losses and business failures which could result in our loss of certain small business customers and curtailment of spending by our retail customers in addition continued distress in global credit markets business failures and other recessionary conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of    12    table of contents  our suppliers to obtain necessary short and longterm financing to meet our inventory demands moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs all of these macroeconomic conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations  our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees  we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 71000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata and autoanything we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates  inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales  our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network  our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably  in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains we could experience inappropriate inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins  our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name  we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise failure to comply with ethical social product labor and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation    13    table of contents our business involves the storage of personal information about our customers and autozoners failure to protect the security of our customers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer while we take significant steps to protect customer employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards our security measures may be breached in the future due to cyber attack employee error or other acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data to date we have not experienced any significant breaches of information  damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation  business interruptions may negatively impact our store hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business  war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected  in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers  we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches and catastrophic events if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could

contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we are also investigating and will be addressing potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the new jersey department of environmental protection asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 directive that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory and we have contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are also named in the directive in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we are eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification

week it closes and excluded from the computation for all periods subsequent to closing in addition beginning in fiscal 2013 it also includes all sales through our autozone branded websites including consumer direct shiptohome sales all prior period same store sales have been restated to be comparable the effect of including sales from autozone branded websites was not material to any period    3

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 31 2013 operated 4836 stores in the united states including puerto rico 362 in mexico and three in brazil each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 31 2013 in 3421 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico as well as in our stores in brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services  executive summary  we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2013 delivering record net income of 1016 billion a 93 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 5437 million a 63 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and continue to refine our parts assortment over the past several years various factors have occurred within the economy that affect both our customers and our industry including the impact of the recession continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions although we have seen a recent increase in new vehicle sales we believe our consumers cash flows continue to decrease due to the previously listed factors given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future  we believe other macroeconomic factors have adversely affected both our customers and our industry during fiscal 2013 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states remained at a high level 365 per gallon compared to 357 per gallon during fiscal 2012 we continue to believe gas prices will remain at overall high levels thereby reducing discretionary spending for all consumers and in particular our customers with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumed each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods  an additional macroeconomic factor facing our customer is the reinstitution of payroll taxes back to historic levels the reduction in our customers take home pay as a result of the recent increase in payroll taxes was effective at the beginning of the 2013 calendar year and at this point we cannot predict the impact this change has had or will have on our sales in future periods  during fiscal 2013 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while    19    table of contents  we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight decline in sales of the maintenance category as a percentage of sales we believe the slowdown in maintenance related products during fiscal 2013 was largely due to weather related impacts in various regions because of the unusually mild winter during fiscal 2012 across parts of the us we saw a reduced benefit from sales of maintenance related products in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior fiscal year however sales in the maintenance category did improve in the last quarter of fiscal 2013 due to a more normalized winter in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment specifically during fiscal 2013 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment as a result we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores and increasing product availability in our stores we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macroeconomic environment  the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road  miles driven  we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2013 latest publicly available information miles driven decreased slightly compared to the same period last year  seven year old or older vehicles  since 2008 new vehicle sales have been significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the automotive aftermarket industry association as of january 1 2013 the average age of vehicles on the road is 113 years as compared to 111 years as of january 1 2012 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell  results of operations  fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012  for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we reported net sales of 9148 billion compared with 8604 billion for the year ended august 25 2012 a 63 increase from fiscal 2012 this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of 2223 million the 53rd week sales of 1777 million and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year  at august 31 2013 we operated 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil compared with 4685 domestic stores 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25 2012 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 52 for fiscal 2013  gross profit for fiscal 2013 was 4741 billion or 518 of net sales compared with 4432 billion or 515 of net sales for fiscal 2012 the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything 28 basis points    20    table of contents operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to 2968 billion or 324 of net sales from 2803 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to lower incentive compensation 19 basis points partially offset by lower sales growth rates  interest expense net for fiscal 2013 was 1854 million compared with 1759 million during fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were 3927 billion compared with 3507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 45 for fiscal 2013 compared to 47 for fiscal 2012  our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 360 for fiscal 2012  net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 93 to 1016 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 183 to 2779 from 2348 in fiscal 2012 the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately 109  effective december 2012 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything an online retailer of specialized automotive products for up to 150 million including an initial cash payment of 115 million up to a 5 million holdback payment for working capital trueups and contingent payments not to exceed 30 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we paid the holdback payment for working capital trueups of 11 million with this acquisition we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of 834 million and intangible assets totaling 587 million goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was 227 million  we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything based on an analysis of autoanythings revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired accordingly we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanythings trade name as compared to its carrying value it was determined that autoanythings trade name was also impaired we recorded an impairment charge of 41 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name  based on the revised plan financial results we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31 2013 to 02 million resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of 233 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of 09 million the net impact is included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in our other business activities  fiscal 2012 compared with fiscal 2011  for the fiscal year ended august 25 2012 we reported net sales of 8604 billion compared with 8073 billion for the year ended august 27 2011 a 66 increase from fiscal 2011 this growth was driven primarily by an increase in domestic same store sales of 39 and sales from new stores of 2142 million the improvement in domestic same store sales was driven by higher transaction value partially offset by decreased transaction counts  at august 25 2012 we operated 4685 domestic stores and 321 stores in mexico compared with 4534 domestic stores and 279 stores in mexico at august 27 2011 we reported a total auto parts domestic and mexico operations sales increase of 65 for fiscal 2012    21    table of contents gross profit for fiscal 2012 was 4432 billion or 515 of net sales compared with 4119 billion or 510 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the improvement in gross margin was primarily attributable to higher merchandise margins 19 basis points and lower shrink expense 17 basis points lower acquisition costs drove the higher merchandise margins for the year  operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2012 increased to 2803 billion or 326 of net sales from 2625 billion or 325 of net sales for fiscal 2011 the slight increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was the result of higher selfinsurance costs 42 basis points partially offset by lower incentive compensation 30 basis points  interest expense net for fiscal 2012 was 1759 million compared with 1706 million during fiscal 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2012 were 3507 billion compared with 3103 billion for fiscal 2011 and weighted average borrowing rates were 47 for fiscal 2012 compared to 51 for fiscal 2011  our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2012 compared to 359 for fiscal 2011  net income for fiscal 2012 increased by 96 to 9304 million and diluted earnings per share increased 206 to 2348 from 1947 in fiscal 2011 the impact of the fiscal 2012 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2012 was an increase of approximately 096  seasonality and quarterly periods  our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil  each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 and 2011 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 represented 327 of annual sales and 355 of net income  liquidity and capital resources  the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 and 1292 billion in fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables and the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1156 at august 31 2013 1114 at august 25 2012 and 1117 at august 27 2011 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores during fiscal 2013 we initiated a variety of strategic inventory tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per store many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio  our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2011 to august 31 2013 we have opened 578 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 5273 million in fiscal 2013 compared to 3748 million in fiscal 2012 and 3190 million in    22    table of contents  fiscal 2011 we invested 4145 million in capital assets in fiscal 2013 compared to 3781 million in fiscal 2012 and 3216 million in fiscal 2011 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 197 for fiscal 2013 193 for fiscal 2012 and 188 for fiscal 2011 cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 there were no acquisitions in fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 445 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2013 457 million in fiscal 2012 and 438 million in fiscal 2011 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 379 million in fiscal 2013 424 million in fiscal 2012 and 431 million in fiscal 2011 capital asset disposals provided proceeds of 98 million in fiscal 2013 66 million in fiscal 2012 and 33 million in fiscal 2011  net cash used in financing activities was 8470 million in fiscal 2013 8434 million in fiscal 2012 and 9738 million in fiscal 2011 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 and 1467 billion for fiscal 2011 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 800 million for fiscal 2013 500 million for fiscal 2012 and 500 million for fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2011 we used the proceeds from the issuance of debt to repay our 1993 million senior notes due in november 2010 to repay a portion of our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes in 2013 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1187 million in 2012 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million in 2011 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowing in the amount of 1415 million  during fiscal 2014 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2013 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program and enhancements to existing stores and infrastructure the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10 18 and 2 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 30 2014  in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate  depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past  our cash balances are held in various locations around the world of the 1422 million and 1031 million of cash and cash equivalents at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively 382 million and 78 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations    23    table of contents for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our aftertax return on invested capital roic was 327 as compared to 330 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the acquisition of autoanything we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance  debt facilities  in september 2011 we amended and restated our 800 million revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in july 2012 the capacity under the revolving credit facility was increased to 10 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 1250 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2016  the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 31 2013 was 4681  as of august 31 2013 637 million of commercial paper borrowings and 3263 million of the 6500 senior notes due january 2014 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 31 2013 we had 9633 million of availability under our 10 billion revolving credit facility expiring in september 2016 that would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing  in addition to the revolving credit facility we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 31 2013 we have 994 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016  in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 418 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 31 2013 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis  on april 29 2013 we issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the shelf registration the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013  on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes    24    table of contents on april 24 2012 we issued 500 million in 3700 senior notes due april 2022 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 24 2012 were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes on november 15 2010 we issued 500 million in 4000 senior notes due 2020 under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission on july 29 2008 we used the proceeds from the november 15 2010 issuance of debt to repay the principal due relating to the 4750 senior notes that matured on november 15 2010 to repay a portion of the commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes  the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 6500 and 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded the notes along with the 3125 senior notes issued in april 2013 the 2875 senior notes issued in november 2012 the 3700 senior notes issued in april 2012 and the 4000 senior notes issued in during november 2010 also contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs  as of august 31 2013 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future  for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense ebitdar ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels  stock repurchases  during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed

we have pension obligations reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that are not reflected in the table above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2013 we made contributions of 169 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of approximately 4 million during fiscal 2014 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates or a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets  as of august 31 2013 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 2568 million and our pension assets are valued at 2081 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 487 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 836 million at august 31

our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 354 million at august 31 2013 approximately 22 million is classified as current liabilities and 332 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts

   1 the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 consisted of 53 weeks  recent accounting pronouncements  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements  critical accounting policies and estimates  preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management  inventory reserves and cost of sales  lifo  we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout lifo method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out fifo method for mexico inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 2837 million at august 31 2013 calculated using the dollar value method    29    table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 20 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on managements judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods  historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns  additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate  each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use  a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 31 2013 would have affected net income by approximately 6 million in fiscal 2013  vendor allowances  we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold  based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 500 thousand in each of the last three years  goodwill and intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceeds the current fair value we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss  indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset    30    table of contents  exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates  the carrying value of goodwill at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 was 3678 million and 3026 million respectively during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanythings trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 no indefinitelived intangible amounts were recorded at august 25 2012 we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2013 or in previous fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles  selfinsurance reserves  we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1902 million at august 31 2013 and 1758 million at august 25 2012 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate  the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly  management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our selfinsurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 12 million for fiscal 2013  our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 2 million for fiscal 2013 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks  income taxes  our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the    31    table of contents  contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 31 2013 we had approximately 354 million reserved for uncertain tax positions  we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement  we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected  pension obligation  prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets at august 31 2013 our plan assets totaled 208 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 1 million for the qualified plan  discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2013 we assumed a discount rate of 52 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 31 2013 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 2 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan    32    table of contents item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes  interest rate risk  our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps  we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 300 million senior note debt issuance in november 2012 the fixed rates of the hedges were 207 and 192 and were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on november 1 2012 and resulted in a loss of 51 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4259 billion as of august 31 2013 and 4055 billion as of august 25 2012 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 722 million and 2866 million at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively we had 6370 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2013 and 5182 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 25 2012 in fiscal 2013 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 6 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3550 billion at august 31 2013 and 3250 billion at august 25 2012 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1284 million at august 31 2013  fuel price risk  from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel    33    table of contents  exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 or fiscal 2011  foreign currency risk  foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material  we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3787 million at august 31 2013 and 3157 million at august 25 2012 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 11 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2013 and decreased by approximately 62 during fiscal 2012 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 amounted to approximately 34 million and approximately 29 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations    34    table of contents item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  index             managements report on

recognized over a weighted average period of 25 years tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost are classified as a financing cash inflow  on december 15 2010 the companys stockholders approved the 2011 equity incentive award plan the 2011 plan allowing the company to provide equitybased compensation to nonemployee directors and employees for their service to autozone or its subsidiaries or affiliates under the 2011 plan participants may receive equitybased compensation in the form of stock options stock appreciation rights restricted stock restricted stock units dividend equivalents deferred stock stock payments performance share awards and other incentive awards structured by the board and the compensation committee of the board prior to the companys adoption of the 2011 plan equitybased compensation was provided to employees under the 2006 stock option plan and to nonemployee directors under the 2003 director compensation plan the 2003 comp plan and the 2003 director stock option plan the 2003 option plan  the company grants options to purchase common stock to certain of its employees under its plan at prices equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant options have a term of 10 years or 10 years and one day from grant date employee options generally vest in equal annual installments on the first second third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and generally have 30 or 90 days after the service relationship ends or one year after death to exercise all vested options the fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straightline basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date  in addition to the 2011 plan on december 15 2010 the company adopted the 2011 director compensation program the 2011 program which states that nonemployee directors will receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 plan under the 2011 program restricted stock units are granted the first day of each calendar quarter the number of restricted stock units granted each quarter is determined by dividing onefourth of the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as of the grant date the restricted stock units are fully vested on the date they are issued and are paid in shares of the companys common stock subsequent to the nonemployee director ceasing to be a member of the board  the 2011 program replaced the 2003 comp plan and the 2003 option plan under the 2003 comp plan nonemployee directors could receive no more than onehalf of their director fees immediately in cash and the remainder of the fees was required to be taken in common stock or stock appreciation rights the director had the option to elect to receive up to 100 of the fees in stock or defer all or part of the fees in units with value equivalent to the value of shares of common stock as of the grant date at august 31 2013 the company has 76 million accrued related to 17990 outstanding units issued under the 2003 comp plan and prior plans and there was 67 million accrued related to 18241 outstanding units issued as of august 25 2012 no additional shares of stock or units will be issued in future years under the 2003 comp plan    48    table of contents under the 2003 option plan each nonemployee director received an option grant on january 1 of each year and each new nonemployee director received an option to purchase 3000 shares upon election to the board plus a portion of the annual directors option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually served these stock option grants were made at the fair market value as of the grant date and generally vested three years from the grant date there were 51000 and 104679 outstanding options under the 2003 option plan as of august 31 2013 and august 25 2012 respectively no additional shares of stock or units will be issued in future years under the 2003 option plan  the company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the blackscholesmerton multipleoption pricing valuation model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense the following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related sharebased compensation expense

the assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted  expected price volatility  this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility the company calculates daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense  riskfree interest rate  this is the us treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense  expected lives  this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense  forfeiture rate  this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested this estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense this estimate is evaluated periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate  dividend yield  the company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense  the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was 9858 during fiscal 2013 9471 during fiscal 2012 and 5857 during fiscal 2011 the intrinsic value of options exercised was 1946 million in fiscal 2013 1765

measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements this standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value and although it does not require additional fair value measurements it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels  level 1 inputs  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access an active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information  level 2 inputs  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability level 2 inputs include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities credit risk and default rates

results of operations from autoanything have been included in the companys other business activities since the date of acquisition pro forma results of operations related to the acquisition of autoanything are not presented as autoanythings results are not material to the companys results of operations the purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of 834 million and intangible assets totaling 587 million goodwill generated from the acquisition is tax deductible and is primarily attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was 227 million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the company determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore the contingent consideration was adjusted to reflect the fair value at august 31 2013 of 02 million resulting in a decrease in the contingent consideration liability

was impaired accordingly the company performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company uses the discounted cash flow methodology to determine fair value as it is considered to be the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the business because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013    64    table of contents the carrying amounts of intangible assets which all
