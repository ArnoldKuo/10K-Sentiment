satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics our hub stores carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire  pricing  we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products a key differentiating

domestic store program we offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts  store operations  store formats  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items  we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking  store personnel and training  each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management  store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners  all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico and sao paulo brazil we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales  store automation  all of our stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen  our stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures    7    table of contents store development  the following table reflects our store development during the past five fiscal years                                fiscal year

                                               we believe that expansion opportunities exist in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new store are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions   purchasing and supply chain  merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil in fiscal 2014 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied more than 10 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms  our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple

risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business  if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected  demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including           the number and age of vehicles in current service vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles           rising energy prices increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs and may drive their vehicles less resulting in less wear and tear and lower demand for repairs and maintenance           the economy in periods of declining economic conditions both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repairs additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit during periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles           the weather mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts           technological advances advances in automotive technology and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  for the long term demand for our products may be affected by           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation which may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs  all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing stores autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets  our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts

store layout    11    table of contents  location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  we have increased our store count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4417 stores at august 29 2009 to 5391 stores at august 30 2014 an average store count increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 6817 billion in fiscal 2009 to 9475 billion in fiscal 2014 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new stores and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new stores only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open stores at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales  consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business  recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business  if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited  although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket jobbers have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited  a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities  our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings    12    table of contents moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in calendar years 2008 and 2009 resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in the fourth quarter of calendar 2008 and the first quarter of calendar 2009 there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt  significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years and the unemployment rate has not recovered to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued high energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations  our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees  we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 76000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata and autoanything we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates  inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses and meet our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales    13    table of contents our ability to grow depends in part on new store openings existing store remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network  our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new stores and expand and remodel existing stores to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing store expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded stores at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the store management level and the integration of new stores into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded stores profitably  in addition we extensively utilize hub stores our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our stores we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our stores which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins  our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name  we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media  failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation  damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation  failure to protect the privacy and security of customers autozoners or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs  our business involves the storage and transmission of personal information about our customers and autozoners failure to protect the security of our customers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and our reputation could suffer while we take significant steps to protect customer employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry

them may result in certain of our stores being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected  in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers  we rely heavily on our computer systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business  we rely extensively on our computer systems to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems are subject to damage or

at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we are also investigating and will be addressing potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses

13 2014 collectively the directives that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory we have contested any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe we should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow  in july

operations  we are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 30 2014 operated 4984 stores in the united states including puerto rico 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil each of our stores carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 30 2014 in 3845 of our domestic stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select stores in mexico and brazil we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services  executive summary  we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2014 delivering record net income of 1070 billion a 52 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 3278 million a 36 increase over the prior year we completed the year with growth in all areas of our business we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment over the past several years various factors have occurred within the economy that affects both our consumer and our industry including continued high unemployment and other challenging economic conditions although new vehicle sales have increased over previous years we believe our consumers cash flows continue to be challenged due to these factors given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long these trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future we continue to believe we are well positioned to help our customers save money and meet their needs in a challenging macro environment  another macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry is gas prices during fiscal 2014 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 348 per gallon compared to 365 per gallon during fiscal 2013 with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month we continue to believe gas prices have an impact on our customers abilities to maintain their vehicles allowing us to communicate through our marketing messages the steps needed to improve their gas mileage given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods  during fiscal 2014 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years    20    table of contents our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product quantities and assortment specifically during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment as a result we are performing certain strategic tests including adding additional inventory into our hub stores increasing product availability and delivering to stores more frequently  the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road  miles driven  we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2014 latest publicly available information miles driven increased slightly compared to the same period last year  seven year old or older vehicles  between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2014 the average age of vehicles on the road is 114 years as compared to 113 years as of january 1 2013 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell  results of operations  fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013  for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we reported net sales of 9475 billion compared with 9148 billion for the year ended august 31 2013 a 36 increase from fiscal 2013 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 28 and net sales of 1659 million comprised of sales from new stores and increased commercial programs excluding the 53rd week last year sales increased 56  at august 30 2014 we operated 4984 domestic stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil compared with 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three in brazil at august 31 2013 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil sales increase of 31 for fiscal 2014 excluding the 53rd week last year total auto parts sales increased 51  gross profit for fiscal 2014 was 4935 billion or 521 of net sales compared with 4741 billion or 518 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs and lower shrink expense partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 17 basis points  operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2014 increased to 3105 billion or 328 of net sales from 2968 billion or 324 of net sales for fiscal 2013 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll 11 basis points and planned information system investments 10 basis points    21    table of contents interest expense net for fiscal 2014 was 1675 million compared with 1854 million during fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2014 were 4274 billion compared with 3927 billion for fiscal 2013 and weighted average borrowing rates were 36 for fiscal 2014 compared to 45 for fiscal 2013  our effective income tax rate was 357 of pretax income for fiscal 2014 compared to 360 for fiscal 2013  net income for fiscal 2014 increased by 52 to 1070 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 136 to 3157 from 2779 in fiscal 2013 the impact of the fiscal 2014 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was an increase of approximately 104  fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012  for the fiscal year ended august 31 2013 we reported net sales of 9148 billion compared with 8604 billion for the year ended august 25 2012 a 63 increase from fiscal 2012 this growth was driven primarily by sales from new stores of 2223 million the 53rd week sales of 1777 million and sales from autoanything for a portion of the fiscal year  at august 31 2013 we operated 4836 domestic stores 362 stores in mexico and three stores in brazil compared with 4685 domestic stores 321 stores in mexico and none in brazil at august 25 2012 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico and brazil operations sales increase of 52 for fiscal 2013  gross profit for fiscal 2013 was 4741 billion or 518 of net sales compared with 4432 billion or 515 of net sales for fiscal 2012 the improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by lower product acquisition costs partially offset by the inclusion of autoanything 28 basis points  operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2013 increased to 2968 billion or 324 of net sales from 2803 billion or 326 of net sales for fiscal 2012 operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved due to lower incentive compensation 19 basis points partially offset by lower sales growth rates  interest expense net for fiscal 2013 was 1854 million compared with 1759 million during fiscal 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher average borrowing levels over the comparable prior year period partially offset by a decline in borrowing rates average borrowings for fiscal 2013 were 3927 billion compared with 3507 billion for fiscal 2012 and weighted average borrowing rates were 45 for fiscal 2013 compared to 47 for fiscal 2012  our effective income tax rate was 360 of pretax income for fiscal 2013 compared to 360 for fiscal 2012  net income for fiscal 2013 increased by 93 to 1016 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 183 to 2779 from 2348 in fiscal 2012 the impact of the fiscal 2013 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2013 was an increase of approximately 109  in december 2012 we acquired certain assets and liabilities of autoanything an online retailer of specialized automotive products for 116 million with the acquisition we expect to bolster our online presence in the automotive accessory and performance markets the results of operations from autoanything have been included in our other business activities since the date of acquisition  we performed our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 for the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset related to the acquisition of autoanything based on an analysis of autoanythings revised planned financial results compared to the initial projections we determined it was more likely than not the goodwill attributed to autoanything was impaired accordingly we performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill because the fair value of the reporting unit was lower than its carrying value we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of 183 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 based on our evaluation of the future discounted cash flows of autoanythings trade name as compared to its carrying value it was determined that autoanythings trade name was also impaired we recorded an impairment charge of 41 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the trade name    22    table of contents based on the revised plan financial results we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore we adjusted the fair value of the contingent consideration at august 31 2013 to 02 million resulting in a decrease to the contingent consideration liability of 233 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the net impact of the impairment charges and the contingent consideration adjustment is a gain of 09 million for fiscal 2013 the net impact is included in operating selling general and administrative expenses in our other business activities  seasonality and quarterly periods  our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 25 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil  each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2014 17 weeks in 2013 and 16 weeks in 2012 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 represented 321 of annual sales and 348 of net income   liquidity and capital resources  the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts and products net cash provided by operating activities was 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 and 1224 billion in fiscal 2012 cash flows from operations are unfavorable to last year due to the change in inventories net of payables partially offset by the growth in net income we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1149 at august 30 2014 1156 at august 31 2013 and 1114 at august 25 2012 our inventory increases are primarily attributable to our efforts to update product assortments in all of our stores and an increased number of stores during fiscal 2013 and 2014 we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per store many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio  our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newstore development program from the beginning of fiscal 2012 to august 30 2014 we have opened 580 new stores net cash flows used in investing activities were 4480 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 5273 million in fiscal 2013 and 3748 million in fiscal 2012 we invested 4381 million in capital assets in fiscal 2014 compared to 4145 million in fiscal 2013 and 3781 million in fiscal 2012 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of stores opened and increased investment in our existing stores new store openings were 190 for fiscal 2014 197 for fiscal 2013 and 193 for fiscal 2012 cash flows used for purchasing intangibles were 111 million for fiscal 2014 cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 there were no purchases of intangibles or acquisitions in fiscal 2012 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 497 million of marketable securities in fiscal 2014 445 million in fiscal 2013 and 457 million in fiscal 2012 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 468 million in fiscal 2014 379 million in fiscal 2013 and 424 million in fiscal 2012 capital asset disposals provided proceeds of 42 million in fiscal 2014 98 million in fiscal 2013 and 66 million in fiscal 2012    23    table of contents net cash used in financing activities was 9116 million in fiscal 2014 8470 million in fiscal 2013 and 8434 million in fiscal 2012 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1099 billion for fiscal 2014 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 and 1363 billion for fiscal 2012 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 400 million for fiscal 2014 800 million for fiscal 2013 and 500 million for fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2014 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 in fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in fiscal 2013 were also used for the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings there were no repayments of debt in fiscal 2012 in 2014 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 2568 million in 2013 net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 1187 million in 2012 net payments of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings were 813 million  subsequent to august 30 2014 we purchased interamerican motor corporation imc the second largest distributor of oe quality import replacement parts in the united states for approximately 80 million imc specializes in parts coverage for european and asian cars and it currently operates 17 branches the transaction closed on september 27 2014 and was financed with commercial paper borrowings  during fiscal 2015 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2014 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our newstore development program enhancements to existing stores and supply chain infrastructure and the acquisition of imc the amount of our investments in our newstore program is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 6 10 and 18 respectively as compared to the prior year our mix of store openings has moved away from buildtosuit leases lower initial capital investment to ground leases and land purchases higher initial capital investment resulting in increased capital expenditures per store over the previous three years and we expect this trend to continue during the fiscal year ending august 29 2015  in addition to the building and land costs our newstore development program requires working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate  depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past  our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents of 193 million and 382 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations  for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 our aftertax return on invested capital roic was 319 as compared to 327 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit    24    table of contents  excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance  debt facilities  in december 2013 we amended and restated our revolving credit facility increasing the capacity under the revolving credit facility to 125 billion this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility may be increased to 15 billion prior to the maturity date at our election and subject to bank credit capacity and approval may include up to 200 million in letters of credit and may include up to 175 million in capital leases each fiscal year under the revolving credit facility we may borrow funds consisting of eurodollar loans or base rate loans interest accrues on eurodollar loans at a defined eurodollar rate defined as the london interbank offered rate libor plus the applicable percentage as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the revolving credit facility we also have the option to borrow funds under the terms of a swingline loan subfacility the revolving credit facility expires in september 2017  the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 30 2014 was 4951  as of august 30 2014 8938 million of commercial paper borrowings and 3191 million of the 5750 senior notes due january 2015 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility as of august 30 2014 we had 1213 billion of availability under our 125 billion revolving credit facility expiring in september 2017 that would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing  in addition to the revolving credit facility we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 30 2014 we have 1000 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016  in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 314 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 30 2014 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis  on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the shelf registration the shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new store openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due

november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes    25    table of contents the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes issued since august 2008 contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs  as of august 30 2014 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future  for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense ebitdar ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels  stock repurchases  during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the board on june 17 2014 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 1415 billion to 149 billion from january 1998 to august 30 2014 we have repurchased a total of 1369 million shares at an aggregate cost of 14031 billion we repurchased 22 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1099 billion during fiscal 2014 35 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1387 billion during fiscal 2013 and 38 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of 1363 billion during fiscal 2012 considering cumulative repurchases as of august 30 2014 we have 8692 million remaining under the board of directors authorization to repurchase our common stock  subsequent to august 30 2014 we have repurchased 374601 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of

above due to the absence of scheduled maturities and the nature of the account during fiscal 2014 we made contributions of 169 million to the pension plan we expect to make contributions of

of august 30 2014 our defined benefit obligation associated with our pension plans is 3010 million and our pension assets are valued at 2434 million resulting in a net pension obligation of 576 million amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss are 1048 million at august 30 2014 the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into pension expense in the future unless the losses are recovered in future periods through actuarial gains  additionally our tax liability for uncertain tax positions including interest and penalties was 335 million at august 30 2014 approximately 514 thousand is classified as current liabilities and 330 million is classified as longterm liabilities we did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable

accounting pronouncements  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements  critical accounting policies and estimates  preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management  inventory reserves and cost of sales  lifo  we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout lifo method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out fifo method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 3072 million at august 30 2014 calculated using the dollar value method    30    table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 2 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on managements judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods  historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns  additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate  each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use  a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 30 2014 would have affected net income by approximately 63 million in fiscal 2014  vendor allowances  we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products approximately 85 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold  based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is based on our inventory purchases therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years  goodwill and intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss  indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset    31    table of contents  exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates  the carrying value of goodwill at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 was 3678 million during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanythings trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 we also determined autoanything is not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in previous fiscal years no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2014 or in previous fiscal years we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to evaluate goodwill or indefinitelived intangibles  selfinsurance reserves  we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 1951 million at august 30 2014 and 1902 million at august 31 2013 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience and changes in our discount rate  the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly  management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 126 million for fiscal 2014  our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2014 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks  income taxes  our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing    32    table of contents  interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 30 2014 we had approximately 335 million reserved for uncertain tax positions  we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement  we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected  pension obligation  prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we have assumed a 75 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the year ending august 29 2015 at august 30 2014 our plan assets totaled 2434 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 12 million for the qualified plan  discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2014 we assumed a discount rate of 43 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 30 2014 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 20 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan    33    table of contents item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes  interest rate risk  our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps  we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks each with a notional amount of 100 million these agreements were cash flow hedges used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 300 million senior note debt issuance in november 2012 the fixed rates of the hedges were 207 and 192 and were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on november 1 2012 and resulted in a loss of 51 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  during the third quarter of fiscal 2012 we entered into two treasury rate locks these agreements were designated as cash flow hedges and were used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to the 500 million senior note debt issuance in april 2012 the treasury rate locks had notional amounts of 300 million and 100 million with associated fixed rates of 209 and 207 respectively the locks were benchmarked based on the 10year us treasury notes these locks expired on april 20 2012 and resulted in a loss of 28 million which has been deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt the hedges remained highly effective until they expired and no ineffectiveness was recognized in earnings  the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4480 billion as of august 30 2014 and 4259 billion as of august 31 2013 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1366 million and 722 million at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 respectively we had 8938 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2014 and 6370 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 31 2013 in fiscal 2014 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 89 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding fixed rate debt of 3450 billion at august 30 2014 and 3550 billion at august 31 2013 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1561 million at august 30 2014    34    table of contents fuel price risk  from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012  foreign currency risk  foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material  we are exposed to euros canadian dollars and brazilian reals but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 4392 million at august 30 2014 and 3787 million at august 31 2013 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso increased by approximately 19 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2014 and decreased by approximately 11 during fiscal 2013 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 30 2014 and august 31 2013 would be approximately 399 million and approximately 344 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations    35    table of contents item 8 financial statements and supplementary data  index             managements report on

and fourth anniversaries of the grant date and generally have 30 or 90 days after the service relationship ends or one year after death to exercise all vested options the fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straightline basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date  in addition to the 2011 plan on december 15 2010 the company adopted the 2011 director compensation program the 2011 program which stated that nonemployee directors would receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 plan under the 2011 program restricted stock units are granted the first day of each calendar quarter the number of restricted stock units granted each quarter is determined by dividing onefourth of the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as of the grant date the restricted stock units are fully vested on the date they are issued and are paid in shares of the companys common stock subsequent to the nonemployee director ceasing to be a member of the board    49    table of

portion of a directors compensation to be paid in cash at the nonemployee directors election the program replaces the 2011 director compensation program under the program restricted stock units are

grant date or the date the nonemployee director ceases to be a member of the board separation from service nonemployee directors may elect to defer receipt of the restricted stock units until their separation from service the cash portion of the award if elected is paid ratably over the remaining calendar quarters the company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the blackscholesmerton multipleoption pricing valuation model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense the following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related sharebased

methodologies were applied in developing the assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted  expected price volatility  this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility the company calculates daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense    50    table of contents riskfree interest rate  this is the us treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense  expected lives  this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense  forfeiture rate  this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested this estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense this estimate is evaluated periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate  dividend yield  the company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense  the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was 9697 during fiscal 2014 9858 during fiscal 2013 and 9471 during fiscal 2012 the intrinsic value of

fair value measurements  the company has adopted asc topic 820 fair value measurement which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements this standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value and although it does not require additional fair value measurements it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels  level 1 inputs  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access an active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information  level 2 inputs  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability level 2 inputs include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities credit risk and default rates  level 3 inputs  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability    55

attributable to expected synergies and the assembled workforce the contingent consideration is based on the achievement of certain performance metrics through calendar year 2014 with any earned payments due during the first calendar quarter of 2014 and 2015 the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was 227 million  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 the
