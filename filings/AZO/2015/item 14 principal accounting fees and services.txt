satisfaction of our customers is often impacted by our ability to provide specific automotive products as requested each store carries the same basic products but we tailor our hard parts inventory to the makes and models of the vehicles in each stores trade area and our sales floor products are tailored to the local stores demographics our hub stores including mega hubs which carry an even broader assortment carry a larger assortment of products that are delivered to local satellite stores we are constantly updating the products we offer to ensure that our inventory matches the products our customers need or desire  pricing  we want to be perceived by our customers as the value leader in our industry by consistently providing quality merchandise at the right price backed by a satisfactory warranty and outstanding customer service for many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a goodbetterbest assortment with appropriate price and quality differences from the good products to the better and best products a key differentiating component versus our competitors is our exclusive line of inhouse brands which includes the valucraft autozone surebilt proelite duralast duralast gold duralast platinum and duralast propower brands we believe that our overall value compares favorably to that of our competitors  brand marketing advertising and promotions  we believe that targeted advertising and promotions play important roles in succeeding in todays environment we are constantly working to understand our customers wants and needs so that we can build longlasting loyal relationships we utilize promotions advertising and loyalty card programs primarily to advise customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance our great value and the availability of high quality parts broadcast and internet media are our primary advertising methods of driving traffic to our stores we utilize instore signage instore circulars and creative product placement and promotions to help educate customers about products that they need  store design and visual merchandising  we design and build stores for high visual impact the typical autozone store utilizes colorful exterior and interior signage exposed beams and ductwork and brightly lit interiors maintenance products accessories and nonautomotive items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers instore signage and special displays promote products on floor displays end caps and shelves  commercial  our commercial sales program operates in a highly fragmented market and we are one of the leading distributors of automotive parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts in the united states puerto rico and mexico as a part of the domestic store program we    4    table of contents  offer credit and delivery to our customers as well as online ordering through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet through our hub stores we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians we have dedicated sales teams focused on independent repair shops as well as national regional and public sector commercial accounts  store operations  store formats  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance merchandising and product mix approximately 85 to 90 of each stores square footage is selling space of which approximately 40 to 45 is dedicated to hard parts inventory the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by counters or pods that run the depth or length of the store dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store the remaining selling space contains displays of maintenance accessories and nonautomotive items  we believe that our stores are destination stores generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores therefore we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking  store personnel and training  each store typically employs from 10 to 16 autozoners including a manager and in some cases an assistant manager we provide onthejob training as well as formal training programs including an annual national sales meeting regular store meetings on specific sales and product topics standardized training manuals and computer based modules and a specialist program that provides training to autozoners in several areas of technical expertise from the company our vendors and independent certification agencies all domestic autozoners are encouraged to complete tests resulting in certifications by the national institute for automotive service excellence ase which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry training is supplemented with frequent store visits by management  store managers sales representatives commercial sales managers and managers at various levels across the organization receive financial incentives through performancebased bonuses in addition our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners we believe these opportunities are important to attract motivate and retain high quality autozoners  all store support functions are centralized in our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico chihuahua mexico sao paulo brazil and canoga park california we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level while reducing expenses and cost of sales  store automation  all of our autozone stores have znet our proprietary electronic catalog that enables our autozoners to efficiently look up the parts that our customers need and to provide complete job solutions advice and information for customer vehicles znet provides parts information based on the year make model and engine type of a vehicle and also tracks inventory availability at the store at other nearby stores and through special order the znet display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both the autozoner and customer can view the screen  our autozone stores utilize our computerized proprietary store management system which includes bar code scanning and pointofsale data collection terminals the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures    5    table of

in markets that we do not currently serve as well as in markets where we can achieve a larger presence we undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets the most important criteria for opening a new autozone store or imc branch are the projected future profitability and the ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate key factors in selecting new site and market locations for autozone stores and imc branches include population demographics vehicle profile customer buying trends commercial businesses number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate in reviewing the vehicle profile we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older or our kind of vehicles these vehicles are generally no longer under the original manufacturers warranties and require more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles we seek to open new autozone stores in high visibility sites in high traffic locations within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in markets in a relatively short period of time when selecting future sites and market locations for our imc branches we look for locations close to major highways to support imcs delivery schedule and also consider the population of autozone stores in the market in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own locations we evaluate and may make strategic acquisitions  purchasing and supply chain  merchandise is selected and purchased for all autozone stores through our store support centers located in memphis tennessee monterrey mexico and sao paulo brazil merchandise is selected and purchased for all imc branches through our store support center located in canoga park california in fiscal 2015 one class of similar products accounted for approximately 11 percent of our total sales and one vendor supplied approximately 11 percent of our purchases no other class of similar products accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales and no other individual vendor provided more than 10 percent of our total purchases we believe that alternative sources of supply exist at similar costs for most types of product sold most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers to our stores by our fleet of tractors and trailers or by thirdparty trucking firms  our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to many of our stores and to expand our product assortment a hub store has a larger assortment of products as well as regular replenishment items that can be delivered to a store in its network within 24 hours hub stores are generally replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week  during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we tested two specific new concepts of our supply chain strategy increased frequency of delivery to our stores and significantly expanded parts assortments in select stores we call mega hubs a mega hub store carries inventory of 80000 to 100000 unique skus approximately twice what a hub store carries mega hubs provide coverage to both surrounding stores and other hub stores multiple times a day or on an overnight basis as part of these tests we have incorporated more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to a group of test stores our tests were concluded during fiscal 2015 and both initiatives are expected to be expanded to additional locations in fiscal 2016 and beyond    6    table of contents competition  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas

could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business  if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially affected  demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including           the number and age of vehicles in current service vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles           rising energy prices increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs and may drive their vehicles less resulting in less wear and tear and lower demand for repairs and maintenance           the economy in periods of declining economic conditions both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repairs additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit during periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles           the weather mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts           technological advances advances in automotive technology and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  for the long term demand for our products may be affected by           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles           restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation which may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs  all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are

greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  we have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4627 locations at august 28 2010 to 5609 locations at august 29 2015 an average store location increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 7363 billion in fiscal 2010 to 10187 billion in fiscal 2015 an average increase per year of 8 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales  consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business  recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business  if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited  although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must

customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited    11    table of contents a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities  our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings  moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in recent years there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in recent years will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit market could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt  significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years however towards the end of fiscal 2015 the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations  our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees  we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 81000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata autoanything and imc our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows    12    table of contents inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  we are dependent upon our vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses and meet our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales  our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network  our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the location management level and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably  in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins  our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability  we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media  failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating    13    table of contents  expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation  our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets  the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy  in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance  failure to protect the privacy and security of customers suppliers autozoners or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs  our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers suppliers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in additional costs  we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business  we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations    14    table of contents business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business  war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected  in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are

service station and contained evidence of groundwater contamination upon acquisition we voluntarily reported the groundwater contamination issue to the new jersey department of environmental protection and entered into a voluntary remediation agreement providing for the remediation of the contamination associated with the property we have conducted and paid for at an immaterial cost to us remediation of contamination on the property we have also voluntarily investigated and addressed potential vapor intrusion impacts in downgradient residences and businesses the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep has asserted in a directive and notice to insurers dated february 19 2013 and again in an amended directive and notice to insurers dated january 13 2014 collectively the directives that we are liable for the downgradient impacts under a joint and severable liability theory by letter dated april 23 2015 njdep has demanded payment from us and other parties in the amount of approximately 296 thousand for costs incurred by njdep in connection with contamination downgradient of the property we have contested and will continue to contest any such assertions due to the existence of other entitiessources of contamination some of which are named in the directives and the april 23 2015 demand in the area of the property pursuant to the voluntary remediation agreement upon completion of all remediation required by the agreement we believe it should be eligible to be reimbursed up to 75 percent of qualified remediation costs by the state of new jersey we have asked the state for clarification that the agreement applies to offsite work and the state is considering the request although the aggregate amount of additional costs that we may incur pursuant to the remediation cannot currently be ascertained we do not currently believe that fulfillment of our obligations under the agreement or otherwise will result in costs that are material to our financial condition results of operations or cash flow  in july 2014 we received a subpoena from the district attorney of the county of alameda along with other environmental prosecutorial offices in

outcome of these efforts  we are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business including several lawsuits containing classaction allegations in which the

the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 29 2015 operated 5141 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 29 2015 in 4141 of our domestic autozone stores we also have a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in select autozone stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories and performance parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services  executive summary  we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2015 delivering record net income of 1160 billion an 85 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 7120 million a 75 increase over the prior year we are pleased with the results of our retail business and the increase in our commercial business where we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment  our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future  one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2015 was gas prices during fiscal 2015 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 269 per gallon compared to 348 per gallon during fiscal 2014 we believe reduced gas prices gave our customers additional disposable income with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods    20    table of contents during fiscal 2015 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our strongest performers while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure related categories we believe the increase in failure related products is largely due to increased miles driven and favorable weather related impacts in various regions of the us  our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment specifically during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we have closely studied our hub distribution model and store inventory levels and assortment and performed strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our stores and significantly expanding parts assortments in select stores during fiscal 2015 we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts and have plans to continue to roll out these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 and beyond  the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road  miles driven  we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2015 latest publicly available information miles driven increased compared to the same period last year  seven year old or older vehicles  between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2015 the average age of vehicles on the road is 115 years as compared to 114 years as of january 1 2014 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell  effective september 27 2014 we acquired the outstanding stock of interamerican motor corporation imc the second largest distributor of quality import replacement parts in the united states for 757 million net of cash imc specializes in parts coverage for european and asian cars with this acquisition we expect to grow our share in the aftermarket import car parts market the results of operations from imc have been included in our auto parts locations business activities since the date of acquisition  results of operations  fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014  for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we reported net sales of 10187 billion compared with 9475 billion for the year ended august 30 2014 a 75 increase from fiscal 2014 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 38 net sales of 1851 million from new stores and the inclusion of imc sales    21    table of contents at august 29 2015 we

billion or 521 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins partially offset by the impact of the imc acquisition finalized during september 2014 25 basis points and higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 13 basis points  operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2015 increased to 3374 billion or 331 of net sales from 3105 billion or 328 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs 14 basis points and the impact of imc 13 basis points  interest expense net for fiscal 2015 was 1504 million compared with 1675 million during fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2015 were 4520 billion compared with 4252 billion for fiscal 2014 and

per share in fiscal 2015 was an increase of approximately 101  fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013  for the fiscal year ended august 30 2014 we reported net sales of 9475 billion compared with 9148 billion for the year ended august 31 2013 a 36 increase from fiscal 2013 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 28 and net sales of 1659 million comprised of sales from new stores excluding the 53rd week in fiscal 2013 sales increased 56  at august 30 2014 we operated 4984 domestic autozone stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil compared with 4836

was 1675 million compared with 1854 million during fiscal 2013 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year

   table of contents our effective income tax rate was 357 of pretax income for fiscal 2014 compared to 360 for fiscal 2013  net income for fiscal 2014 increased by 52 to 1070 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 136 to 3157 from 2779 in fiscal 2013 the impact of the fiscal 2014 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2014 was an increase of approximately 104  seasonality and quarterly periods  our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have stores throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil  each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2015 and 2014 and 17 weeks in 2013 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 represented 323 of annual sales and 346 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 represented 338 of annual sales and 365 of net income  liquidity and capital resources  the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1525 billion in 2015 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 and 1415 billion in fiscal 2013 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year due to the growth in net income and the timing of income tax deductions  our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program from the beginning of fiscal 2013 to august 29 2015 we have opened 589 new locations net cash flows used in investing activities were 5679 million compared to 4480 million in fiscal 2014 and 5273 million in fiscal 2013 we invested 4806 million in capital assets in fiscal 2015 compared to 4381 million in fiscal 2014 and 4145 million in fiscal 2013 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of locations opened increased investment in our existing locations and the acquisition of imc new location openings were 202 for fiscal 2015 190 for fiscal 2014 and 197 for fiscal 2013 cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were 757 million in fiscal 2015 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in the same period in fiscal 2014 cash flows were used to purchase intangibles for 111 million cash flows used in the acquisition of autoanything were 1161 million during fiscal 2013 we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 497 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2015 497 million in fiscal 2014 and 445 million in fiscal 2013 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 464 million in fiscal 2015 468 million in fiscal 2014 and 379 million in fiscal 2013  net cash used in financing activities was 8967 million in 2015 9116 million in fiscal 2014 and 8470 million in fiscal 2013 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1271 billion for fiscal 2015 1099 billion for fiscal 2014 and 1387 billion for fiscal 2013 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 650 million for fiscal 2015 400 million for fiscal 2014 and 800 million for fiscal 2013 in fiscal 2015 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases proceeds from the issuance of debt in    23    table of contents  fiscal 2015 were also used for the acquisition of imc in fiscal 2014 the proceeds from the issuance of debt was used for the repayment of a portion of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 in fiscal 2013 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes and the acquisition of autoanything in fiscal 2013 we repaid our 200 million senior notes due in june 2013 and our 300 million senior notes due in october 2012 using commercial paper borrowings in 2015 we received proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1538 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2014 and 2013 were 2568 million and 1187 million respectively  during fiscal 2016 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2015 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2015 2014 and fiscal 2013 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 10 6 and 10 respectively as compared to the prior year  in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio during fiscal 2013 2014 and 2015 we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1129 at august 29 2015 1149 at august 30 2014 and 1156 at august 31 2013 the decrease from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was driven by the inclusion of imc we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate  depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past  our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 cash and cash equivalents of 649 million and 193 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations  for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 our aftertax return on invested capital roic was 312 as compared to 321 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by average invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases the decrease in roic is primarily due to the increase in average debt along with the impact of recent investments in the business the return on these investments is currently diluting our operating margins we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance    24    table of contents debt facilities  on december 19 2014 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility the multiyear credit agreement by increasing the amount of capital leases allowable to 225 million extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility

revolving credit facilities and 35 million of outstanding letters of credit under the multiyear credit agreement  the revolving credit facility agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2501 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 29 2015 was 531  as of august 29 2015 1048 billion of commercial paper borrowings the 300 million 5500 senior notes due november 2015 and the 200 million 6950 notes due june 2016 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 29 2015 we had 1711 billion of availability under our 1750 billion revolving credit facilities which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing  in addition to the revolving credit facilities we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million as of august 29 2015 we had 820 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility which expires in june 2016  in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 212 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 29 2015 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis  on april 29 2015 we issued 400 million in 3250 notes due april 2025 and 250 million in 2500 notes due april 2021 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the new shelf registration the new shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes    25    table of contents on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6500 senior notes  on april 29 2013 we issued 500 million in 3125 senior notes due july 2023 under its shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on april 29 2013 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 200 million in 4375 senior notes due june 2013 and for general corporate purposes  on november 13 2012 we issued 300 million in 2875 senior notes due january 2023 under the shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuance on november 13 2012 were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 300 million in 5875 senior notes due in october 2012 and for general corporate purposes  the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes issued since august 2008 contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our other senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facility covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs  as of august 29 2015 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future  for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense ebitdar ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information

notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  recent accounting pronouncements  see note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements  critical accounting policies and estimates  preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management    30    table of contents inventory reserves and cost of sales  lifo  we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the lastin firstout lifo method for domestic merchandise and the firstin first out fifo method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases our domestic inventory balances are effectively maintained under the fifo method we do not write up inventory for favorable lifo adjustments and due to price deflation lifo costs of our domestic inventories exceed replacement costs by 3326 million at august 29 2015 calculated using the dollar value method    31    table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 3 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on managements judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods  historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns  additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate  each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use  a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 29 2015 would have affected net income by approximately 61 million in fiscal 2015  vendor allowances  we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold  based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years  goodwill and intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss  indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset    32    table of contents  exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates  the carrying value of goodwill at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 was 3919 million and 3678 million respectively during fiscal fourth quarter of 2013 we recorded an 183 million goodwill impairment charge in our other business activities related to the goodwill of autoanything and a 41 million impairment charge to autoanythings trade name the 41 million impairment charge resulted in a remaining carrying value of 246 million at august 31 2013 we also determined autoanything was not likely to achieve the operating income targets necessary to earn the contingent consideration therefore these impairment charges were offset by an adjustment of 233 million to the contingent consideration liability to reflect its fair value at august 31 2013 no impairment charges were recognized in our other business activities in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 no impairment charges were recognized in the auto parts stores reporting segment during fiscal 2015 or in previous fiscal years  selfinsurance reserves  we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2053 million at august 29 2015 and 1951 million at august 30 2014 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience  the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly  management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 132 million for fiscal 2015  our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 20 million for fiscal 2015 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks  income taxes  our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing    33    table of contents  interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 29 2015 we had approximately 285 million reserved for uncertain tax positions  we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement  we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected  pension obligation  prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we have assumed a 70 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the year ended august 29 2015 at august 29 2015 our plan assets totaled 2388 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 12 million for the qualified plan  discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities this same discount rate is also used to determine pension expense for the following plan year for fiscal 2015 we assumed a discount rate of 45 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 29 2015 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 19 million for the qualified plan and 30 thousand for the nonqualified plan    34    table of contents item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes  interest rate risk  our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps  we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings  the fair value of our debt was estimated at 4696 billion as of august 29 2015 and 4480 billion as of august 30 2014 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 707 million and 1573 million at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 respectively we had 1048 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2015 and 8938 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 30 2014 in fiscal 2015 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 105 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding debt of 3577 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 227 million at august 29 2015 and 3429 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 207 million at august 30 2014 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1601 million at august 29 2015  fuel price risk  from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment in fiscal 2015 we entered into a fuel swap to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel usage the notional amount of the contract was 29 million gallons and terminated march 31 2015 the swap had no significant impact on the results of operations we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013  foreign currency risk  foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material  we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars   35    table of contents we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3667 million at august 29 2015 and 4392 million at august 30 2014 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 29 with respect to the us dollar during fiscal 2015 and increased by approximately 19 during fiscal 2014 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 29 2015 and august 30 2014 would be approximately 333 million and approximately 399 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations    36    table of

the grant date and generally have 30 or 90 days after the service relationship ends or one year after death to exercise all vested options the fair value of each option grant is separately estimated for each vesting date the fair value of each option is amortized into compensation expense on a straightline basis between the grant date for the award and each vesting date    50    table of contents in addition to the 2011 plan on december 15 2010 the company adopted the 2011 director compensation program the 2011 program which stated that nonemployee directors would receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 plan under the 2011 program restricted stock units are granted the first day of each calendar quarter the number of restricted stock units granted each quarter is determined by dividing onefourth of the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as of the grant date the restricted stock units are fully vested on the date they are issued and are paid in shares of the companys common stock subsequent to the nonemployee director ceasing to be a member of the board  the 2011 program replaced the 2003 comp plan and the 2003 option plan under the 2003 comp plan nonemployee directors could receive no more than onehalf of their director fees immediately in cash and the remainder of the fees was required to be

directors will receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 equity incentive award plan with an option for a certain portion of a directors compensation to be paid in cash at the nonemployee directors election the program replaces the 2011 director compensation program under the program restricted stock units are granted january 1 of each year the grant date the number of restricted stock units is determined by dividing the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as of the grant date the restricted stock units are fully vested on january 1 of each year and are paid in shares of the companys common stock on the earlier to occur of the fifth anniversary of the grant date or the date the nonemployee director ceases to be a member of the board separation from service nonemployee directors may elect to defer receipt of the restricted stock units until their separation from service the cash portion of the award if elected is paid ratably over the remaining calendar quarters  the company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the blackscholesmerton multipleoption pricing valuation model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense the following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related sharebased compensation expense

applied in developing the assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted  expected price volatility  this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility the company calculates daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense  riskfree interest rate  this is the us treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense  expected lives  this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense  forfeiture rate  this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested this estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense this estimate is evaluated periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate  dividend yield  the company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense  the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted was 10627 during fiscal 2015 9697 during fiscal 2014 and 9858 during fiscal 2013 the intrinsic value of options exercised was 1548 million in

requirements about fair value measurements this standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value and although it does not require additional fair value measurements it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels  level 1 inputs  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access an active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information  level 2 inputs  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability level 2 inputs include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities credit risk and default rates  level 3 inputs  unobservable inputs for the asset or liability  financial assets amp
