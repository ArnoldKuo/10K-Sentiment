director received an option to purchase 3000 shares upon election to the board plus a portion of the annual directors option grant prorated for the portion of the year actually served these stock option grants were made at the fair market value as of the grant date and generally vested three years from the grant date there were 24000 and 32000 outstanding options under the 2003 option plan as of august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 respectively no additional shares of stock will be issued in future years under the 2003 option plan  during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 the company adopted the 2014 director compensation program the program which states that nonemployee directors will receive their compensation in awards of restricted stock units under the 2011 plan with an option for a certain portion of a directors compensation to be paid in cash at the nonemployee directors election the program replaces the 2011 program under the program restricted stock units are granted january 1 of each year the grant date the number of restricted stock units is determined by dividing the amount of the annual retainer by the fair market value of the shares of common stock as of the grant date the restricted stock units are fully vested on january 1 of each year and are paid in shares of the companys common stock on the earlier to occur of the fifth anniversary of the grant date or the date the nonemployee director ceases to be a member of the board separation from service nonemployee directors may elect to defer receipt of the restricted stock units until their separation from service the cash portion of the award if elected is paid ratably over the remaining calendar quarters  the company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the date of the grant by applying the blackscholesmerton multipleoption pricing valuation model the application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense the following table presents the weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted and the related sharebased compensation expense

developing the assumptions used in determining the fair value of options granted  expected price volatility  this is a measure of the amount by which a price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate the company uses actual historical changes in the market value of its stock to calculate the volatility assumption as it is managements belief that this is the best indicator of future volatility the company calculates daily market value changes from the date of grant over a past period representative of the expected life of the options to determine volatility an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense  riskfree interest rate  this is the us treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term equal to the expected life of the option an increase in the riskfree interest rate will increase compensation expense  expected lives  this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes options granted have a maximum term of ten years or ten years and one day an increase in the expected life will increase compensation expense    54    table of contents forfeiture rate  this is the estimated percentage of options granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested this estimate is based on historical experience at the time of valuation and reduces expense ratably over the vesting period an increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense this estimate is evaluated periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ or are expected to differ from the previous estimate  dividend yield  the company has not made any dividend payments nor does it have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense  the weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted was 15620 during fiscal 2016 10627 during fiscal 2015 and 9697 during fiscal 2014 the intrinsic value of options exercised was

measuring fair value in gaap and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements this standard defines fair value as the price received to transfer an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date asc topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value by creating a hierarchy of valuation inputs used to measure fair value and although it does not require additional fair value measurements it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels  level 1 inputs  unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access an active market for the asset or liability is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information  level 2 inputs  inputs other than quoted market prices included in level 1 that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability level 2 inputs include but are not limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rate curves and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities credit risk and default rates  level 3 inputs  unobservable inputs for the

future compensation levels no longer impact the calculation and there is no service cost  the discount rate to determine the projected benefit obligation is determined as of the measurement date and is based on the calculated yield of a portfolio of highgrade corporate bonds with cash flows that generally match the companys expected benefit payments in future years  during fiscal 2016 the company changed the method used to estimate the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost previously the company estimated interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the company elected to utilize a spot rate approach by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve to calculate interest costs instead of a single weightedaverage discount rate this calculation is believed to be more refined under the applicable accounting standard the impact of this change to net periodic benefit cost is a reduction of 18 million in fiscal 2016 the company accounted for this change as a change in accounting estimate and accounted for it prospectively  the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on the historical relationships between the investment classes and the capital markets updated for current conditions  the company makes annual contributions in amounts at least equal to the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 the company contributed 527 million to the plans in fiscal 2016 171 million to the plans in fiscal 2015 and 169 million to the plans in fiscal 2014 the company expects to contribute approximately 178 million to the plans in fiscal 2017 however a change to the expected cash funding may be impacted by a change in interest rates a change in the actual or expected return on plan assets or through other plans initiated by management  based on current assumptions about future events benefit payments are expected to be paid
