  we are the nations leading retailer and a leading distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the united states we began operations in 1979 and at august 27 2016 operated 5297 autozone stores in the united states including puerto rico 483 stores in mexico eight stores in brazil and 26 imc branches each autozone store carries an extensive product line for cars sport utility vehicles vans and light trucks including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products at august 27 2016 in 4390 of our domestic autozone stores we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local regional and national repair garages dealers service stations and public sector accounts we also have commercial programs in autozone stores in mexico and brazil imc branches carry an extensive line of original equipment quality import replacement parts we also sell the alldata brand automotive diagnostic and repair software through wwwalldatacom and wwwalldatadiycom additionally we sell automotive hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products through wwwautozonecom and accessories performance and replacement parts through wwwautoanythingcom and our commercial customers can make purchases through wwwautozoneprocom and wwwimcpartsnet we do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services  executive summary  we achieved strong performance in fiscal 2016 delivering record net income of 1241 billion a 70 increase over the prior year and sales growth of 4483 million a 44 increase over the prior year both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we continue to build our internal sales force and refine our parts assortment  our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry including but not limited to fuel costs unemployment rates and other economic conditions given the nature of these macroeconomic factors we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future  one macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2016 was gas prices during fiscal 2016 the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the united states was 214 per gallon compared to 269 per gallon during fiscal 2015 we believe reduced gas prices gave our customers additional disposable income with approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the us each 1 decrease at the pump contributes approximately 11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month given the unpredictability of gas prices we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods  during fiscal 2016 failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix at approximately 84 of total sales with failure related categories continuing to be our largest set of categories while we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years in our domestic stores we did experience a slight increase in mix of sales of the failure and discretionary categories as compared to last year we believe the improvement in these sales categories was driven by    23    table of contents  differences in regional weather patterns improved merchandise assortments due to the products we have added over the last year and lower gas prices our sales mix can be impacted by severe or unusual weather over a short term period over the long term we believe the impact of the weather on our sales mix is not significant  our primary response to fluctuations in the demand for the products we sell is to adjust our advertising message store staffing and product assortment in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability in our domestic stores as part of those tests we closely studied our hub distribution model store inventory levels and product assortment which led to strategic tests on increased frequency of delivery to our domestic stores and significantly expanding parts assortment in select domestic stores we call mega hubs during fiscal 2015 we concluded our tests on these specific new concepts and continued to roll out these strategic initiatives in fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2016 we continued the implementation of more frequent deliveries from our distribution centers to additional domestic stores and the execution of our mega hub strategy we expect to continue this effort in fiscal 2017 and beyond  the two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the longterm are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road  miles driven  we believe that as the number of miles driven increases consumers vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items while over the longterm we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven during the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors including the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road since the beginning of the fiscal year and through june 2016 latest publicly available information miles driven increased compared to the same period last year  seven year old or older vehicles  between 2008 and 2012 new vehicle sales were significantly lower than historical levels which we believe contributed to an increasing number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road we estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12500 miles each year in seven years the average miles driven equates to approximately 87500 miles our experience is that at this point in a vehicles life most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating according to the latest data provided by the auto care association as of january 1 2016 the average age of vehicles on the road is 116 years as compared to 115 years as of january 1 2015 although the average age of vehicles continues to increase it is increasing at a decelerated rate primarily driven by the improvement in new car sales in recent years however in the near term we expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money during this uncertain economy as the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell  results of operations  fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015  for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 we reported net sales of 10636 billion compared with 10187 billion for the year ended august 29 2015 a 44 increase from fiscal 2015 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 24 and net sales of 1770 million from new domestic autozone stores domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2016 increased 1298 million or 71 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015  at august 27 2016 we operated 5297 domestic autozone stores 483 stores in mexico eight stores in brazil and 26 imc branches compared with 5141 domestic autozone stores 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches at august 29 2015 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 44 for fiscal 2016  gross profit for fiscal 2016 was 5609 billion or 527 of net sales compared with 5327 billion or 523 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to lower acquisition costs partially offset by higher supply chain costs associated with current year inventory initiatives 18 basis points    24    table of contents operating selling general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2016 increased to 3548 billion or 334 of net sales from 3374 billion or 331 of net sales for fiscal 2015 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher store payroll  interest expense net for fiscal 2016 was 1477 million compared with 1504 million during fiscal 2015 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing rates partially offset by higher borrowing levels over the comparable year period average borrowings for fiscal 2016 were 4860 billion compared with 4520 billion for fiscal 2015 and weighted average borrowing rates were 27 for fiscal 2016 compared to 30 for fiscal 2015  our effective income tax rate was 351 of pretax income for fiscal 2016 compared to 356 for fiscal 2015 the decrease in the effective income tax rate was driven by a discrete tax item during fiscal 2016  net income for fiscal 2016 increased by 70 to 1241 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 130 to 4070 from 3603 in fiscal 2015 the impact of the fiscal 2016 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2016 was an increase of approximately 117  fiscal 2015 compared with fiscal 2014  for the fiscal year ended august 29 2015 we reported net sales of 10187 billion compared with 9475 billion for the year ended august 30 2014 a 75 increase from fiscal 2014 this growth was driven primarily by domestic same store sales increase of 38 net sales of 1851 million from new domestic autozone stores and the inclusion of imc sales domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2015 increased 2084 million or 129 over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2014  at august 29 2015 we operated 5141 domestic autozone stores 441 stores in mexico seven stores in brazil and 20 imc branches compared with 4984 domestic autozone stores 402 stores in mexico and five stores in brazil at august 30 2014 we reported a total auto parts domestic mexico brazil and imc sales increase of 76 for fiscal 2015  gross profit for fiscal 2015 was 5327 billion or 523 of net sales compared with 4935 billion or 521 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the improvement in gross margin was attributable to higher merchandise margins partially offset by the impact of the imc acquisition finalized during september 2014 25

billion or 331 of net sales from 3105 billion or 328 of net sales for fiscal 2014 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher legal costs 14 basis points and the impact of imc 13 basis points  interest expense net for fiscal 2015 was 1504 million compared with 1675 million during fiscal 2014 this decrease was primarily due to a decline in borrowing

2015 increased by 85 to 1160 billion and diluted earnings per share increased 141 to 3603 from 3157 in fiscal 2014 the impact of the fiscal 2015 stock repurchases on diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2015 was an increase of approximately 101    25    table of contents seasonality and quarterly periods  our business is somewhat seasonal in nature with the highest sales typically occurring in the spring and summer months of february through september in which average weekly perstore sales historically have been about 15 to 20 higher than in the slower months of december and january during short periods of time a stores sales can be affected by weather conditions extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail thereby increasing sales of seasonal products mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather with elective maintenance deferred during periods of rainy weather over the longer term the effects of weather balance out as we have locations throughout the united states puerto rico mexico and brazil  each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2016 2015 and 2014 because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 weeks compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 represented 320 of annual sales and 344 of net income the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 represented 323 of annual sales and 346 of net income and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 represented 322 of annual sales and 349 of net income  liquidity and capital resources  the primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts products and accessories net cash provided by operating activities was 1577 billion in 2016 1525 billion in 2015 and 1341 billion in fiscal 2014 cash flows from operations are favorable to last year primarily due to the growth in net income partially offset by an increase in pension contributions  our primary capital requirement has been the funding of our continued newlocation development program from the beginning of fiscal 2014 to august 27 2016 we have opened 597 new locations net cash flows used in investing activities were 5058 million compared to 5679 million in fiscal 2015 and 4480 million in fiscal 2014 we invested 4888 million in capital assets in fiscal 2016 compared to 4806 million in fiscal 2015 and 4381 million in fiscal 2014 the increase in capital expenditures during this time was primarily attributable to the number and types of locations opened and increased investment in our existing locations we had new location openings of 205 for fiscal 2016 202 for fiscal 2015 and 190 for fiscal 2014 cash flows used in the acquisition of imc were 757 million in fiscal 2015 cash flows were also used in the purchase of other intangibles for 10 million in each of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 in fiscal 2014 cash flows were used to purchase intangibles for 111 million we invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable securities we purchased 1302 million in marketable securities in fiscal 2016 and 497 million in each of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we had proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of 1205 million in fiscal 2016 464 million in fiscal 2015 and 468 million in fiscal 2014  net cash used in financing activities was 1053 billion in 2016 8967 million in 2015 and 9116 million in fiscal 2014 the net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock which totaled 1452 billion for fiscal 2016 1271 billion for fiscal 2015 and 1099 billion for fiscal 2014 the treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations and by increases in debt levels proceeds from issuance of debt were 650 million for each of fiscal 2016 and 2015 and 400 million for fiscal 2014 in fiscal 2016 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes including for working capital requirements capital expenditures store openings and stock repurchases in fiscal 2015 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of our outstanding commercial borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million 5750 senior notes due january 2015 and for the acquisition of imc in fiscal 2014 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for the repayment of a portion of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the 300 million senior notes due in november 2015 the 200 million senior notes due in june 2016 and the remainder of the 500 million senior notes due in january 2014 in 2016 we received net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings in the amount of 1499 million net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and shortterm borrowings for fiscal 2015 and 2014 were 1538 million and 2568 million respectively    26    table of contents during fiscal 2017 we expect to invest in our business at an increased rate as compared to fiscal 2016 our investments are expected to be directed primarily to new locations supply chain infrastructure enhancements to existing locations and investments in technology the amount of our investments in our new locations is impacted by different factors including such factors as whether the building and land are purchased requiring higher investment or leased generally lower investment located in the united states mexico or brazil or located in urban or rural areas during fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 our capital expenditures have increased by approximately 2 10 and 6 respectively as compared to the prior year  in addition to the building and land costs our new locations require working capital predominantly for inventories historically we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio we plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases however our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors capacity to factor their receivables from us certain vendors participate in financing arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their receivables from us allowing them to receive payment on our invoices at a discounted rate in recent years we initiated a variety of strategic tests focused on increasing inventory availability which increased our inventory per location many of our vendors have supported our initiative to update our product assortments by providing extended payment terms these extended payment terms have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio we had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 1128 at august 27 2016 1129 at august 29 2015 and 1149 at august 30 2014 the decrease from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 was driven by the inclusion of imc in fiscal 2015  depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures working capital requirements and stock repurchases the balance may be funded through new borrowings we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past  our cash balances are held in various locations around the world as of august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 cash and cash equivalents of 781 million and 649 million respectively were held outside of the us and were generally utilized to support liquidity needs in our foreign operations we intend to continue to permanently reinvest the cash held outside of the us in our foreign operations  for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 our aftertax return on invested capital roic was 313 as compared to 312 for the comparable prior year period roic is calculated as aftertax operating profit excluding rent charges divided by invested capital which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases we use roic to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance refer to the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation  debt facilities  on december 19 2014 we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility the multiyear credit agreement by increasing the amount of capital leases allowable to 225 million extending the expiration date by two years and renegotiating other terms and conditions this credit facility is available to primarily support commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and other shortterm unsecured bank loans the capacity of the credit facility

as defined in the revolving credit facility depending upon our senior unsecured noncredit enhanced longterm debt rating interest accrues on base rate loans as defined in the credit facility the original expiration date of the credit facility was december 19 2015 but in accordance with the credit agreement in november 2015 we requested and the banks approved the extension of the termination date to december 16 2016 in addition at least 15 days prior to december 16 2016 we have the right to convert the credit facility to a term loan for up to one year from the termination date subject to a 1 penalty  as of august 27 2016 we had no outstanding borrowings under either of the revolving credit facilities and 33 million of outstanding letters of credit under the multiyear credit agreement  the revolving credit facility agreements require that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 251 this ratio is defined as the ratio of i consolidated earnings before interest taxes and rents to ii consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of august 27 2016 was 551  as of august 27 2016 1198 billion of commercial paper borrowings and the 400 million 1300 notes due january 2017 are classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as we have the ability and intent to refinance on a longterm basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facilities as of august 27 2016 we had 1708 billion of availability under our 175 billion revolving credit facilities which would allow us to replace these shortterm obligations with longterm financing facilities  we also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of 100 million the letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the multiyear credit agreement in fiscal 2016 we amended our existing letter of credit facility to decrease the amount that can be requested in letters of credit from 100 million to 75 million effective june 2016 this amendment also extended the maturity date from june 2016 to june 2019 as of august 27 2016 we had 749 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility  in addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facilities discussed above we had 279 million in letters of credit outstanding as of august 27 2016 these letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis  on april 21 2016 we issued 400 million in 3125 senior notes due april 2026 and 250 million in 1625 senior notes due april 2019 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 15 2015 the 2015 shelf registration the 2015 shelf registration allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes including repaying redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital capital expenditures new location openings stock repurchases and acquisitions proceeds from the debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes  on april 29 2015 we issued 400 million in 3250 senior notes due april 2025 and 250 million in 2500 senior notes due april 2021 under the 2015 shelf registration proceeds from the debt issuances were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings which were used to repay the 500 million in 5750 senior notes due in january 2015 and for general corporate purposes  on january 14 2014 we issued 400 million in 1300 senior notes due january 2017 under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on april 17 2012 proceeds from the debt issuance on january 14 2014 were used to repay a portion of the 500 million in 6500 senior notes due january 2014 we used commercial paper borrowings to repay the remainder of the 6500 senior notes    28    table of contents the 5750 senior notes issued in july 2009 and the 7125 senior notes issued during august 2008 collectively the notes are subject to an interest rate adjustment if the debt ratings assigned to the notes are downgraded further all senior notes contain a provision that repayment of the notes may be accelerated if we experience a change in control as defined in the agreements our borrowings under our senior notes contain minimal covenants primarily restrictions on liens under our revolving credit facilities covenants include limitations on total indebtedness restrictions on liens a maximum debt to earnings ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances these covenants are in addition to the consolidated interest coverage ratio discussed above all of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs  as of august 27 2016 we were in compliance with all covenants related to our borrowing arrangements and expect to remain in compliance with those covenants in the future  for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 our adjusted debt to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense ebitdar ratio was 251 as compared to 251 as of the comparable prior year end we calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt capital lease obligations and rent times six and we calculate ebitdar by adding interest taxes depreciation amortization rent and sharebased compensation expense to net income we target our debt levels to a ratio of adjusted debt to ebitdar in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings we believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels refer to the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures section for further details of our calculation  stock repurchases  during 1998 we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our board of directors the board on march 22 2016 the board voted to increase the authorization by 750 million to raise the cumulative share repurchase authorization from 164 billion to 1715 billion

financial statements for a discussion on recent accounting pronouncements  critical accounting policies and estimates  preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the audit committee of our board the following items in our consolidated financial statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management  inventory reserves and cost of sales  lifo  we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market inventory cost has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method for domestic inventories and the weighted average cost method for mexico and brazil inventories due to price deflation on our merchandise purchases we have exhausted our lifo reserve balance our policy is not to write up inventory in excess of replacement cost which is based on average cost the difference between lifo cost and replacement cost which will be reduced upon experiencing price inflation on our merchandise purchases was 3641 million at august 27 2016    33    table of contents inventory obsolescence and shrinkage  our inventory primarily hard parts maintenance items accessories and nonautomotive products is used on vehicles that have rather long lives and therefore the risk of obsolescence is minimal and the majority of excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit in the isolated instances where less than full credit will be received for such returns and where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded costs we record a charge less than 3 million in each of the last three years through cost of sales for the difference these charges are based on managements judgment including estimates and assumptions regarding marketability of products and the market value of inventory to be sold in future periods  historically we have not encountered material exposure to inventory obsolescence or excess inventory nor have we experienced material changes to our estimates however we may be exposed to material losses should our vendors alter their policy with regard to accepting excess inventory returns  additionally we reduce inventory for projected losses related to shrinkage which is estimated based on historical losses and current inventory loss trends resulting from previous physical inventories shrinkage may occur due to theft loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of goods among other things throughout the year we take physical inventory counts of our stores and distribution centers to verify these estimates we make assumptions regarding upcoming physical inventory counts that may differ from actual results  each quarter we evaluate the accrued shrinkage in light of the actual shrink results from physical inventory counts to the extent our actual physical inventory count results differ from our estimates we may experience material adjustments to our financial statements historically we have not experienced material adjustments to our shrinkage estimates and do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use over the last three years there has been less than a 50 basis point fluctuation in our shrinkage rate shrink loss as a percent of sales  a 10 difference in our inventory reserves as of august 27 2016 would have affected net income by approximately 62 million in fiscal 2016  vendor allowances  we receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements including allowances for warranties advertising and general promotion of vendor products vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of inventory unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific incremental identifiable costs incurred by the company in selling the vendors products approximately 87 of the vendor funds received are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold  based on our vendor agreements a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory therefore we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory during the year we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations we generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and have legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them historically we have had writeoffs less than 150 thousand in each of the last three years  goodwill and intangibles  we evaluate goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values exceed the current fair values we evaluate the likelihood of impairment by considering qualitative factors such as macroeconomic industry market or any other factors that could impact the reporting units fair value if these factors indicate impairment we perform a quantitative assessment to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level and involves valuation methods including forecasting future financial performance estimates of discount rates and other factors if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the fair value we recognize an impairment loss    34    table of contents indefinitelived intangibles are evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future discounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate if the carrying value of the indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds the fair value based on the future discounted cash flows we recognize an impairment loss these impairment analyses require a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual results may be different from our estimates  the carrying value of goodwill at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 was 3919 million no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014  selfinsurance reserves  we retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers compensation employee health general and products liability property and vehicle liability and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks our selfinsurance reserve estimates totaled 2144 million at august 27 2016 and 2053 million at august 29 2015 this change is primarily reflective of our growing operations including inflation increases in health care costs the number of vehicles and the number of hours worked as well as our historical claims experience  the assumptions made by management in estimating our selfinsurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels we utilize various methods including analyses of historical trends and actuarial methods to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported the actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date when estimating these liabilities we consider factors such as the severity duration and frequency of claims legal costs associated with claims healthcare trends and projected inflation of related factors in recent history our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates as we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred we will adjust our reserves accordingly  management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks arriving at these estimates however requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates for example changes in our assumptions about health care costs the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary materially from our assumptions and estimates causing our reserves to be overstated or understated for instance a 10 change in our selfinsurance liability would have affected net income by approximately 139 million for fiscal 2016  our liabilities for workers compensation certain general and product liability property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities however the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities accordingly we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be longterm using the riskfree interest rate as of the balance sheet date if the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 50 basis points net income would have been affected by approximately 21 million for fiscal 2016 our liability for health benefits is classified as current as the historical average duration of claims is approximately six weeks  income taxes  our income tax returns are audited by state federal and foreign tax authorities and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate the contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits changes in tax laws litigation appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions we regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded as of august 27 2016 we had approximately 258 million reserved for uncertain tax positions  we evaluate potential exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a twostep process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes if any the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50 likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement    35    table of contents we believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years however actual results could differ from our estimates and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material specifically management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions additionally to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or must pay in excess of recognized reserves our effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected  pension obligation  prior to january 1 2003 substantially all fulltime employees were covered by a qualified defined benefit pension plan the benefits under the plan were based on years of service and the employees highest consecutive fiveyear average compensation on january 1 2003 the plan was frozen accordingly pension plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan on january 1 2003 our supplemental unqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees was also frozen accordingly plan participants will earn no new benefits under the plan formula and no new participants will join the pension plan as the plan benefits are frozen the annual pension expense and recorded liabilities are not impacted by increases in future compensation levels but are impacted by the use of two key assumptions in the calculation of these balances  expected longterm rate of return on plan assets for the fiscal year ended august 27 2016 we have assumed a 70 longterm rate of return on our plan assets this estimate is a judgmental matter in which management considers the composition of our asset portfolio our historical longterm investment performance and current market conditions we review the expected longterm rate of return on an annual basis and revise it accordingly additionally we monitor the mix of investments in our portfolio to ensure alignment with our longterm strategy to manage pension cost and reduce volatility in our assets in august 2014 our investment committee approved a revised asset allocation target for the investments held by the pension plan based on the revised asset allocation target the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets changed from 75 for the year ended august 30 2014 to 70 for the years ending august 29 2015 and august 27 2016 at august 27 2016 our plan assets totaled 2894 million in our qualified plan our assets are generally valued using the net asset values which are determined by valuing investments at the closing price or last trade reported on such date on the major market on which the individual securities are traded we have no assets in our nonqualified plan a 50 basis point change in our expected long term rate of return would impact annual pension expense by approximately 14 million for the qualified plan  discount rate used to determine benefit obligations this rate is highly sensitive and is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for longterm highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date using yields for maturities that are in line with the duration of our pension liabilities for fiscal 2016 we assumed a discount rate of 37 a decrease in the discount rate increases our projected benefit obligation and pension expense a 50 basis point change in the discount rate at august 27 2016 would impact annual pension expenseincome by approximately 18 million for the qualified plan and 24 thousand for the nonqualified plan    36    table of contents
