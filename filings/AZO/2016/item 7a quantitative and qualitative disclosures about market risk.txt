  we are exposed to market risk from among other things changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates and fuel prices from time to time we use various derivative instruments to reduce interest rate and fuel price risks to date based upon our current level of foreign operations no derivative instruments have been utilized to reduce foreign exchange rate risk all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by the board further we do not buy or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes  interest rate risk  our financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates at times we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts treasury lock agreements and forwardstarting interest rate swaps  we have historically utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to lock in fixed rates on future debt issuances we reflect the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments as a component of either other current assets or accrued expenses and other our interest rate hedge instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  unrealized gains and losses on interest rate hedges are deferred in stockholders deficit as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as a decrease or increase to interest expense in the period in which the related cash flows being hedged are recognized in expense however to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the cash flow being hedged that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings  the fair value of our debt was estimated at 5117 billion as of august 27 2016 and 4696 billion as of august 29 2015 based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to us for debt having the same remaining maturities such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt by 1927 million and 707 million at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 respectively we had 1198 billion of variable rate debt outstanding at august 27 2016 and 1048 million of variable rate debt outstanding at august 29 2015 in fiscal 2016 at this borrowing level for variable rate debt a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on our pretax earnings and cash flows of approximately 120 million the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor we had outstanding debt of 3727 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 234 million at august 27 2016 and 3577 billion net of unamortized debt issuance costs of 227 million at august 29 2015 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately 1789 million at august 27 2016  fuel price risk  from time to time we utilize fuel swap contracts in order to lower fuel cost volatility in our operating results historically the instruments were executed to economically hedge a portion of our diesel and unleaded fuel exposure however we have not designated the fuel swap contracts as hedging instruments and therefore the contracts have not qualified for hedge accounting treatment in fiscal 2015 we entered into a fuel swap to economically hedge the commodity cost associated with our unleaded fuel usage the notional amount of the contract was 29 million gallons and terminated march 31 2015 the swap had no significant impact on the results of operations we did not enter into any fuel swap contracts during fiscal 2016 or 2014  foreign currency risk  foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities functional currencies to minimize our risk we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies we are exposed to brazilian reals canadian dollars euros chinese yuan renminbi and british pounds but our primary foreign currency exposure arises from mexican pesodenominated revenues and profits and their translation into us dollars foreign currency exposures arising from transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are not material    37    table of contents we view our investments in mexican subsidiaries as longterm as a result we generally do not hedge these net investments the net asset exposure in the mexican subsidiaries translated into us dollars using the yearend exchange rates was 3980 million at august 27 2016 and 3667 million at august 29 2015 the yearend exchange rates with respect to the mexican peso decreased by approximately 9 against the us dollar during fiscal 2016 and decreased by approximately 29 during fiscal 2015 the potential loss in value of our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries resulting from a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at august 27 2016 and august 29 2015 would be approximately 362 million and approximately 333 million respectively any changes in our net assets in the mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive loss unless the mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed  a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in average exchange rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations    38    table of contents
