  our business is subject to a variety of risks set forth below are certain of the important risks that we face the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business these risks are not the only ones we face our business could also be affected by additional factors that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial to our business  if demand for our products slows then our business may be materially adversely affected  demand for the products we sell may be affected by a number of factors we cannot control including           the number and age of vehicles in current service more vehicles on the road lead to more maintenance and repairs and vehicles seven years old or older are generally no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranties and tend to need more maintenance and repair than newer vehicles           rising energy prices increases in energy prices may cause our customers to defer purchases of certain of our products as they use a higher percentage of their income to pay for gasoline and other energy costs and may drive their vehicles less resulting in less wear and tear and lower demand for repairs and maintenance    12    table of contents        the economy in periods of declining economic conditions both retail and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repairs additionally such conditions may affect our customers ability to obtain credit during periods of expansionary economic conditions more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles           the weather mild weather conditions may lower the failure rates of automotive parts while wet conditions may cause our customers to defer maintenance and repair on their vehicles extremely hot or cold conditions may enhance demand for our products due to increased failure rates of our customers automotive parts           technological advances advances in automotive technology and parts design can result in cars needing maintenance less frequently and parts lasting longer  for the long term demand for our products may be affected by           the number of miles vehicles are driven annually higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors           the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranties or maintenance offered on new vehicles           restrictions on access to telematics and diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation which may cause vehicle owners to rely on dealers to perform maintenance and repairs  all of these factors could result in immediate and longer term declines in the demand for our products which could adversely affect our sales cash flows and overall financial condition  if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline  the sale of automotive parts accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive and sales volumes are dependent on many factors including name recognition product availability customer service store location and price competitors are opening locations near our existing locations autozone competes as a provider in both the diy and difm auto parts and accessories markets  our competitors include national regional and local auto parts chains independently owned parts stores online parts stores wholesale distributors jobbers repair shops car washes and auto dealers in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores hardware stores supermarkets drugstores convenience stores home stores and other online retailers that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies chemicals accessories tools and maintenance parts although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners merchandise quality selection and availability product warranty store layout location and convenience price and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some of our competitors may gain competitive advantages such as greater financial and marketing resources allowing them to sell automotive products at lower prices larger stores with more merchandise longer operating histories more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising with the increasing use of digital tools and social media and our competitors increased focus on optimizing customers online experience our customers are quickly able to compare prices product assortment and feedback from other customers before purchasing our products either online in the physical stores or through a combination of both offerings if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies or if our competitors develop more effective strategies we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline    13    table of contents we may not be able to sustain our historic rate of sales growth  we have increased our location count in the past five fiscal years growing from 4813 locations at august 27 2011 to 5814 locations at august 27 2016 an average location increase per year of 4 additionally we have increased annual revenues in the past five fiscal years from 8073 billion in fiscal 2011 to 10636 billion in fiscal 2016 an average increase per year of 6 annual revenue growth is driven by the opening of new locations and commercial programs and increases in same store sales we open new locations only after evaluating customer buying trends and market demandneeds all of which could be adversely affected by persistent unemployment wage cuts small business failures and microeconomic conditions unique to the automotive industry same store sales are impacted both by customer demand levels and by the prices we are able to charge for our products which can also be negatively impacted by the economic pressures mentioned above we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to open locations at historical rates or continue to achieve increases in same store sales  consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business  recently some of our competitors have merged consolidation among our competitors could enhance their market share and financial position provide them with the ability to achieve better purchasing terms and provide more competitive prices to customers for whom we compete and allow them to utilize merger synergies and cost savings to increase advertising and marketing budgets to more effectively compete for customers consolidation by our competitors could also increase their access to local market parts assortment these consolidated competitors could take sales volume away from us in certain markets could cause us to change our pricing with a negative impact on our margins or could cause us to spend more money to maintain customers or seek new customers all of which could negatively impact our business  if we cannot profitably increase our market share in the commercial auto parts business our sales growth may be limited  although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial market we must effectively compete against national and regional auto parts chains independently owned parts stores wholesalers and jobbers in order to increase our commercial market share although we believe we compete effectively in the commercial market on the basis of customer service merchandise quality selection and availability price product warranty distribution locations and the strength of our autozone brand name trademarks and service marks some automotive aftermarket chains have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have and as a result have developed longterm customer relationships and have large available inventories if we are unable to profitably develop new commercial customers our sales growth may be limited  a downgrade in our credit ratings or a general disruption in the credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds refinance our debt obtain new funding or issue securities  our shortterm and longterm debt is rated investment grade by the major rating agencies these investmentgrade credit ratings have historically allowed us to take advantage of lower interest rates and other favorable terms on our shortterm credit lines in our senior debt offerings and in the commercial paper markets to maintain our investmentgrade ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios a change by the rating agencies in these ratios an increase in our debt andor a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit facilities to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely significantly increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings  moreover significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and availability of credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms during brief time intervals in recent years there was limited liquidity in the commercial paper markets resulting in an absence of commercial paper buyers and extraordinarily high interest rates on commercial paper we can provide no assurance that credit market events such as those that occurred in recent years will not occur again in the foreseeable future conditions and events in the global credit markets could have a material adverse effect on our access to shortterm debt and the terms and cost of that debt    14    table of contents significant changes in macroeconomic and geopolitical factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  macroeconomic conditions impact both our customers and our suppliers job growth in the united states has remained relatively slow during the past five years however towards the end of fiscal 2015 and continuing through fiscal 2016 the unemployment rate has improved to prerecession levels moreover the united states government continues to operate under historically large deficits and debt burden continued distress in global credit markets business failures significant geopolitical conflicts continued volatility in energy prices and other factors continue to affect the global economy moreover rising energy prices could impact our merchandise distribution commercial delivery utility and product costs over the short term such factors could positively impact our business over a longer period of time all of these macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions could adversely affect our sales growth margins and overhead which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations  our business depends upon hiring and retaining qualified employees  we believe that much of our brand value lies in the quality of the more than 84000 autozoners employed in our stores distribution centers store support centers alldata autoanything and imc our workforce costs represent our largest operating expense and our business is subject to employment laws and regulations including requirements related to minimum wage we cannot be assured that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates if we are unable to hire properly train andor retain qualified employees we could experience higher employment costs reduced sales losses of customers and diminution of our brand which could adversely affect our earnings if we do not maintain competitive wages our customer service could suffer due to a declining quality of our workforce or alternatively our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates a violation or change in employment laws andor regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  inability to acquire and provide quality merchandise at competitive prices could adversely affect our sales and results of operations  we are dependent upon our domestic and international vendors continuing to supply us with quality merchandise at favorable prices and payment terms if our merchandise offerings do not meet our customers expectations regarding quality and safety we could experience lost sales increased costs and exposure to legal and reputational risk all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety and quality standards events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities to the extent our suppliers are subject to added government regulation of their product design andor manufacturing processes the cost of the merchandise we purchase may rise in addition negative customer perceptions regarding the safety or quality of the products we sell could cause our customers to seek alternative sources for their needs resulting in lost sales in those circumstances it may be difficult and costly for us to rebuild our reputation and regain the confidence of our customers moreover our vendors are impacted by global economic conditions credit market and other macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our suppliers to finance and operate their businesses resulting in increased product costs and difficulties in meeting our inventory demands if any of our significant vendors experience financial difficulties or otherwise are unable to deliver merchandise to us on a timely basis or at all we could have product shortages in our stores that could adversely affect customers perceptions of us and cause us to lose customers and sales  we directly imported approximately 10 of our purchases measured at cost in fiscal 2016 but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason such as political unrest or acts of war currency fluctuations disruptions in maritime lanes port labor disputes and economic conditions and instability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located the financial instability of suppliers suppliers failure to meet our standards issues with labor practices of our suppliers or labor problems they may experience such as strikes stoppages or slowdowns which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption the availability and cost of raw materials to suppliers increased import duties merchandise quality or safety issues transport availability and    15    table of contents  cost increases in wage rates and taxes transport security inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability in addition the united states foreign trade policies tariffs and other impositions on imported goods trade sanctions imposed on certain countries the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade and port labor agreements are beyond our control these and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our business and financial performance as we increase our imports of merchandise from foreign vendors the risks associated with these imports also will increase  our ability to grow depends in part on new location openings existing location remodels and expansions and effective utilization of our existing supply chain and hub network  our continued growth and success will depend in part on our ability to open and operate new locations and expand and remodel existing locations to meet customers needs on a timely and profitable basis accomplishing our new and existing location expansion goals will depend upon a number of factors including the ability to partner with developers and landlords to obtain suitable sites for new and expanded locations at acceptable costs the hiring and training of qualified personnel particularly at the location management level and the integration of new locations into existing operations there can be no assurance we will be able to achieve our location expansion goals manage our growth effectively successfully integrate the planned new locations into our operations or operate our new remodeled and expanded locations profitably  in addition we extensively utilize our hub network our supply chain and logistics management techniques to efficiently stock our locations we have made and plan to continue to make significant investments in our supply chain to improve our ability to provide the best parts at the right price if we fail to effectively utilize our existing hubs andor supply chains or if our investments in our supply chain and global sourcing initiative do not provide the anticipated benefits we could experience suboptimal inventory levels in our locations or increase our costs which could adversely affect our sales volume andor our margins  our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our brand name and profitability  we believe our continued strong sales growth is driven in significant part by our brand name the value in our brand name and its continued effectiveness in driving our sales growth are dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our reputation for safety high product quality friendliness service trustworthy advice integrity and business ethics any negative publicity about these areas could damage our reputation and may result in reduced demand for our merchandise the increasing use of technology also poses a risk as customers are able to quickly compare products and prices and use social media to provide feedback in a manner that is rapidly and broadly dispersed our reputation could be impacted if a customer has a bad experience and shares it over social media  failure to comply with ethical social product labor environmental and anticorruption standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse actions by consumer or environmental groups employees or regulatory bodies failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations to maintain an effective system of internal controls or to provide accurate and timely financial statement information could also hurt our reputation if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions while incurring substantial legal fees and costs in addition our capital and operating expenses could increase due to implementation of and compliance with existing and future laws and regulations or remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations the inability to pass through any increased expenses through higher prices would have an adverse effect on our results of operations  damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation    16    table of contents our success in international operations is dependent on our ability to manage the unique challenges presented by international markets  the various risks we face in our us operations generally also exist when conducting operations in and sourcing products and materials from outside of the us as well as unique costs and difficulties of managing international operations our expansion into international markets may be adversely affected by local laws and customs us laws applicable to foreign operations and political and economic conditions risks inherent in international operations also include potential adverse tax consequences compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and local antibribery law greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights challenges to identify and gain access to local suppliers and possibly misjudging the response of consumers in foreign countries to our product assortment and marketing strategy  in addition our operations in international markets are conducted primarily in the local currency of those countries since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars amounts of assets liabilities net sales and other revenues and expenses denominated in local currencies must be translated into us dollars using exchange rates for the current period as a result foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may adversely impact our financial performance  failure to protect the privacy and security of customers suppliers autozoners or company information could damage our reputation subject us to litigation and cause us to incur substantial costs  our business like that of most retailers and distributors involves the receipt storage and transmission of personal information about our customers suppliers and autozoners some of which is entrusted to thirdparty service providers and vendors failure to protect the security of our customers suppliers employees and company information could subject us to costly regulatory enforcement actions expose us to litigation and impair our reputation which may have a negative impact on our sales while we and our thirdparty service providers and vendors take significant steps to protect customer supplier employee and other confidential information including maintaining compliance with payment card industry standards these security measures may be breached in the future due to cyberattack employee error fraud trickery hacking or other intentional or unintentional acts and unauthorized parties may obtain access to this data the methods used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect for long periods of time as the regulatory environment related to information security data collection and use and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous compliance with these requirements could also result in additional costs  we rely heavily on our information technology systems for our key business processes any failure or interruption in these systems could have a material adverse impact on our business  we rely extensively on our information technology systems some of which are managed or provided by thirdparty service providers to manage inventory process transactions and summarize results our systems and the thirdparty systems we rely on are subject to damage or interruption from power outages telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches catastrophic events and design or usage errors by our autozoners contractors or thirdparty service providers although we and our thirdparty service providers work diligently to maintain our respective systems we may not be successful in doing so if our systems are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them and may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions which could result in lost sales inability to process purchase orders andor a potential loss of customer loyalty which could adversely affect our results of operations  business interruptions may negatively impact our location hours operability of our computer and other systems availability of merchandise and otherwise have a material negative effect on our sales and our business  war or acts of terrorism political unrest hurricanes windstorms fires earthquakes floods and other natural or other disasters or the threat of any of them may result in certain of our locations being closed for a period of time or permanently or have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our locations some of our merchandise is imported from other countries if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected    17    table of contents in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and locations resulting in lost sales andor a potential loss of customer loyalty transportation issues could also cause us to cancel purchase orders if we are unable to receive merchandise in our distribution centers
