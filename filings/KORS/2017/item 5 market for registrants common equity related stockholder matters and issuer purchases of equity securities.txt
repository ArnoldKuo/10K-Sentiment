taken together our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image4table of contentsindustrywe operate in the global luxury goods industry over the past ten years the luxury goods industry has grown and has remained resilient during economic downturns however the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has recently been challenged by a number of factors including lower consumer traffic trends a promotional selling environment lower tourist travel currency effects restrained consumer spending and a shift in spending from personal luxury goods to luxury experiences as a result while accessories have remained the biggest personal luxury goods category the level of growth within this category while still positive has decelerated from prior years in addition the consumer demand within the luxury watch and luxury apparel categories has experienced a decline while the wholesale channel has been challenged the retail channel has continued to grow largely driven by the rapid growth of the ecommerce channel and increased offprice sales which has continued to cannibalize brick and mortar retail store sales as the overall environment has become increasingly omnichannel increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences have become the key ingredients to winning market share we believe that our innovative product offerings and customer engagement initiatives make us well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories product category as it is one of our primary product categories of focus as well as to grow our sales in other product categoriesgeographic informationwe generate revenue globally through our three segments through our retail and

and fashion trends in the design styling production merchandising and pricing of products if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences consumers may consider our brand image to

actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as

subject to taxation in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction as a result our overall effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of earnings from the various tax jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any time there are multiple tax years that are subject to examinations by various taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a

liabilitieswe face risks associated with operating in international markets and our strategy to continue to expand internationallywe operate on a global basis with approximately 343 of our total revenue from operations outside of the us during fiscal 2017 as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including political and economic instability in foreign countries laws regulations and policies of foreign governments potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies political or civil unrest acts of terrorism military actions or other conditions economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations we also sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins depending on geographic region due to a variety of factors including product mix store size occupancy costs labor costs and retail pricing changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues increased costs and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition15table of contentsthere are some countries where we do not yet have significant operating experience and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations many countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate including lease terms and local reporting or legal requirements furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in addition in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionin addition on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union brexit the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk from the european union eu may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere negotiations on withdrawal and postexit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the proposed withdrawal could adversely affect the tax currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu and significantly disrupt trade between the uk

interest in our joint venture in latin america mk panama and consolidate this joint venture into our operations we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment and our joint venture also exposes us to risks to the extent that our joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take actions contrary to our policies or objectives experience financial or other difficulties or be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreement any of which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition16table of contentsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenuea small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 210 of our total revenue for fiscal 2017 and 258 of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 our largest wholesale customer macys accounted for 89 of our total revenue for fiscal 2017 and 127 of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an orderbyorder basis a decision by any of our major wholesale customers whether motivated by marketing strategy competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability during the past several years the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes will continue in addition store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products andor may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionour business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsour results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars during financial statement consolidation if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations in addition we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our nonus subsidiaries which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity as a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note we continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates however we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsas a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound the chinese yuan renminbi the japanese yen the korean won and the canadian dollar among others a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased priceswe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under longterm noncancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease we also may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms we do not own any of our store facilities instead we lease all of our stores under operating leases our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years generally require a fixed annual rent and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount certain of our european stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs for example as of april 1 2017 we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to 1093 billion through fiscal 2022 and approximately 5493 million thereafter through fiscal 2035 we recently announced that we intend to optimize our retail store fleet including through the closure of between 100 and 125 of fullprice underperforming retail stores in connection with this retail fleet optimization we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation provisions in our leases in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our substantial operating lease obligations including with respect to closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition17table of contentsour business may be negatively impacted due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our productswe are subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including competition a highly promotional selling environment and changes in consumer spending patterns if we fail to anticipate identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess and slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin and profitabilityour share price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performanceour business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of total revenue earnings per share comparable store sales and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our share price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our share pricewe periodically

our securities could be adversely affected if our share repurchase activity differs from investors expectations or if our share repurchase program were to terminateour current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited controlwe have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell under our trademarks products requiring specialized expertise we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas such as the middle east eastern europe brazil certain parts of asia and australia in addition we have a joint venture that covers the distribution and sale of products and the operation of retail stores in latin america excluding brazil and the caribbean in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners such arrangements may not be successful our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own such as the timing of new store openings the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products in

competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangementswe rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through among other things approval rights over store location and design product design production quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and

provisions of our memorandum and articlesthese provisions of our memorandum and articles could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares21table of contentsrights of shareholders under british virgin islands law differ from those under united states law and accordingly our shareholders may have fewer protectionsour corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles the bvi business companies act 2004 as amended the bvi act and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands and by the bvi act the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law as a result of the foregoing holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a us companythe laws of the british virgin islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairsunder the laws of the british virgin islands there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the bvi act dealing with shareholder remedies the principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a british virgin islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the bvi act and the memorandum and articles of association of the company as such if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the bvi act or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association then the courts will likely grant relief generally the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following i an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority ii acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company iii acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders such as the right to vote and iv acts where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the united statesit may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the united statesunder our memorandum and articles we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them subject to limited exceptions furthermore to the extent allowed by law the rights and obligations among or between us any of our current or former directors officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the british virgin islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the british virgin islands courts unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such although there is doubt as to whether united states courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the united states under united states securities laws these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the british virgin islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the british virgin islands or jurisdictions that would apply british virgin islands lawbritish virgin islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interestsbritish virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a british virgin islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred the british virgin islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of united states securities law or to impose liabilities in original actions brought in the british virgin islands based on certain liability provisions of the united states securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce the nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered22table
