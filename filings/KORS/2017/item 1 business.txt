our brands established fashion authority and the expanding mens market taken together our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image4table of contentsindustrywe operate in the global luxury goods industry over the past ten years the luxury goods industry has grown and has remained resilient during economic downturns however the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has recently been challenged by a number of factors including lower consumer traffic trends a promotional selling environment lower tourist travel currency effects restrained consumer spending and a shift in spending from personal luxury goods to luxury experiences as a result while accessories have remained the biggest personal luxury goods category the level of growth within this category while still positive has decelerated from prior years in addition the consumer demand within the luxury watch and luxury apparel categories has experienced a decline while the wholesale channel has been challenged the retail channel has continued to grow largely driven by the rapid growth of the ecommerce channel and increased offprice sales which has continued to cannibalize brick and mortar retail store sales as the overall environment has become increasingly omnichannel increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences have become the key ingredients to winning market share we believe that our innovative product offerings and customer engagement initiatives make us well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories product category as it is one of our primary product categories of focus as well as to grow our sales in other product categoriesgeographic

beauty and luxottica group luxottica for eyewear among others while total revenue for licensed products declined from 1733 million in fiscal 2016 to 1458 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to declines related to watch and jewelry product categories and lower geographic licensing revenues due to our acquisitions of the previously licensed operations in greater china and south korea we have
