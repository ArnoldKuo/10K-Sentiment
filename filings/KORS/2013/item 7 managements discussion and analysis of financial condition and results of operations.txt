words as may expect anticipate estimate seek intend believe or similar words concerning future events the forwardlooking statements contained herein include without limitation statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration gross profit margins selling and marketing expenses capital expenditures general and administrative expenses capital resources new stores additional financings or borrowings and additional losses and are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements we also urge you to carefully review the risk factors set forth in item 1a  risk factors  overview  our business  we are a rapidly growing global luxury lifestyle brand led by a worldclass management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand over 30 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence over 85 countries as a highly recognized luxury lifestyle brand in north america with accelerating awareness in targeted international markets we have experienced exceptional sales momentum and intend to continue along this course as we grow our business we have also expanded our distribution capabilities beyond wholesale into retail which account for a major portion of our total revenue  we operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of march 30 2013 our retail segment included 231 north american retail stores including concessions and 73 international retail stores including concessions in europe and japan as of march 30 2013 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 2215 department store and specialty store doors in north america and wholesale sales through approximately 1034 department store and specialty store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rights during fiscal 2013 our licensing segment accounted for approximately 40 of our total revenue and consisted primarily of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses  we offer two primary collections the michael kors luxury collection and the michael michael kors accessible luxury collection the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced the michael michael kors collection which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods taken together our two collections target a broad customer base while retaining a premium luxury image  trends and uncertainties  broaden distribution capabilities beyond wholesale into retail over the years we have successfully broadened our distribution capabilities beyond wholesale into retail and we believe that this trend will continue as our retail store network grows at a faster rate than wholesale we believe that retail allows greater control over the shopping environment merchandise selection and many other aspects of the shopping experience that attracts and retains loyal customers and increases sales  establishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets we have yet to establish a substantial presence  costs of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our products    22    table of contents demand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences currently demand for our products is predicted to grow according to the altagamma studies demand for the worldwide luxury goods industry is predicted to grow from approximately 2515 billion in 2011 to between 3144 billion and 3275 billion in 2015 the accessories product category represented 27 of total sales for the worldwide luxury goods industry in 2010 and was the fastest growing product category between 2005 and 2011 growing at a compound annual rate of 99 we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the accessories product category as it is one of our primary product category focuses  critical accounting policies  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements our most critical accounting policies discussed below pertain to revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation and income taxes in applying such policies we must use some amounts that are based upon our informed judgments and best estimates estimates by their nature are based upon judgments and available information the estimates that we make are based upon historical factors current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis  revenue recognition  we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual returns and by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 31 million 17 million and 23 million at march 30 2013 march 31 2012 and april 2 2011 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks as well as for certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 430 million 304 million and 252 million at march 30 2013 march 31 2012 and april 2 2011 respectively  royalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our trademarks at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales by licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our trademarks to sell our branded products in certain geographic regions  longlived assets  all longlived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization or depreciation for the purposes of impairment testing the group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease and our shopinshops are amortized over a three year period we evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows for fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we recorded charges for impairments on fixed assets and intangible assets related to our retail segment of 07 33 million and 38 million respectively  goodwill  on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale and licensing segments which are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill is impaired prior to    23    table of contents  fiscal 2012 we performed our impairment testing for goodwill using the fair value approach employing both the discounted cash flow method and market multiples method to determine the fair value of our reporting units step one these methods utilized both our historical results and projected future results during fiscal 2012 we adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to goodwill impairment analysis which allows entities to initially perform a qualitative analysis step zero of the fair value of its reporting units to determine whether it is necessary to undertake a quantitative two step goodwill analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of all reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values  we will continue to perform this initial qualitative analysis in future years should the results of this assessment result in either ambiguous or unfavorable conclusion we will perform additional quantitative testing consistent with the fair value approach mentioned above the valuation methods used in the fair value approach discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require our management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations  we have assessed our goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter for the periods presented there are no impairment charges related to goodwill for any of the fiscal periods presented  sharebased compensation  we grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors these awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model and are recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on attainment of certain vesting requirements as well as our completion of an initial public offering determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term and riskfree rate  our expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for a performance based option is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased vesting options is based on the simplified method using the vesting term of generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in a holding periods ranging from 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys holding period as prior to december 2011 there was no historical option exercise experience due to the company being privately held the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve the period of which relates to the grants holding period if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the past  expense related to equity compensation during fiscal 2013 and 2012 was approximately 209 million and 270 million respectively there was no expense related to equity compensation for periods prior to fiscal 2012 as all of our equity grants were not exercisable due to an initial public offering ipo being one of the vesting requirements the weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted during fiscal 2013 fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 was 2066 801 and 308 respectively  derivative financial instruments  we use forward currency exchange contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of the functional currency relative to the local currency of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 18 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes while the balance of these contracts are undesignated accordingly the changes in the fair value of those contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are at the balance sheet date and upon maturity settlement recorded in our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were established regarding those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the same manner as those contracts charged to earnings above in the period the ineffectiveness was determined    24    table of contents for fiscal 2013 the company recorded a gain of 14 million relating to these contracts as a component of operations for fiscal years ended 2012 and 2011 respectively amounts representing a gain of 26 million and a loss of 25 million were charged to operations the following table details the fair value of these contracts as of march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 in thousands                    march 302013     march 312012     prepaid expenses and other current assets    1367      1318     accrued expenses and other current liabilities    71      276    income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments  realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable  we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense  recent accounting pronouncements  we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and other than the recent pronouncement discussed below have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows based on current information  in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard updated 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 asu 201302 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component the asu is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those periods beginning after december 15 2012 for the twelve months ended march 30 2013 the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income were de minimis    25    table of contents segment information

million or 401 from fiscal 2012 the growth in our comparable store sales was primarily due to an increase in sales of our accessories line and watches during fiscal 2013 in addition our noncomparable store sales were 1891 million during fiscal 2013 which was primarily the result of opening 67 new stores since march 31 2012  wholesale  net sales to our wholesale customers increased 4220 million or 692 to 10321 million for fiscal 2013 compared to 6102 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in our wholesale net sales occurred primarily as a result of increased sales of our accessories line during

sales from our european operations increased approximately 817 during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 due largely to an increase in fullprice doors to 1034 from 650 in the same period last year  licensing  royalties earned on our licensing agreements increased 218 million or 335 to 870 million for fiscal 2013 compared to 652 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in royalties was primarily due

fiscal 2012 gross profit as a percentage of total revenue increased to 599 during fiscal 2013 compared to 578 during fiscal 2012 this increase in gross profit margin in the aggregate was primarily due to a decrease in sales allowances and markdowns as well as experiencing a more favorable product mix during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 this contributed to an increase in gross profit margin in our retail and wholesale segments individually by approximately 220 basis points and 300 basis points respectively the increase in gross profit margin in our retail segment was due primarily to sales of higher margin product as well as a decrease in markdowns given during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the increase in gross profit margin in our wholesale segment resulted largely from a decrease in discounts and allowances given during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  total operating expenses  total operating expenses increased 1711 million or 339 to 6766 million during

fiscal 2013 compared to 4646 million for fiscal 2012 the dollar increase was primarily due to increases in our retail occupancy and salary costs of 1018 million increases in promotional costs which consist of advertising marketing and various promotional costs of 200 million and increases in corporate employeerelated costs of 255 million the increase in our retail occupancy and payroll costs was primarily due to the opening of an additional 67 retail stores during fiscal 2013 advertising costs increased primarily due    29    table of contents  to our expansion into new markets during fiscal

international growth selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 285 during fiscal 2013 compared to 357 for fiscal 2012 the decrease as a percentage of total revenue was primarily due to achieving economies of scale during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as our revenue increased at a greater rate relative to our fixed costs  depreciation and amortization  depreciation and amortization increased 167 million or 446 to 543 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 376 million for fiscal 2012 dollar increases in depreciation and amortization were primarily due to the buildout of 67 new retail locations during this fiscal year new shopinshop locations and investments made in our information systems infrastructure to accommodate our growth

increased 1938 million or 1590 to 3157 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 1219 million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net retail sales for the retail segment increased approximately 103 as a percentage of net retail sales to 297 during fiscal 2013 the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to an approximately 70 decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales as well as to the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales resulted from the increase in our net retail sales during fiscal 2013 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling general and administrative expenses  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale segment increased 1843 million or 2169 to 2693 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 850 million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales for the wholesale segment increased approximately 122 as a percentage of net wholesale sales to 261 this increase was primarily due to an approximately 90 decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of wholesale sales as well as to result of the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net wholesale sales resulted from the increase in our net wholesale sales during fiscal 2013 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling

million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue for the licensing segment decreased approximately 109 as a percentage of revenue to 518 this decrease is primarily the result of an increase in advertising expense during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as we launched several new advertising initiatives including social media and other webbased mediums for increasing brand awareness during the year the increase in advertising expenses was offset in part by the aforementioned increase in sales licensing revenue  interest expense net  interest expense was

loss of 14 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to a foreign currency gain of 26 million during fiscal 2012 the foreign currency loss during fiscal 2013 relative to the foreign currency gain during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen which impacted the remeasurement of yendenominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries conversely during fiscal 2012 there were larger us dollar denominated intercompany loan balances with certain of our nonus subsidiaries whose functional currency was the euro which were impacted by the us dollars strengthening against the euro during that period  provision for income taxes  we recognized 2295 million of income tax expense during fiscal 2013 compared with 1015 million for fiscal 2012 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 366 compared to 408 for fiscal 2012 the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted primarily due to a decrease in our us blended state income tax rate as well as a greater portion of our income being recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain other nondeductible expenses such as fees related to a public offering and income earned in certain nonus entities with significant net operating loss carryforwards in addition factors such as the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods  net income  as a result of the foregoing our net income increased 2502 million or 1698 to 3976 million during fiscal

increased 607 million or 991 to 1219 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 612 million for fiscal 2011 income from operations as a percentage of net retail sales for the retail segment increased approximately 16 as a percentage of net retail sales to 194 during fiscal 2012 the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above in addition to an approximately 06 decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales resulted from the increase in our net retail sales during fiscal 2012 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling general and administrative expenses as well as the charges related to the impairment of longlived assets  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale segment increased 368 million or 762 to 850 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 482 million for fiscal 2011 income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales for the wholesale segment increased approximately 22 as a percentage of net wholesale sales to 139 this increase was primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011  licensing  income from operations for our licensing segment increased 134 million or 488 to 408 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 274 million for fiscal 2011 income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue for the licensing segment increased approximately 25 as a percentage of revenue to 627 this increase is primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in sales of licensed products while our operating expenses remained relatively fixed during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011  interest expense net  interest expense decreased 04 million or 197 to 15 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 19 million for fiscal 2011 the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the decrease in the average balance on our revolving credit facility during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 as well as a decrease in interest rates experienced during the period  foreign currency gain loss  we recognized a foreign currency gain of 26 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to a foreign currency loss of 18 million during fiscal 2011 the gain during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the euro which impacted the remeasurement of intercompany loans with certain of our european subsidiaries which are denominated in us dollars we expect the impact resulting from the remeasurement of these loans to diminish in future periods as certain of these intercompany loans were assumed by subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar and as such are no longer subject to currency remeasurement    34    table of contents provision for income taxes  we recognized 1015 million of income tax expense during fiscal 2012 compared with 607 million for fiscal 2011 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 408 compared to 456 for fiscal 2011 the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted primarily from the following decrease in statutory income tax rates applicable to certain of our nonus subsidiaries and a decrease in our us blended state income tax rate as well as a greater portion of our income being recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 this decrease was offset in part by the impairment charges recognized during fiscal 2012 which yielded no income tax benefits  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain other nondeductible expenses such as fees related to a public offering and income earned in certain nonus entities with significant net operating loss carryforwards in addition factors such as the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods  net income  as a result of the foregoing our net income increased 749 million or 1032 to 1474 million during fiscal 2012 compared to 725 million for fiscal 2011  liquidity and capital resources  liquidity  our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations along with borrowings available under our 2013 credit facility see below discussion regarding senior unsecured revolving credit facility and available cash and cash equivalents our primary use of this liquidity is to fund our ongoing cash requirements including working capital requirements global retail store expansion and renovation construction and renovation of shopinshops investment in information systems infrastructure and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities we believe that the cash generated from our operations together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next 12 months including investments made and expenses incurred in connection with our store growth plans shopin shop growth continued systems development as well as web based sales and marketing initiatives we spent approximately 1213 million on capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 and expect to spend approximately 2300 million on capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 the majority of these expected expenditures relate to new retail store openings planned for the year with the remainder being used for investments in connection with developing new shopinshops buildout of our corporate offices and enhancing our information systems infrastructure in addition we plan to spend approximately 300 million during fiscal 2014 on intangible assets related to our european retail store expansion  the following table sets forth key indicators of our liquidity and

million during fiscal 2013 as compared to 1153 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net income offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease in the change to our accounts receivable was attributable to our increasing sales during fiscal 2013 which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances relative to the prior fiscal year the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily to accommodate the increase to our net sales during fiscal 2013 in addition as we continue to open more retail stores we expect our expenditures on inventory to increase at a greater rate than the increase in our sales as inventory related to retail sales typically experiences slower inventory turnover than that of wholesale  cash provided by operating activities increased 50 million to 1153 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to 1103 million for fiscal 2011 the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net income offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 the decrease in the change to our accounts receivable was largely the result of cash received during fiscal 2011 which was related to sales billed late in our 2010 fiscal year the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily to accommodate the increase to our net sales during fiscal 2012 in addition as we continue to open more retail stores we expect our expenditures on inventory to increase at a greater rate than the increase in our sales as inventory related to retail sales typically experiences slower inventory turnover than that of wholesale  cash used in investing activities  net cash used in investing activities was 1391 million during fiscal 2013 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 882 million during fiscal 2012 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the buildout of our new retail stores which were constructed during the fiscal 2013 shopinshops we installed during fiscal 2013 as well as certain technology initiatives undertaken during the year which related to distribution system enhancements and various other improvements to our infrastructure in addition we purchased approximately 85 million of intangible assets related to certain of our stores opened during fiscal 2013 as well as made an investment in as well as a loan to a joint venture for approximately 32 million and 60 million respectively during fiscal 2013  net cash used in investing activities increased 304 million to 882 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to 578 million during fiscal 2011 the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of the buildout of our new retail stores which were constructed during fiscal 2012 as well as shopinshops we installed during fiscal 2012 as we grow our business in addition we spent approximately 37 million in capital expenditures related to our new distribution facility in california which we began operations in during fiscal 2012  cash provided by used in financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities was 1506 million during fiscal 2013 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 586 million during fiscal 2012 after excluding the noncash effects of tax benefits from the exercise of share options cash provided by operating activities decreased by 203 million this decrease was primarily due to the net repayments on our revolving credit facility of 227 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to net borrowings of 99 during fiscal 2012 this decrease was offset in part by an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee share options during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  net cash provided by financing activities was 586 million during fiscal 2012 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 377 million during fiscal 2011 the 964 million increase in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to the net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of 99 million during fiscal 2012 as compared to net repayments of 312 million made during fiscal 2011 in addition we received net proceeds from the private placement of our convertible preference shares completed in july 2011 of 96
