  we are exposed to certain market risks during the normal course of our business such as risk arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as fluctuations in interest rates in attempts to manage these risks we employ certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure to the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies the use of these instruments helps to manage our exposure to our foreign purchase commitments and better control our product costs other than these purchase commitments we do not use these foreign exchange contracts for any other purposes in addition we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes  foreign currency exchange risk  we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of the functional currency relative to the local currency of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 18 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts currently a relatively small portion are designated as hedges for accounting purposes accordingly the changes in the fair value of the majority of these contracts at the balance sheet date and upon maturity settlement are recorded in our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were established regarding those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the same manner as those contracts charged to earnings above in the period the ineffectiveness was determined  we perform a sensitivity analysis on those contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for this sensitivity analysis we assume a hypothetical change in us dollar against foreign exchange rates based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of march 30 2013 a 10 devaluation of the us dollar compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of march 30 2013 would result in a decrease of approximately 19 million of net unrealized foreign currency loss conversely a 10 appreciation of the us dollar would result in an increase approximately of 19 million of net unrealized gains    38    table of contents interest rate risk  we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our credit facility our credit facility carries interest rates that are tied to libor and the prime rate and therefore our statements of operations and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates at march 30 2013 there was no outstanding balance on our credit facility the balance of our credit facility at march 30 2013 is not indicative of future balances that may be subject to fluctuations in interest rates any increases in either the prime rate or libor would cause an increase to the interest expense on our credit facility relative to any outstanding balance at that date
