or borrowings and additional losses and are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements we also urge you to carefully review the risk factors set forth in item 1arisk factors  overview  our business  we are a rapidly growing global luxury lifestyle brand led by a worldclass management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand over 30 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence over 85 countries as a highly recognized luxury lifestyle brand in north america with accelerating awareness in targeted international markets we have experienced exceptional sales momentum and intend to continue along this course as we grow our business  we operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of march 29 2014 our retail segment included 288 north american retail stores including concessions and 117 international retail stores including concessions in europe and japan as of march 29 2014 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 2496 department store and specialty store doors in north america and wholesale sales through approximately 1232 department store and specialty store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rights during fiscal 2014 our licensing segment accounted for approximately 42 of our total revenue and consisted of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses  we offer two primary collections the michael kors luxury collection and the michael michael kors accessible luxury collection the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced the michael michael kors collection which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods taken together our two collections target a broad customer base while retaining a premium luxury image  trends and uncertainties  disruptions in shipping and distribution our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure during the quarter ended september 28 2013 we experienced disruptions to the shipping of our products within the us as a result of implementing new material handling equipment and systems for purposes of automating our california distribution facility the disruption related to this implementation impacted our ability to ship at full capacity during the quarter ended september 28 2013 through the end of the quarter ended december 28 2013 in addition incremental expenses related to this implementation were incurred throughout this time period however we do not expect to incur additional expenses related to this issue beyond this fiscal year accordingly these disruptions to our shipping have had an impact on our earnings for this fiscal year with regards to the effects on both our net sales and operating expenses and any future disruptions of this nature may have a similar impact in the periods affected  establishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets we have yet to establish a substantial presence  costs of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash    24    table of contents  flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our products  demand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences currently demand for our products is predicted to grow according to the altagamma studies demand for the worldwide luxury goods industry is predicted to grow from approximately 2515 billion in 2011 to between 2956 billion and 3013 billion in 2014 the accessories product category represented 28 of total sales for the worldwide luxury goods industry in 2012 and was the fastest growing product category between 2005 and 2012 growing at a compound annual rate of 99 we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the accessories product category as it is one of our primary product category focuses  critical accounting policies  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements our most critical accounting policies discussed below pertain to revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation derivatives and income taxes in applying such policies we must use some amounts that are based upon our informed judgments and best estimates estimates by their nature are based upon judgments and available information the estimates that we make are based upon historical factors current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis  revenue recognition  we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual returns and by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 23 million 31 million and 17 million at march 29 2014 march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks as well as for certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 659 million 430 million and 304 million at march 29 2014 march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 respectively  royalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our trademarks at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales by licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our trademarks to sell our branded products in certain geographic regions  longlived assets  all longlived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization or depreciation for the purposes of impairment testing we group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease and our shopinshops are amortized over a three year period all of our amortization and depreciation expense is included as a component of total operating expenses as the underlying longlived assets are not directly or indirectly related to bringing our products to their existing location and condition  we evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded charges for impairments on fixed assets and intangible assets related to our retail segment of 13 million 07 million and 33 million respectively    25    table of contents goodwill  on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale and licensing segments which are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill is impaired prior to fiscal 2012 we performed our impairment testing for goodwill using the fair value approach employing both the discounted cash flow method and market multiples method to determine the fair value of our reporting units step one these methods utilized both our historical results and projected future results during fiscal 2012 we adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to goodwill impairment analysis which allows entities to initially perform a qualitative analysis step zero of the fair value of its reporting units to determine whether it is necessary to undertake a quantitative two step goodwill analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of all reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values  we will continue to perform this initial qualitative analysis in future years should the results of this assessment result in either ambiguous or unfavorable conclusion we will perform additional quantitative testing consistent with the fair value approach mentioned above the valuation methods used in the fair value approach discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require our management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations  we have assessed our goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter for the periods presented there are no impairment charges related to goodwill for any of the fiscal periods presented  sharebased compensation  we grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model for share options or the closing market price at the grant date for restricted shares and units these values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period and in the instance of performance based grants the attainment of certain vesting requirements in addition to the passage of time determining the fair value of share option awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term and riskfree rate  our expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for a performance based option is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased vesting options is based on the simplified method using the vesting term of generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in a holding periods ranging from 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys holding period as prior to december 2011 there was no historical option exercise experience due to the company being privately held the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve the period of which relates to the grants holding period if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the past  expense related to equity compensation during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 was approximately 291 million 209 million and 270 million respectively the weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was 2495 2066 and 801 respectively  derivative financial instruments  we use forward currency exchange contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes while the balance of these contracts are undesignated accordingly the changes in the fair value of those contracts not designated as hedges for accounting    26    table of contents  purposes are at the balance sheet date and upon maturity settlement recorded in our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were established regarding those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the same manner as those contracts charged to earnings above in the period the ineffectiveness was determined  for fiscal 2014 the loss charged to operations relating to these contracts was de minimis for fiscal years ended 2013 and 2012 respectively amounts representing gains of 14 million and 26 million were charged to operations the following table details the fair value of these contracts as of march 29 2014 and march 30 2013 in thousands                    march 292014     march 302013     prepaid expenses and other current assets    12      1367     accrued expenses and other current liabilities    1875      71    income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments  realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable  we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense  recent accounting pronouncements  we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and other than the recent pronouncement discussed below have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows based on current information  during the fiscal quarter ended june 29 2013 we adopted the provisions of accounting standard update 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 which the financial accounting standards board fasb issued in february 2013 asu 201302 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component the asu is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those periods beginning after december 15 2012    27    table of contents segment information  we

shipping and handling and consulting fees selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to 280 during fiscal 2014 compared to 285 for fiscal 2013 the decrease

aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales primarily from an increase in rent on our stores as a percentage of net retail sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale segment increased 1905 million or 707 to 4598 million during fiscal 2014 compared to 2693 million for fiscal 2013 income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales for the wholesale segment increased approximately 30 as a percentage

addition there was a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 12 as a percent of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2014    33    table of contents  the decrease in operating expenses as a

during both fiscal 2014 and 2013 were commitment fees and amortization of deferred financing fees  foreign currency loss  we recognized a foreign currency loss of 01 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to a foreign currency loss of 14 million during fiscal 2013 the decrease in foreign currency loss during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the balances of our us dollar denominated intercompany loan balances with certain of our nonus subsidiaries whose functional currency was other than the us dollar which yield translation gains or losses during their remeasurement during fiscal 2013 the larger balances of these us dollar denominated intercompany loans were impacted by the us dollars strengthening against the yen during that period  provision for income taxes  we recognized 3462 million of income tax expense during fiscal 2014 compared with 2295 million for fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 344 compared to 366 for fiscal 2013 the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted primarily due to a decrease in our us blended state income tax rate as well as a greater portion of our income being recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain other nondeductible expenses such as fees related to a public offering and income earned in certain nonus entities with significant net operating loss carryforwards in addition factors such as the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods  net income

increased 1938 million or 1590 to 3157 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 1219 million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net retail sales for the retail segment increased approximately 103 as a percentage of net retail sales to 297 during fiscal 2013 the increase as a percentage of net sales was due to an approximately 70 decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales as well as to the increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales resulted from the increase in our net retail sales during fiscal 2013 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling general and administrative expenses  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale segment increased 1843 million or 2169 to 2693 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 850 million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales for the wholesale segment increased approximately 122 as a percentage of net wholesale sales to 261 this increase was primarily due to an approximately 90 decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of wholesale sales as well as to the result of the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net wholesale sales resulted from the increase in our net wholesale sales during fiscal 2013 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling

million for fiscal 2012 income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue for the licensing segment decreased approximately 109 as a percentage of revenue to 518 this decrease is primarily the result of an increase in advertising expense during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 as we launched several new advertising initiatives including social media and other webbased mediums for increasing brand awareness during the year the increase in advertising expenses was offset in part by the aforementioned increase in sales licensing revenue  interest expense net  interest expense was approximately 15 million for both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 as average daily balance were not significantly differently year over year  foreign currency loss gain  we recognized a foreign currency loss of 14 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to a foreign currency gain of 26 million during fiscal 2012 the foreign currency loss during fiscal 2013 relative to the foreign currency gain during fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen which impacted the remeasurement of yendenominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries conversely during fiscal 2012 there were larger us dollar denominated intercompany loan balances with certain of our nonus subsidiaries whose functional currency was the euro which were impacted by the us dollars strengthening against the euro during that period  provision for income taxes  we recognized 2295 million of income tax expense during fiscal 2013 compared with 1015 million for fiscal 2012 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was 366 compared to 408 for fiscal 2012 the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted primarily due to a decrease in our us blended state income tax rate as well as a greater portion of our income being recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain other nondeductible expenses such as fees related to a public offering and income earned in certain nonus entities with significant net operating loss carryforwards in addition factors such as the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods  net income  as a result of the foregoing our net income increased 2502 million or 1698 to 3976 million during fiscal 2013 compared to 1474 million for fiscal 2012  liquidity and capital resources  liquidity  our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flows generated from our operations along with borrowings

our ongoing cash requirements including working capital requirements global retail store expansion and renovation construction and renovation of shopinshops investment in information systems infrastructure and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities we believe that the cash generated from our operations together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility

plans shopin shop growth continued systems development as well as web based sales and marketing initiatives we spent approximately 1847 million on capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 the majority

operating activities increased 2754 million to 6318 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to 3563 million for fiscal 2013 the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in our net income as well as an increase in changes to our accounts payable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 these increases were offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in changes to our accounts payable was largely related to the increases in our inventory purchases the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily due to the increase in our inventory requirements driven by our increased sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the decrease in changes to our accounts receivable was directly related to the increase in our sales which drove the increase to our accounts receivable balances during fiscal 2014  cash provided by operating activities increased 2410 million to 3563 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to 1153 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net income offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease in the change to our accounts receivable was attributable to our increasing sales during fiscal 2013 which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances relative to the prior fiscal year the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily to accommodate the increase to our net sales during fiscal 2013 in addition as we continue to open more retail stores we expect our expenditures on inventory to increase at a greater rate than the increase in our sales as inventory related to retail sales typically experiences slower inventory turnover than that of wholesale  cash used in investing activities  net cash used in investing activities was 2155 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 1391 million during fiscal 2013 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the buildout of our new retail stores which were constructed during fiscal 2014 shopinshops we installed
