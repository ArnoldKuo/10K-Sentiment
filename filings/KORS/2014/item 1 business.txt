stimulate sales in a consumerpreferred shopping venue as part of our direct marketing strategy our catalogs are sent to selected households to encourage consumer purchases and to build brand awareness in addition the growing number of visitors to our michaelkorscom online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of our database and to communicate with consumers to increase online and physical store sales and build brand awareness we launched michaelkorscom in 2007 in partnership with neiman marcus we sell merchandise to neiman marcus at wholesale which is subsequently resold by neiman marcus through michaelkorscom neiman marcus receives substantially all of the proceeds from these online sales this arrangement will continue through the launch of our own ecommerce website which is anticipated to occur during the middle of next fiscal year  manufacturing and sourcing  we contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent thirdparty manufacturing contractors whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process including the purchase of piece goods and trim although we do not have written agreements with any of our manufacturing contractors we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them we allocate product manufacturing among thirdparty agents based on their capabilities the availability of production capacity pricing and delivery we have relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contactors on our behalf although our relationships with our agents are generally terminable at any time we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them in fiscal 2014 and 2013 one thirdparty agent sourced approximately 126 and 140 of our finished goods purchases respectively in fiscal 2014 by dollar volume approximately 978 of our products were produced in asia and europe see import restrictions and other government regulations and risk factorswe primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  manufacturing contractors and agents operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing divisions and buying agents headquartered in north america europe and asia all products are produced according to our specifications production staff in the united states monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product quality assurance is focused upon as early as possible in the production process allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption  intellectual property  we own the michael kors and michael michael kors trademarks as well as other material trademark rights related to the production marketing and distribution of our products both in the united states and in other countries in which our products are principally sold we also have trademark applications pending for a variety of related logos we aggressively police our trademarks and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally we also pursue counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through our network of investigators and business partners around the world  pursuant to an agreement entered into by mr kors in connection with the acquisition by sportswear holdings limited of a majority interest in the company in 2003 mr kors i represented that all intellectual property rights used in connection with the companys business at such time were owned exclusively by the company ii assigned to the company to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the company exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the michael kors name and trademark and all derivations thereof as well as to

approximately 7451 our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good    9    table of contents competition  we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we compete our products compete with other branded products within their product category in our wholesale business we compete with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of accessories footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display moreover the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business  in varying degrees depending on the product category involved we compete on the basis of style price customer service quality brand prestige and recognition among other bases some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than us we believe however that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers see item 1arisk factorsthe markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within north america and internationally and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline  seasonality  we experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our wholesale and retail segments our wholesale segment experiences its greatest sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters while our first fiscal quarter experiences the lowest sales our retail segment experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of holiday season sales in the aggregate however with the exception of our first fiscal quarter which typically experiences significantly less sales volume relative to the other three quarters we do not experience significant quartertoquarter fluctuations in our sales moreover given our recent growth the effects of any seasonality are further muted by incremental sales related to our new retail stores wholesale doors and shopinshops  import restrictions and other governmental regulations  virtually all of our merchandise imported into the united states canada europe and asia is subject to duties in addition most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that in such increased quantities cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry we are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement see item 1arisk factorswe primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to regulation in the united states and other countries by governmental agencies including in the united states the federal trade commission and the consumer products safety commission these regulations relate principally to product labeling licensing requirements flammability testing and product safety we are also subject to environmental laws rules and regulations similarly accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the united states and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and noncommercial trade including the us fish and wildlife service we do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results  although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets
