advertising catalogs and brochures in order to stimulate sales in a consumerpreferred shopping venue as part of our direct marketing strategy our catalogs are sent to selected households to encourage consumer purchases and to build brand awareness in addition the growing number of visitors to our michaelkorscom online store provides an opportunity to increase the size of our database and to communicate with consumers to increase online and physical store sales and build brand awareness we launched michaelkorscom in 2007 in partnership with neiman marcus we sell merchandise to neiman marcus at wholesale which is subsequently resold by neiman marcus through michaelkorscom neiman marcus receives substantially all of the proceeds from these online sales this arrangement will continue through the launch of our own ecommerce website which is anticipated to occur during the middle of next fiscal year  manufacturing and sourcing  we contract for the purchase of finished goods principally with independent thirdparty manufacturing contractors whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process including the purchase of piece goods and trim although we do not have written agreements with any of our manufacturing contractors we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them we allocate product manufacturing among thirdparty agents based on their capabilities the availability of production capacity pricing and delivery we have relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contactors on our behalf although our relationships with our agents are generally terminable at any time we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them in fiscal 2014 and 2013 one thirdparty agent sourced approximately 126 and 140 of our finished goods purchases respectively in fiscal 2014 by dollar volume approximately 978 of our products were produced in asia and europe see import restrictions and other government regulations and risk factorswe primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  manufacturing contractors and agents operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing divisions and buying agents headquartered in north america europe and asia all products are produced according to our specifications production staff in the united states monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product quality assurance is focused upon as early as possible in the production process allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption  intellectual property  we own the michael kors and michael michael kors trademarks as well as other material trademark rights related to the production marketing and distribution of our products both in the united states and in other countries in which our products are principally sold we also have trademark applications pending for a variety of related logos we aggressively police our trademarks and pursue infringers both domestically and internationally we also pursue counterfeiters domestically and internationally through leads generated internally as well as through our network of investigators and business partners around the world  pursuant to an agreement entered into by mr kors in connection with the acquisition by sportswear holdings limited of a majority interest in the company in 2003 mr kors i represented that all intellectual property rights used in connection with the companys business at such time were owned exclusively by the company ii assigned to the company to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the company exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the michael kors name and trademark and all derivations thereof as well as to mr kors signature and likeness and all goodwill associated therewith iii agreed not to take any action against the company inconsistent with such ownership by the company including without limitation by asserting any privacy publicity or moral rights and iv agreed not to use whether or not he is employed by the company any of such intellectual property in connection with any commercial enterprise provided that he may use the name michael kors as his legal name only and not as service mark or trade name to identify himself personally and to engage in charitable activities and other activities that do not compete with any businesses of the company  employees  at the end of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 we had approximately 9184 6379 and 4180 total employees respectively as of march 29 2014 approximately 7451 our employees were engaged in retail selling and administrative positions and our remaining employees were engaged in other aspects of our business none of our employees are currently covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe that our relations with our employees are good    9    table of contents competition  we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we compete our products compete with other branded products within their product category in our wholesale business we compete with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of accessories footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display moreover the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business  in varying degrees depending on the product category involved we compete on the basis of style price customer service quality brand prestige and recognition among other bases some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial distribution marketing and other resources than us we believe however that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers see item 1arisk factorsthe markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within north america and internationally and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline  seasonality  we experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our wholesale and retail segments our wholesale segment experiences its greatest sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters while our first fiscal quarter experiences the lowest sales our retail segment experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of holiday season sales in the aggregate however with the exception of our first fiscal quarter which typically experiences significantly less sales volume relative to the other three quarters we do not experience significant quartertoquarter fluctuations in our sales moreover given our recent growth the effects of any seasonality are further muted by incremental sales related to our new retail stores wholesale doors and shopinshops  import restrictions and other governmental regulations  virtually all of our merchandise imported into the united states canada europe and asia is subject to duties in addition most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that in such increased quantities cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry we are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement see item 1arisk factorswe primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to regulation in the united states and other countries by governmental agencies including in the united states the federal trade commission and the consumer products safety commission these regulations relate principally to product labeling licensing requirements flammability testing and product safety we are also subject to environmental laws rules and regulations similarly accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the united states and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and noncommercial trade including the us fish and wildlife service we do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future our licensed products and licensing partners are also subject to regulation our agreements require our licensing partners to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and we are not aware of any violations that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results  although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets  item 1a risk factors  you should carefully read this entire report including without limitation the following risk factors and the section of this annual report entitled note regarding forwardlooking statements any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results    10    table of contents the accessories footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  the accessories footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that can affect consumer spending habits purchases of discretionary luxury items such as our products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending including general economic conditions consumer confidence wages and unemployment housing prices consumer debt interest rates fuel and energy costs taxation and political conditions a continuation or worsening of the current weakness in the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  privacy breaches and other cyber security risks related to our ecommerce business could negatively affect our reputation credibility and business  we are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and rely on third parties for the operation of parts of our ecommerce website michaelkorscom and for the various social media tools and websites we use as part of our marketing strategy during the second quarter of our fiscal 2015 year we expect to take over more of the direct operations of our ecommerce website and will be processing and storing customer transaction data on systems that are owned and operated by us or that are operated by our thirdparty providers consumers lawmakers and consumer advocates alike are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet consumer identity theft and privacy in addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves we require that thirdparty service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers identity and privacy we do not however control these thirdparty service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer breakins and security breaches will occur in the future likewise our systems and technology are subject to the risk of system failures viruses hackers and other causes that are out of our control any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding our customers or website visitors could harm our reputation and credibility reduce our ecommerce net sales impair our ability to attract website visitors and reduce our ability to attract and retain customers and expose us to significant related liability finally we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state federal and foreign laws regarding the use and unauthorized disclosure of personal information to the extent they are applicable we also may incur significant costs in our implementation of additional security measures to comply with applicable laws and industry standards and to further protect customer data  we face risks associated with operating in international markets  we operate on a global basis with approximately 215 of our total revenue coming from operations outside of the us during fiscal 2014 the current political and economic instability and changing macroeconomic conditions in major international markets including europe and japan have resulted in significant macroeconomic risks including high rates of unemployment high fuel prices currency volatility and continued global economic uncertainty driven in part by the european debt crisis and geo political tensions among other factors these risks may adversely affect discretionary consumer spending in the international markets in which we operate which could negatively affect sales of our products in these markets in addition if the global macroeconomic environment experiences a downturn including if the economic situation in europe worsens our gross margin rates may be negatively impacted  a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we rely extensively on our information technology it systems to track inventory manage our supply chain record and process transactions manage customer communications summarize results and manage our business the failure of our it systems to operate properly or effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business in addition our it systems may be subject to damage andor interruption from power outages computer network and telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers security breaches usage errors by our employees and bad acts by our customers and website visitors if our it systems are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer loss of critical data including our customer data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim any significant disruption in our it systems could harm our reputation and credibility and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating results  the accessories footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to    11    table of contents  changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design styling production merchandising and pricing of products if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trendsetting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating results  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within north america and internationally and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline  we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories footwear and apparel producers and retailers including among others coach burberry ralph lauren hermès louis vuitton gucci marc jacobs chloé tori burch and prada competition is based on a number of factors including without limitation the following            anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner            establishing and maintaining favorable brandname recognition            determining and maintaining product quality            maintaining key employees            maintaining and growing market share            developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers            establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers            pricing products appropriately            providing appropriate service and support to retailers            optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities            determining size and location of retail and department store selling space and            protecting intellectual property  in addition some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial technological manufacturing sales marketing and distribution resources than we do their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories footwear and apparel industries compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business any increased competition or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors could result in reduced sales which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  competition along with such other factors as consolidation and changes in consumer spending patterns could also result in significant pricing pressure these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels andor otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses our profitability may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  the departure of our founder members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business in particular mr kors our honorary chairman and chief creative officer has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services mr kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause in addition the leadership of john d idol our chairman and chief executive officer and joseph b parsons our executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer and treasurer has been a critical element of our success we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing design and advertising operations competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees although we have entered into employment agreements with mr kors and certain of our other executive officers including mr idol and mr parsons we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to or relating to the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    12    table of contents the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products  as part of our growth strategy we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shopinshops within select department stores both domestically and internationally our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops depends on many factors including among others our ability to            identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores including concessions and shopinshops will be considered successful            negotiate acceptable lease terms including desired tenant improvement allowances to secure suitable store locations            hire train and retain personnel and field management            assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture            source sufficient inventory levels and            successfully integrate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops into our existing operations and information technology systems  we will encounter preoperating costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops commence operations while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores including concessions and shopinshops in the future there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable any such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally including our efforts to further expand our operations in european countries and in japan as well as other asian countries in some of these countries we do not yet have significant operating experience and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations many of these countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate including lease terms and local reporting or legal requirements furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in addition in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively our brand image and financial performance may suffer  we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size if our operations continue to grow we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing product development and distribution functions to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel our continued growth could strain our existing resources and we could experience operating difficulties including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms difficulties in hiring training and managing an increasing number of employees difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities if one or more of our distribution facilities experiences operational difficulties or becomes inoperable it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we operate a limited number of distribution facilities our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale customers and our own retail stores depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our wholesale customers and retail stores in addition we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    13    table of contents in addition we have been moving into new and larger facilities as needed to increase our capacity as we grow and have been concurrently implementing new warehouse management systems to further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility there are risks inherent in operating in new distribution environments and implementing new warehouse management systems including operational difficulties that may arise with such transitions we may experience shipping delays should there be any disruptions in our new warehouse management systems or warehouses themselves  as we expand our store base we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past which could cause our share price to decline  as we expand our store base we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically in addition we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations the price of our ordinary shares could decline in addition the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot including among others fashion trends competition current economic conditions pricing inflation the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events changes in our merchandise mix the success of marketing programs and weather conditions if we misjudge the market for our products we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations which could harm our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares  we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under longterm noncancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  we do not own any of our store facilities instead we lease all of our stores under operating leases our leases generally have terms of 10 years with no renewal options our leases generally require a fixed annual rent and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs for example as of march 29 2014 we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to 6435 million through fiscal 2019 and approximately 4367 million thereafter through fiscal 2029 we expect that any new stores we open under operating leases will have terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously which will further increase our operating lease expenses  our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences including among others            increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            limiting our ability to obtain additional financing            requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations thus reducing cash available for other purposes            limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete and            placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors  we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses grow our business respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs  our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control   we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell under our trademarks products requiring specialized expertise we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas including among others south korea the philippines singapore malaysia indonesia australia the middle east russia turkey china hong kong macau taiwan latin america and the caribbean and india in addition we have entered into similar licensing agreements with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our current shareholders including mr kors mr idol and sportswear holdings limited pursuant to which we have granted such entities certain rights to distribute and sell our products in china hong kong macau and taiwan see note 17 to our financial statementsagreements with shareholders and related party transactions in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners such arrangements may not be successful our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own such as the timing of new store openings the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products in addition the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business including risks associated with each such partners ability to            obtain capital    14    table of contents         exercise operational and financial control over its business            manage its labor relations            maintain relationships with suppliers            manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and            maintain customer relationships  any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements  we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through among other things approval rights over store location and design product design production quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our stores and products we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of each of our licensed brands the misuse of our brands by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue  a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 289 of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 and 293 of our total revenue for fiscal 2013 our largest wholesale customer a large nationally recognized us department store accounted for 144 of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 and 140 of our total revenue for fiscal 2013 we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an orderbyorder basis a decision by any of our major wholesale customers whether motivated by marketing strategy competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability during the past several years the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes will continue in addition store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products andor may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer  the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  our products are primarily produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in countries in asia europe and central and south america a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a    15    table of contents  timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices any of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results            political or labor instability labor shortages stemming from labor disputes or otherwise or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located            significant delays or disruptions in delivery of our products due to labor disputes or strikes at the location of the source of our goods andor at us ports of entry            political or military conflict involving the united states which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs            heightened terrorism security concerns which could subject imported or exported goods to additional more frequent or more thorough inspections leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods leading to lost sales increased costs for our anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands            a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials            disease epidemics and healthrelated concerns which could result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas            the migration and development of manufacturing contractors which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced            imposition of regulations quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations which among other things could limit our ability to produce products in costeffective countries that have the labor and expertise needed            increases in the costs of fuel travel and transportation            imposition of duties taxes and other charges on imports            significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies and            restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located  we do not have written agreements with any of our thirdparty manufacturing contractors as a result any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time in fiscal 2014 our largest manufacturing contractor who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for the last ten years accounted for the production of 304 of our finished products our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and costefficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and impact the cost and availability of our goods  in addition we use thirdparty agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time in fiscal 2014 our largest thirdparty agent whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for the last ten years sourced approximately 126 of our purchases of finished goods our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and costefficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  if we fail to comply with labor laws or if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable ethical business practices our business and reputation could suffer  we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation  in addition we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance however we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    16    table of contents our business is subject to risks associated with importing products  there are risks inherent to importing our products virtually all of our merchandise imported into the united states canada europe and asia is subject to duties and most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that in such increased quantities cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry in addition accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the united states and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and noncommercial trade including the us fish and wildlife service fampw fampw requires that we obtain a license to import animal and fauna that are subject to regulation by fampw and can revoke or refuse to renew this license seize and possibly destroy our shipments andor fine the company for fampw violations the imposition of duties and quotas the initiation of an antidumping action andor the repercussions of fampw violations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies  we have a 2000 million senior unsecured credit facility the 2013 credit facility under which michael kors usa inc mkusa michael kors europe bv michael kors canada co and michael kors switzerland gmbh our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries are borrowers and we are a parent guarantor the credit agreement governing the terms of the 2013 credit facility restricts among other things asset dispositions mergers and acquisitions dividends share repurchases and redemptions other restricted payments indebtedness loans and investments liens and affiliate transactions our credit agreement also contains customary events of default including a change in control of the company in addition our credit agreement contains financial covenants such as requiring an adjusted leverage ratio of 35 to 10 with the ratio being total consolidated indebtedness plus 80 times consolidated rent expense to ebitda plus consolidated rent expense and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10 with the ratio being ebitda plus consolidated rent expense to the sum of fixed charges plus consolidated rent expense see credit discussion in managements discussion and analysisliquidity these covenants among other things limit our ability to fund our future working capital needs and capital expenditures engage in future acquisitions or development activities or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt  we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and others may allege that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights our brand enjoys significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of our products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and those seeking to infringe on our products such counterfeiting and other infringement could dilute our brand and harm our business  the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or other infringement of our intellectual property rights our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought and others may seek to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and intellectual property rights in addition others may assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in trademarks that are similar to ours or trademarks that we license andor market and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases trademark owners may have prior rights to our trademarks or similar trademarks furthermore certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we become involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks similar to some of our brands any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights or any allegation that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could be costly and timeconsuming and could result if determined adversely to us in harm to our competitive position  our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  our results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars during the process of financial statement consolidation if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations in addition we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our nonus subsidiaries which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity as a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of that subsidiary results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the currency in which the note is denominated in    17    table of contents future sales of our ordinary shares or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur may depress the price of our ordinary shares  sales of a substantial number of our ordinary shares in the public market or the perception that such sales may occur could have a material adverse effect on the price of our ordinary shares pursuant to the shareholders agreement our preipo shareholders including michael kors john d idol and sportswear holdings limited an entity owned by two of our directors messrs silas k f chou and lawrence s stroll have demand and piggyback rights that will require us to file registration statements registering their ordinary shares or to include sales of such ordinary shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other shareholders in the event such registration rights are exercised and a large number of ordinary shares are sold in the public market such sales could reduce the trading price of our ordinary shares in addition the perception that these sales might occur could cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decrease significantly  provisions in our organizational documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party  our memorandum of association and articles of association together as amended from time to time our memorandum and articles of association contains several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors these provisions also may delay prevent or deter a merger acquisition tender offer proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares these provisions include among others            our board of directors ability to amend the memorandum and articles of association to create and issue from time to time one or more classes of preference shares and with respect to each such class to fix the terms thereof by resolution            provisions relating to the multiple classes and threeyear terms of directors the manner of election of directors removal of directors and the appointment of directors upon an increase in the number of directors or vacancy on our board of directors            restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call meetings and bring proposals before meetings            elimination of the ability of shareholders to act by written consent and            the requirement of the affirmative vote of 75 of the shares entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our memorandum and articles of association  these provisions of our memorandum and articles of association could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares  rights of shareholders under british virgin islands law differ from those under united states law and accordingly our shareholders may have fewer protections  our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association the bvi business companies act 2004 as amended the bvi act and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands and by the bvi act the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law as a result of the foregoing holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a us company    18    table of contents the laws of the british virgin islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs  under the laws of the british virgin islands there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the bvi act dealing with shareholder remedies as summarized under item 10 additional information memorandum and articles of association the principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a british virgin islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the bvi act and the memorandum and articles of association of the company as such if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the bvi act or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association then the courts will likely grant relief generally the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following i an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority ii acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company iii acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders such as the right to vote and iv acts where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the united states  it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the united states  under our memorandum and articles of association we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them subject to limited exceptions furthermore to the extent allowed by law the rights and obligations among or between us any of our current or former directors officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the british virgin islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the british virgin islands courts unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such although there is doubt as to whether united states courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the united states under united states securities laws these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the british virgin islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the british virgin islands or jurisdictions that would apply british virgin islands law  british virgin islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interests  british virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a british virgin islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred the british virgin islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of united states securities law or to impose liabilities in original actions brought in the british virgin islands based on certain liability provisions of the united states securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce the nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered  legislation has been introduced that would if enacted treat us as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes  on february 7 2012 us senator carl levin introduced legislation in the us senate entitled the cut loopholes act us senator levin and us representative lloyd doggett originally introduced similar legislative proposals in 2009 and similar legislation was proposed in 2010 and 2011 if enacted this legislation would among other things cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us tax purposes as generally any entity whose shares are publicly traded on an established securities market or whose gross assets are 50 million or more if the management and control of such a corporation is directly or indirectly is treated as occurring primarily within the united states the proposed legislation provides that a corporation will be so treated if substantially all of the executive officers and senior management of the corporation who exercise daytoday responsibility for making decisions involving strategic financial and operational policies of the corporation are located primarily within the united states to date this legislation has not been approved by either the house of representatives or the senate however we can provide no assurance that this legislation or similar legislation will not ultimately be adopted any such modification to the us federal income tax laws that affects the tax residency of a nonus company managed and controlled in the united states could adversely affect the us federal taxation of some or all of our income and the value of our ordinary shares  failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares  as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act so that our management can certify the effectiveness of our internal controls on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares    19    table

believe or similar words concerning future events the forwardlooking statements contained herein include without limitation statements concerning future revenue sources and concentration gross profit margins selling and marketing expenses capital expenditures general and administrative expenses capital resources new stores additional financings or borrowings and additional losses and are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements we also urge you to carefully review the risk factors set forth in item 1arisk factors  overview  our business  we are a rapidly growing global luxury lifestyle brand led by a worldclass management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand over 30 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence over 85 countries as a highly recognized luxury lifestyle brand in north america with accelerating awareness in targeted international markets we have experienced exceptional sales momentum and intend to continue along this course as we grow our business  we operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of march 29 2014 our retail segment included 288 north american retail stores including concessions and 117 international retail stores including concessions in europe and japan as of march 29 2014 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 2496 department store and specialty store doors in north america and wholesale sales through approximately 1232 department store and specialty store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rights during fiscal 2014 our licensing segment accounted for approximately 42 of our total revenue and consisted of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses  we offer two primary collections the michael kors luxury collection and the michael michael kors accessible luxury collection the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced the michael michael kors collection which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods taken together our two collections target a broad customer base while retaining a premium luxury image  trends and uncertainties  disruptions in shipping and distribution our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure during the quarter ended september 28 2013 we experienced disruptions to the shipping of our products within the us as a result of implementing new material handling equipment and systems for purposes of automating our california distribution facility the disruption related to this implementation impacted our ability to ship at full capacity during the quarter ended september 28 2013 through the end of the quarter ended december 28 2013 in addition incremental expenses related to this implementation were incurred throughout this time period however we do not expect to incur additional expenses related to this issue beyond this fiscal year accordingly these disruptions to our shipping have had an impact on our earnings for this fiscal year with regards to the effects on both our net sales and operating expenses and any future disruptions of this nature may have a similar impact in the periods affected  establishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets we have yet to establish a substantial presence  costs of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash    24    table of contents  flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our products  demand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences currently demand for our products is predicted to grow according to the altagamma studies demand for the worldwide luxury goods industry is predicted to grow from approximately 2515 billion in 2011 to between 2956 billion and 3013 billion in 2014 the accessories product category represented 28 of total sales for the worldwide luxury goods industry in 2012 and was the fastest growing product category between 2005 and 2012 growing at a compound annual rate of 99 we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the accessories product category as it is one of our primary product category focuses  critical accounting policies  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements our most critical accounting policies discussed below pertain to revenue recognition impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation derivatives and income taxes in applying such policies we must use some amounts that are based upon our informed judgments and best estimates estimates by their nature are based upon judgments and available information the estimates that we make are based upon historical factors current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis  revenue recognition  we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual returns and by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 23 million 31 million and 17 million at march 29 2014 march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks as well as for certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 659 million 430 million and 304 million at march 29 2014 march 30 2013 and march 31 2012 respectively  royalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our trademarks at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales by licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our trademarks to sell our branded products in certain geographic regions  longlived assets  all longlived assets are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization or depreciation for the purposes of impairment testing we group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease and our shopinshops are amortized over a three year period all of our amortization and depreciation expense is included as a component of total operating expenses as the underlying longlived assets are not directly or indirectly related to bringing our products to their existing location and condition  we evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value we recognize an impairment loss measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 we recorded charges for impairments on fixed assets and intangible assets related to our retail segment of 13 million 07 million and 33 million respectively    25    table of contents goodwill  on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale and licensing segments which are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill is impaired prior to fiscal 2012 we performed our impairment testing for goodwill using the fair value approach employing both the discounted cash flow method and market multiples method to determine the fair value of our reporting units step one these methods utilized both our historical results and projected future results during fiscal 2012 we adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to goodwill impairment analysis which allows entities to initially perform a qualitative analysis step zero of the fair value of its reporting units to determine whether it is necessary to undertake a quantitative two step goodwill analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 we used this new guidance in our annual impairment analysis for goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of all reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values  we will continue to perform this initial qualitative analysis in future years should the results of this assessment result in either ambiguous or unfavorable conclusion we will perform additional quantitative testing consistent with the fair value approach mentioned above the valuation methods used in the fair value approach discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require our management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations  we have assessed our goodwill for impairment in our fourth quarter for the periods presented there are no impairment charges related to goodwill for any of the fiscal periods presented  sharebased compensation  we grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model for share options or the closing market price at the grant date for restricted shares and units these values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period and in the instance of performance based grants the attainment of certain vesting requirements in addition to the passage of time determining the fair value of share option awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term and riskfree rate  our expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for a performance based option is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased vesting options is based on the simplified method using the vesting term of generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in a holding periods ranging from 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys holding period as prior to december 2011 there was no historical option exercise experience due to the company being privately held the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve the period of which relates to the grants holding period if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the past  expense related to equity compensation during fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 was approximately 291 million 209 million and 270 million respectively the weighted average grant date fair value of share options granted during fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 was 2495 2066 and 801 respectively  derivative financial instruments  we use forward currency exchange contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes while the balance of these contracts are undesignated accordingly the changes in the fair value of those contracts not designated as hedges for accounting    26    table of contents  purposes are at the balance sheet date and upon maturity settlement recorded in our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were established regarding those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the same manner as those contracts charged to earnings above in the period the ineffectiveness was determined  for fiscal 2014 the loss charged to operations relating to these contracts was de minimis for fiscal years ended 2013 and 2012 respectively amounts representing gains of 14 million and 26 million were charged to operations the following table details the fair value of these contracts as of march 29 2014 and march 30 2013

taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments  realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable  we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense  recent accounting pronouncements  we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and other than the recent pronouncement discussed below have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows based on current information  during the fiscal quarter ended june 29 2013 we adopted the provisions of accounting standard update 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201302 which the financial accounting standards board fasb issued in february 2013 asu 201302 requires an

approximately 04 as a percentage of net retail sales to 293 during fiscal 2014 the decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to an approximately 06 increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales offset in part by the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales primarily from an increase in rent on our stores as a percentage of net retail sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale

loss of 01 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to a foreign currency loss of 14 million during fiscal 2013 the decrease in foreign currency loss during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the balances of our us dollar denominated intercompany loan balances with certain of our nonus subsidiaries whose functional currency was other than the us dollar which yield translation gains or losses during their remeasurement during fiscal 2013 the larger balances of these us dollar denominated intercompany loans were impacted by the us dollars strengthening against the yen during that

recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in

                              cash provided by operating activities  cash provided by operating activities increased 2754 million to 6318 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to 3563 million for fiscal 2013 the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in our net income as well as an increase in changes to our accounts payable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 these increases were offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in changes to our accounts payable was largely related to the increases in our inventory purchases the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily due to the increase in our inventory requirements driven by our increased sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the decrease in changes to our accounts receivable was directly related to the increase in our sales which drove the increase to our accounts receivable balances during fiscal 2014  cash provided by operating activities increased 2410 million to 3563 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to 1153 million for fiscal 2012 the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to an increase in our net income offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 the decrease in the change to our accounts receivable was attributable to our increasing sales during fiscal 2013 which resulted in higher accounts receivable balances relative to the prior fiscal year the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily to accommodate the increase to our net sales during fiscal 2013 in addition as we continue to open more retail stores we expect our expenditures on inventory to increase at a greater rate than the increase in our sales as inventory related to retail sales typically experiences slower inventory turnover than that of wholesale  cash used in investing activities  net cash used in investing activities was 2155 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 1391 million during fiscal 2013 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the buildout of our new retail stores which were constructed during fiscal 2014 shopinshops we installed during fiscal 2014 as well as certain technology initiatives undertaken during the year which related to distribution system enhancements and various other improvements to our infrastructure in addition we purchased approximately 288 million of intangible assets related to certain of our stores opened during fiscal 2014 as well as made an investment in our joint venture for approximately 20 million during fiscal 2014  net cash used in investing activities was 1391 million during fiscal 2013 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 882 million during fiscal 2012 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of the buildout of our new retail stores which were constructed during fiscal 2013 shopinshops we installed during fiscal 2013 as well as certain technology initiatives undertaken during the year which related to distribution system enhancements and various other improvements to our infrastructure in addition we purchased approximately 85 million of intangible assets related to certain of our stores opened during fiscal 2013 as well as made an investment in and loan to a joint venture for approximately 32 million and 60 million respectively during fiscal 2013    39    table of contents cash provided by financing activities  net cash provided by financing activities was 711 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1506 million during fiscal 2013 after excluding the noncash effects of tax benefits from the exercise of share options cash provided by financing activities increased by 103 million this increase was primarily due to the net repayments on our revolving credit facility of 227 million during fiscal 2013 this increase was offset in part by a decrease of 114 million in cash received from the exercise of employee share options during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  net cash provided by financing activities was 1506 million during fiscal 2013 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 586 million during fiscal 2012 after excluding the noncash effects of tax benefits from the exercise of share options cash provided by financing activities decreased by 203 million this decrease was primarily due to the net repayments on our revolving credit facility of 227 million during fiscal 2013 as compared to net borrowings of 99 million during fiscal 2012 this decrease was offset in part by an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee share options during fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012  revolving credit facilities  senior unsecured revolving credit facility  on february 8 2013 we terminated the provisions of our existing 2011 credit facility and entered into a senior unsecured credit facility 2013 credit facility pursuant to the agreement the 2013 credit facility provides for up to 2000 million of borrowings and expires on february 8 2018 the agreement also provides for loans and letters of credit to our european subsidiaries of up to 1000 million the 2013 credit facility

consolidated rent expense and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10 with the ratio being ebitda plus consolidated rent expense to the sum of fixed charges plus consolidated rent expense restricts and limits additional indebtedness and restricts the incurrence of additional liens and cash dividends as of march 29 2014 we were in compliance with all of our covenants covered under this agreement  borrowings under the 2013 credit facility accrue interest at the rate per annum announced from time to time by the agent a rate based on the rates applicable for deposits in the london interbank market for us dollars or the applicable currency in which the loans are made the adjusted libor plus an applicable margin the applicable margin may range from 125 to 175 and is based or dependent upon a particular threshold related to the adjusted leverage ratio calculated during the period of borrowing for fiscal 2014 the weighted average interest rate for the revolving credit facility was 16 the

leases and the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable operating leases for our real estate locations globally in addition to the above amounts we are typically required to pay real estate taxes contingent rent based on sales volume and other occupancy costs relating to our leased properties for our retail stores  excluded from the above commitments is 190 million of longterm liabilities related to uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty of the time and nature of resolution    40    table of contents the above table also excludes amounts included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of march 29 2014 as these items will be paid within one year and noncurrent liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them eg deferred taxes  we do not have any longterm purchase obligations that represent firm commitments at march 29 2014  offbalance sheet arrangements  we have not created and are not party to any specialpurpose or offbalance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital incurring debt or operating our business we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources  effects of inflation  we do not believe that our sales or operating results have been materially impacted by inflation during the periods presented in our financial statements however we may experience an increase in cost pressure from our suppliers in the future which could have an adverse impact on our gross profit results in the periods effected      item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we are exposed to certain market risks during the normal course of our business such as risk arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as fluctuations in interest rates in attempts to manage these risks we employ certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations currently we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure to the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies the use of these instruments helps to manage our exposure to our foreign purchase commitments and better control our product costs other than these purchase commitments we do not use these foreign exchange contracts for any other purposes in addition we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes  foreign currency exchange risk  we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts currently a relatively small portion are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes accordingly the changes in the fair value of the majority of these contracts at the balance sheet date and upon maturity settlement are recorded in our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were established regarding those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the same manner as those contracts charged to earnings above in the period the ineffectiveness was determined  we perform a sensitivity analysis on those contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for this sensitivity analysis we assume a hypothetical change in us dollar against foreign exchange rates based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of march 29 2014 a 10 devaluation of the us dollar compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of march 29 2014 would result in a decrease of approximately 21 million of net unrealized foreign currency loss conversely a 10 appreciation of the us dollar would result in an increase approximately of 16 million of net unrealized gains    41    table of contents interest rate risk  we are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our credit facility our credit facility carries interest rates that are tied to libor and the prime rate and therefore our statements of operations and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates at march 29 2014 there was no outstanding balance on our credit facility the balance of our credit facility at march 29 2014 is not indicative of future balances that may be subject to fluctuations in interest rates any increases in either the prime rate or libor would cause an increase to the interest expense on our credit facility relative to any outstanding balance at that date      item 8

policies  use of estimates  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment and make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are completed the most significant assumptions and estimates involved in preparing the financial statements include allowances for customer deductions sales returns sales discounts and doubtful accounts estimates of inventory recovery the valuation of sharebased compensation valuation of deferred taxes and the estimated useful lives used for amortization and depreciation of intangible assets and property and equipment actual results could differ from those estimates  revenue recognition  the company recognizes retail store revenues upon sale of its products to retail consumers net of estimated returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss is transferred to the companys wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual customer returns as well as by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns sales taxes collected from retail customers are presented on a net basis and as such are excluded from revenue to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations trade discounts markdowns allowances and operational chargebacks as well as for certain cooperative selling expenses    56    table of contents

2013 and march 31 2012 advertising expense was 657 million 419 million and 314 million respectively  cooperative advertising expense which represents the companys participation in advertising expenses

respectively  shipping and handling  shipping and handling costs amounting to 786 million 291 million and 197 million for fiscal 2014 fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively are included in selling general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations  cash and cash equivalents  all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents  inventories  inventories consist of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market value cost is determined using the weighted average cost method costs include amounts paid to independent manufacturers plus duties and freight to bring the goods to the companys warehouses which are located in the united states holland canada japan and hong kong the company adjusts its inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of inventory is not expected to be fully recovered these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations for the periods presented there were no significant adjustments related to unsalable inventory  store preopening costs  costs associated with the opening of new retail stores and start up activities are expensed as incurred    57    table of contents property and equipment  property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization carrying value depreciation is provided on a straightline basis over the expected remaining useful lives of the related assets equipment furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five to seven years and computer hardware and software are depreciated over three to five years leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the estimated remaining useful lives of the related assets or remaining lease term the company includes all its amortization and depreciation expense as a component of total operating expenses as the underlying longlived assets are not directly or indirectly related to bringing the companys products to their existing location and condition  the companys share of the cost of constructing instore shop displays within its wholesale customers floorspace shopinshops which is paid directly to thirdparty suppliers is capitalized as property and equipment and is generally amortized over a useful life of three years  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense in the year incurred cost and related accumulated depreciation for property and equipment are removed from the accounts upon their sale or disposition and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations  internaluse software  the company capitalizes in property and equipment direct costs incurred during the application development stage and the implementation stage for developing purchasing or otherwise acquiring software for internal use these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software generally five years all costs incurred during the preliminary project stage including project scoping identification and testing of alternatives are expensed as incurred  intangible assets  intangible assets consist of trademarks and lease rights and are stated at cost less accumulated amortization trademarks are amortized over twenty years and lease rights are amortized over the term of the related lease agreements on a straightline basis  impairment of longlived assets  the company evaluates its longlived assets including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable if the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the assets carrying value an impairment charge is recognized which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows  goodwill  on an annual basis the company evaluates goodwill for impairment during the companys fourth quarter of its fiscal year or whenever impairment indicators exist judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill may be impaired to the extent that the fair value associated with the goodwill is less than its carrying amount the company writes down the carrying amount of the goodwill to its fair value  prior to fiscal 2012 the company assessed goodwill for impairment by calculating the fair value of the companys reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated using the discounted cash flow method along with the market multiples method during fiscal 2012 the company adopted a new accounting pronouncement related to goodwill impairment analysis which allows entities to initially perform a qualitative analysis step zero of the fair value of its reporting units to determine whether it is necessary to undertake a quantitative two step goodwill analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 the company continued to follow this guidance with respect to its annual impairment analysis for goodwill and concluded that the carrying amounts of all reporting units were significantly exceeded by their respective fair values and thus performing any further analysis eg two step was unnecessary  the company will continue to perform the aforementioned qualitative analysis step zero in future fiscal years as its first step in goodwill impairment assessment should the results of this assessment result in either an ambiguous or unfavorable conclusion the company will perform additional quantitative testing consistent with the fair value approach mentioned above the valuation methods used in the fair value approach discounted cash flow and market multiples method require the companys management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of the companys reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value to compute the implied fair value the company would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to    58    table of contents  all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill the company would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things the companys business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations  joint venture investments  the company accounts for investments in joint ventures as equity investments and records them in other assets in the companys consolidated balance sheets during fiscal 2013 the company made a nonrecourse loan to the companys sole joint venture which resides in latin america for approximately 60 million which accrues at a 5 annual rate the purpose of the loan was to provide working capital for the joint ventures operations the 60 million loan is repayable at the time of the expiration of the joint venture agreement along with accrued interest payable at the expiration date the loan along with accrued interest are recorded in other assets in the companys consolidated balance sheets  sharebased compensation  the company grants sharebased awards to certain employees and directors of the company awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value as calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model for share options or the closing market price at the grant date for restricted shares and units these fair values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period based on attainment of certain vesting requirements for performance grants or the passage of time for those grants which have timebased vesting requirements determining the fair value of sharebased awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term and riskfree rate  the companys expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is the companys range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for options which vest based on performance requirements are based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years which directly correlates to the companys service period requirement for such options generally the expected holding period for timebased vesting options no performance requirements are calculated using the simplified method which uses the vesting term of the options generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in a holding period of 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys estimated holding period as prior to december 2011 the company was privately held and as such there is insufficient historical option exercise experience the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve the period of which relates to the grants estimated holding period if factors change and the company employs different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what the company has estimated in the past  foreign currency translation and transactions  the financial statements of the majority of the companys foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency the companys functional currency is the united states dollar usd for mkhl and its united states based subsidiaries assets and liabilities have been translated using periodend exchange rates and revenues and expenses have been translated using average exchange rates over the reporting period the adjustments resulting from translation have been recorded separately in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss foreign currency transaction income and losses resulting from the remeasuring of transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity are included in the consolidated statements of operations  derivative financial instruments  the company uses forward currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of its transactions the company in its normal course of business enters into transactions with foreign suppliers and seeks to minimize risks related to these transactions the company employs these forward currency contracts to hedge the companys cash flows as they relate to foreign currency transactions of which certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes while others are undesignated hedges for hedge accounting purposes these derivative instruments are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheets at fair value regardless of if they are designated or undesignated as hedges  prior to the companys third fiscal 2013 quarter ended december 29 2012 the company did not designate these instruments as hedges for hedge accounting purposes during the third fiscal 2013 quarter the company elected to designate contracts entered into during and subsequent to that quarter as hedges for hedge accounting purposes for contracts related to the purchase of inventory accordingly the effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts entered into during fiscal 2014 are recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and to cost of sales for any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective the company will continue to record changes in the fair value of hedge designated contracts in this manner until their maturity where the unrealized gain or loss will be recognized into earnings in that period for those contracts entered into    59    table of contents  currently and in the future that are not and will not be designated as hedges changes in the fair value as of each balance sheet date and upon maturity are recorded in cost of sales or operating expenses within the companys consolidated statements of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward exchange contracts were intended to hedge during fiscal 2014 a net realized loss related to the change in fair value of those contracts not designated as hedges were de minimis in addition the net unrealized loss related to those contracts designated as hedges during fiscal 2014 of 29 million was charged to equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss during fiscal 2014 amounts related to the ineffectiveness of these contracts were de minimis the company expects that substantially all the amounts currently residing in accumulated other comprehensive loss to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months based upon the timing of inventory purchases and turns these amounts are subject to fluctuations in the applicable currency exchange rates  the following table details the fair value of these contracts as of march 29 2014 and march 30 2013 in thousands                    march 292014     march 302013     prepaid expenses and other current assets    12      1367     accrued expenses and other current liabilities    1875      71    the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations in attempts to mitigate counterparty credit risk the company enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors adhering to established limits for credit exposure the aforementioned forward contracts generally have a term of no more than 12 months the period of these contracts is directly related to the foreign transaction they are intended to hedge the notional amount of these contracts outstanding at march 29 2014 was approximately 1551 million which was comprised predominately of those designated as hedges  income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities have been provided for temporary differences between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of the companys assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse the company periodically assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or estimates and judgments used  realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction the company periodically reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and provides valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized the companys management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if the companys estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable  the company recognizes the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on its income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority an uncertain income tax position will be recognized if it has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained the tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions the company records interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense  rent expense deferred rent and landlord construction allowances  the company leases office space retail stores and distribution facilities under agreements that are classified as operating leases many of these operating leases include contingent rent provisions percentage rent andor provide for certain landlord allowances related to tenant improvements and other relevant items rent expense is calculated by recognizing total minimum rental payments net of any rental abatements construction allowances and other rental concessions on a straightline basis over the lease term accordingly rent expense charged to operations differs from rent paid resulting in the company recording deferred rent which is classified as a longterm liability in the companys consolidated balance sheets the recognition of rent expense for a given operating lease commences on the earlier of the lease commencement date or the date of possession of the property the company accounts for landlord allowances and incentives as a component of deferred rent which is amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense the company records rent expense as a component of selling general and administrative expenses    60    table of contents deferred financing costs  the company defers costs directly associated with acquiring third party financing these deferred costs are amortized on a straightline basis which approximates the effective interest method as interest expense over the term of the related indebtedness as of march 29 2014 deferred financing costs were 29 million net of accumulated amortization of 28 million and as of march 30 2013 deferred financing costs were 34 million net of accumulated amortization of 20 million deferred financing costs are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets  net income per share  the company reported earnings per share in conformity with the twoclass method for calculating and presenting earnings per share for fiscal years prior to fiscal 2013 due to the existence of both ordinary and convertible preference securities in those periods under the twoclass

financial position  11 fair value of financial instruments  financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value using a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements the determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or liability depends on the inputs used in the valuation as of the measurement date notably the extent to which the inputs are marketbased observable or internally derived unobservable observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs based on a companys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows  level 1valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a company has the ability to access at the measurement date  level 2valuations based on quoted inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data  level 3valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement  the company has historically entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure for certain inventory purchases from its manufacturers in europe and asia as well as commitments for certain services the forward contracts that are used in the program mature in twelve months or less consistent with the related planned purchases or services the company

financial instruments the company employs forward currency contracts to hedge the companys exposures as they relate to certain forecasted inventory purchases in foreign currencies and as such are
