we are exposed to certain market risks during the normal course of our business such as risk arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as fluctuations in interest rates in attempts to manage these risks we employ certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure to the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies the use of these instruments primarily helps to manage our exposure to our foreign purchase commitments and better control our product costs we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposesforeign currency exchange riskwe are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency exchange contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes while certain of these contracts currently a relatively small portion are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes accordingly the changes in the fair value of the majority of these contracts at the balance sheet date are recorded in our equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon maturity settlement are recorded in or reclassified into our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward currency exchange contracts were established for those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the period the ineffectiveness was determinedwe perform a sensitivity analysis on our forward currency contracts both designated and not designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for this sensitivity analysis we assume a hypothetical change in us dollar against foreign exchange rates based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of april 2 2016 a 10 appreciation or devaluation of the us dollar compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of april 2 2016 would result in a net increase and decrease respectively of approximately 20 million in the fair value of these contractsinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to our 2015 credit facility our 2015 credit facility carries interest rates that are tied to libor and the prime rate among other institutional lending rates depending on the particular origination of borrowing and therefore our statements of operations and cash flows are exposed to changes in those interest rates at april 2 2016 and march 28 2015 there were no balances outstanding on our 2015 credit facility or our prior 2013 credit facility which is not indicative of future balances under the 2015 credit facility that may be subject to fluctuations in interest rates any increases in the applicable interest rates would cause an increase to the interest expense on our 2015 credit facility relative to any outstanding balance at that date
