face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we compete our products compete with other branded products within their product category in varying degrees depending on the product category involved we compete on the basis of style price customer service quality brand prestige and recognition among other bases in our wholesale business we compete with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of accessories footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display moreover the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our businessover the last several years the accessories category in particular has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors we believe however that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers see item 1a risk factors  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within

less sales volume relative to the other three quarters and our third fiscal quarter generally has higher sales volume relative to the other three quarters import restrictions and other governmental regulationsvirtually all of our merchandise imported into the united states canada europe and asia is subject to duties in addition most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that in such increased quantities cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry we are also subject to other international trade agreements and regulations such as the north american free trade agreement see item

apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that can affect consumer spending habits purchases of discretionary luxury items such as our products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending including general economic conditions consumer confidence wages and unemployment housing prices consumer debt interest rates fuel and energy costs

effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business any increased competition or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors could result in reduced sales which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultscompetition along with other factors such as consolidation changes in consumer spending patterns and a highly promotional environment could also result in significant pricing pressure these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels andor otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses our profitability may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results11table of contentsour retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop

concerns war terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on us particularly if such events impact our customers desire to travel to our

store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations the price of our ordinary shares could decline in addition the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot including among others fashion trends competition current economic conditions pricing inflation the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events changes in our merchandise mix the success of marketing programs and weather conditions if we misjudge the market for our products we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products these factors may cause our

of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shareswe may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating resultsthe accessories footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design styling production merchandising and pricing of products if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trendsetting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating resultsthe success of our business

otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers in addition we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility any of the foregoing factors could result in decreased sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating resultsin addition we have been moving into new and larger facilities as needed to increase our capacity as we grow and have been concurrently implementing new warehouse management systems to further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility there are risks inherent in operating in new distribution environments and implementing new warehouse management systems including operational difficulties that may arise with such transitions we may experience

federal and international laws that may be enacted to address those threatsour business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsour results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars during financial statement consolidation if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations in addition we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our nonus subsidiaries which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity as a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note we continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates however we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsas a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound the japanese yen the korean won and the canadian dollar a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased priceswe face risks associated with operating in international markets and our strategy to continue to expand internationallywe operate on a global basis with approximately 299 of our total revenue from operations outside of the us during fiscal 2016 as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including political and economic instability in foreign countries laws regulations and policies of foreign governments potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies political or civil unrest acts of terrorism military actions or other conditions economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations we also sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins depending on geographic region due to a variety of factors including product mix store size occupancy costs labor costs and retail pricing changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues increased costs and negatively impact our business financial condition and operating resultsthere are some countries where we do not yet have significant operating experience and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations many countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate including lease terms and local reporting or legal requirements furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in addition in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results14table of contentsthe departure of our founder members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our businesswe depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business in particular mr kors our honorary chairman and chief creative officer has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services mr kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause in addition the leadership of john d idol our chairman and chief executive officer and joseph b parsons our executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer and treasurer has been a critical element of our success we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing design and advertising operations competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees although we have entered into employment agreements with mr kors and certain of our other executive officers including mr idol and mr parsons we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to or relating to the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating resultsthe growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores and to increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our productsas part of our growth strategy we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shopinshops within select department stores both domestically and internationally our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops depends on many factors including among others our ability toidentify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores including concessions and shopinshops will be considered successfulnegotiate acceptable lease terms including desired tenant improvement allowances to secure suitable store locationshire train and retain personnel and field managementassimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culturesource sufficient inventory levels andsuccessfully integrate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops into our existing operations and information technology systemswe will encounter preopening costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops commence operations certain of our european stores require investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores including concessions and shopinshops in the future there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable any changes from our initial expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating resultswe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under longterm noncancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultswe do not own any of our store facilities instead we lease all of our stores under operating leases our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years our leases generally require a fixed annual rent and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount certain of our european stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs for example as of april 2 2016 we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to 1079 billion through fiscal 2021 and approximately 7467 million thereafter through fiscal 2033 we expect that any new stores we open under operating leases will have terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously which will further increase our operating lease expenses15table of

available to us we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses grow our business respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needsour current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited controlwe have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell under our trademarks products requiring specialized expertise we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas such as the middle east eastern europe brazil certain parts of asia and australia in addition we have a joint venture that covers the distribution and sale of products and the operation of retail stores in latin america and the caribbean excluding brazil in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners such arrangements may not be successful our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own such as the timing of new store openings the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products in addition the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business including risks associated with each such

brands although we attempt to protect our brands through among other things approval rights over store location and design product design production quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our stores and products we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of our brand the misuse of our brand by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating resultsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenuea small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales net sales to our five largest wholesale

wholesale customers whether motivated by marketing strategy competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability during the past several years the retail industry has experienced 16table of contentsa great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes will continue in addition store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products andor may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could decrease our opportunities in the

our business financial condition and operating resultsincreases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to sufferthe costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be

is designed to maximize our longterm growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of net sales earnings per share comparable store sales and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we

have fewer protectionsour corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles the bvi business companies act 2004 as amended the bvi act and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands and by the bvi act the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law as a result of the foregoing holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a us companythe laws of the british virgin islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairsunder the laws of the british virgin islands there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the bvi act dealing with shareholder remedies as summarized under item 10  additional information  memorandum and articles of association the principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a british virgin islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the bvi act and the memorandum and articles of association of the company as such if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the bvi act or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association then the courts will likely grant relief generally the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following i an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority ii acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company iii acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders such as the right to vote and iv acts where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the united statesit may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the united statesunder our memorandum and articles we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them subject to limited exceptions furthermore to the extent allowed by law the rights and obligations among or between us any of our current or former directors officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the british virgin islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the british virgin islands courts unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such although there is doubt as to whether united states courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the united states under united states securities laws these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the british virgin islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the british virgin islands or jurisdictions that would apply british virgin islands lawbritish virgin islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interestsbritish virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a british virgin islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred the british virgin islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of united states securities law or to impose liabilities in original actions brought in the british virgin islands based on certain liability provisions of the united states securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce the nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover

businesswe are a global luxury lifestyle brand led by a worldclass management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand 35 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries as a highly recognized luxury lifestyle brand in the americas with accelerating awareness in targeted international markets we have experienced sales momentum and intend to continue along this course as we grow our businesswe operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of april 2 2016 our retail segment included 390 retail stores in the americas including concessions 278 international retail stores including concessions throughout europe and asia and our ecommerce sites in the united states us and canada as of april 2 2016 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 1532 department store doors and 929 specialty store doors in the americas and wholesale sales through approximately 1222 specialty store doors and 206 department store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rights during fiscal 2016 our licensing segment accounted for approximately 37 of our total revenue and consisted of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenseswe offer three primary collections the michael kors collection luxury line the michael michael kors accessible luxury line and the michael kors mens line the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried by many of our retail stores our ecommerce sites as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced michael michael kors which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods more recently we have begun to grow our mens business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our brands established fashion authority and the expanding mens market taken together our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury imagecertain factors affecting financial condition and results of operationsestablishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets where we have yet to establish a substantial presence in addition our growth strategy includes assuming direct control of certain international operations which allows us to better manage our growth opportunities in the related regions during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we made additional capital contributions to our latin american joint venture mk panama holdings sa and subsidiaries mk panama obtaining a 75 controlling interest in mk panama as such we began to consolidate mk panama into our operations beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2016 see note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information in addition on january 1 2016 we assumed direct control over the previously licensed business in south korea during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 we plan to further expand our global presence by acquiring certain of our currently licensed operations in the greater china region see note 21  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information26table of contentsdemand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences while the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has been recently challenged by lower consumer traffic trends promotional selling environment resulting from a channel shift a decrease in tourist travel restrained consumer spending and other factors we expect that our products will continue to be desired by our endconsumerscurrency fluctuation and the strengthening us dollar our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationships between our reporting currency the us dollar and those of our nonus subsidiaries whose functionallocal currency is other than the us dollar the recent decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar has impacted the conversion of the results of our european operations as they are reported which represent approximately 21 of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2016 during fiscal 2016 the euro experienced a decline in value relative to us dollar of approximately 13 as compared to fiscal 2015 in addition our fiscal 2016 results have been negatively impacted by a decline of 13 in the canadian dollar and a decline of approximately 9 in japanese yen relative to the us dollar as compared to fiscal 2015 disruptions in shipping and distribution our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure as well as due to external factors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 our us third party operated ecommerce fulfillment center was impacted by structural damage which resulted in shipping delays to consumers who ordered merchandise through our ecommerce website in addition we were impacted by the work slowdowns and stoppages resulting from the labor dispute at the us west coast ports during fiscal 2015 which created a backlog of containers at the ports and resulted in inventory delivery delays which continued into fiscal 2016 any future disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operationscosts of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our productscritical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in applying such policies we must make certain assumptions based on our informed judgments assessments of probability and best estimates estimates by their nature are subjective and are based on analysis of available information including current and historical factors and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis while our significant accounting policies are detailed in note 2 to the accompanying financial statements our critical accounting policies are discussed below and include revenue recognition inventories impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation derivatives and income taxesrevenue recognitionrevenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the price has been fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns revenue from sales through our ecommerce site is recognized at the time of delivery to the customer reduced by an estimate of returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual customer returns as well as by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 47 million 25 million and 23 million at april 2 2016 march 28 2015 and march 29 2014 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations as well as trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks and certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 1109 million 875 million and 659 million at april 2 2016 march 28 2015 and march 29 2014 respectively these estimates are based on such factors as historical trends actual and forecasted performance and market conditions which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis our historical estimates of these costs were not materially different from actual results27table of contentsas of april 2 2016 a hypothetical 1 increase in allowances for our reserves for sales returns discounts markdowns and other allowances would have decreased our fiscal 2016 revenues by approximately 12 millionroyalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our tradenames at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as it is earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales of licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our tradenames to sell our branded products in specific geographic regionsinventoriesour inventory costs include amounts paid to independent manufacturers plus duties and freight to bring the goods to the companys warehouses which are located in the united states holland canada japan south korea and hong kong we continuously evaluate the composition of our inventory and make adjustments when the cost of inventory is not expected to be fully recoverable the net realizable value of our inventory is estimated based on historical experience current and forecasted demand and market conditions in addition reserves for inventory losses are estimated based on historical experience and physical inventory counts our inventory reserves are estimates which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations our historical estimates of these adjustments have not differed materially from actual resultslonglived assetswe evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable for the purposes of impairment testing we group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease including highly probable renewals and our shopinshops are amortized over a useful life of three or four years our impairment testing is based on our best estimate of the future operating cash flows if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the assets carrying value we recognize an impairment charge which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows and future impairments may result if actual cash flows are lower than our expectations for fiscal 2016 fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 we recorded charges for impairments on fixed assets primarily related to our retail segment of 109 million 08 million and 13 million respectively see note 6 to the accompanying consolidated audited financial statements for additional informationgoodwillwe perform an impairment assessment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale retail and licensing segments where our goodwill is recorded and are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the businesswe may assess our goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach step zero to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is greater than its carrying value if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value a quantitative goodwill analysis would be performed to determine if impairment is required we may also elect to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill initially rather than using a qualitative approach the valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations future events could cause us to conclude the impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill may be impaired28table of contentsduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 we elected to bypass the initial qualitative assessment and performed our annual impairment analysis using a quantitative approach using the discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value based on the results of this assessment we concluded that the fair values of all reporting units significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in any of the fiscal periods presentedsharebased compensationwe grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors the grant date fair value of share options is calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires us to use subjective assumptions the closing market price at the grant date is used to determine the grant date fair value of restricted shares restricted share units and performance restricted share units these values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures based on expected attainment of preestablished performance goals for performance grants or the passage of time for those grants which have only timebased vesting requirementsour expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for performancebased options is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased options is calculated using a simplified method which uses the vesting term of the options generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in holding periods of 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys estimated holding period as prior to december 2011 the company was privately held and as such there is insufficient historical option exercise experience the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve based on the grants estimated holding period determining the grant date fair value of sharebased awards requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term riskfree rate and forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the pastderivative financial instrumentswe use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less which is consistent with the related purchase commitments we designate certain contracts related to the purchase of inventory that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges while others remain undesignated all of our derivative instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a gross basis regardless of their hedge designation the effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item effects earnings when the inventory related to forecasted inventory purchases that are being hedged is sold to a third party the gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized within cost of goods sold we use regression analysis to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that are designated as hedges which compares the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the change in the related hedged item effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis and any portion of the designated hedge contracts deemed ineffective is recorded to foreign currency gain loss if the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in the future future changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings for those contracts that are not designated as hedges changes in the fair value are recorded in foreign currency gain loss in our consolidated statements of operationsthe company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors adhering to established limits for credit exposureincome taxesdeferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments29table of contentsrealization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viablewe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expenserecently adopted accounting pronouncementsin november 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance
