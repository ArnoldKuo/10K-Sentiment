the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried in many of our retail stores as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world including bergdorf goodman saks fifth avenue neiman marcus and holt renfrew among others in 2004 we saw an opportunity to capitalize on the brand strength of the michael kors collection and address the significant demand opportunity in

among others more recently we have begun to grow our mens business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our brands established fashion authority and the expanding mens market taken together our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury image4table of contentsindustrywe operate in the global luxury goods industry over the past ten years the luxury goods industry has grown and has remained resilient during economic downturns however the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has recently been challenged by a number of factors including lower consumer traffic trends a promotional selling environment lower tourist travel currency effects restrained consumer spending and a shift in spending from personal luxury goods to luxury experiences as a result while accessories have remained the biggest personal luxury goods category the level of growth within this category while still positive has decelerated from prior years in addition the consumer demand within the luxury watch and luxury apparel categories has experienced a decline while the wholesale channel has been challenged the retail channel has continued to grow largely driven by the rapid growth of the ecommerce channel and increased offprice sales which has continued to cannibalize brick and mortar retail store sales as the overall environment has become increasingly omnichannel increased customer engagement and tailoring merchandise to customer shopping and communication preferences have become the key ingredients to winning market share we believe that our innovative product offerings and customer engagement initiatives make us well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the luxury accessories product category as it is one of our primary product categories of focus as well as to grow our sales in other product categoriesgeographic informationwe generate revenue globally through our three segments through our retail and

degrees depending on the product category involved we compete on the basis of style price customer service quality brand prestige and recognition among other bases in our wholesale business we compete with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of accessories footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display moreover the general availability of manufacturing

store selling space andprotecting intellectual propertyin addition some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial technological manufacturing sales marketing and distribution resources than we do their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories footwear and apparel industries compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business any increased competition or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors could result in reduced revenues which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating resultscompetition along with other factors such as consolidation changes in consumer spending patterns and a highly promotional environment could also result in significant pricing pressure these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels andor otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses our profitability may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating resultsour retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop and a decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales andor average sales per square foot which could cause our share price to

per square foot if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations the price of our ordinary shares could declinein addition the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot including among others fashion trends competition current economic conditions pricing inflation the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events changes in our merchandise mix the success of marketing programs and weather conditions if we misjudge the market for our products we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shareswe may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating resultsthe accessories footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences we believe that our success is largely dependent on our brand image and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design styling production merchandising and pricing of products if we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately consumers may not purchase our products and our brand name and brand image may be impaired even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences consumers may consider our brand image to be outdated or associate our brand with styles that are no longer popular or trendsetting any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand business financial condition and operating results12table of contentsthe success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable digital experience for our customers we strive to give our customers a jetset shopping experience both in stores and through digital technologies such as computers mobile phones tablets and other devices we also use social media to interact with our customers

historically been subject to cyclical variations recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that can affect consumer spending habits purchases of discretionary luxury items such as our products tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower the success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending including general economic conditions consumer confidence wages and unemployment housing prices consumer debt interest rates fuel and energy costs taxation and

states government could impose a border adjustment tax which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government or the governments of other countries to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry or the industry of such other country as applicable if the united states imposes import duties or other protective import measures other countries could retaliate in ways that could harm the international distribution of our products we are also dependent on international trade agreements and

our wholesale customers and our own retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers in addition we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility any of the foregoing factors could result in decreased sales and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionin addition we have been moving into new and larger facilities as needed and have been concurrently implementing new warehouse management systems to further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility there are risks inherent in operating in

could have a material adverse effect on our businesswe depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business in particular mr kors our honorary chairman and chief creative officer has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services mr kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause in addition the leadership of john d idol our chairman and chief executive officer has been a critical element of our success we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing design and advertising operations competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees although we have entered into employment agreements with mr kors and certain of our other executive officers including mr idol we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to or relating to the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionfluctuations in our tax obligations and changes in tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future effective tax rates and results of operationsour subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction as a result our overall effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of earnings from the various tax jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any time there are multiple tax years that are subject to examinations by various taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement amount that differs from our original estimate the united states government has called for comprehensive tax reform which among other things might change certain us tax rules impacting the way us based multinationals are taxed on us and foreign income any proposed or future changes in tax laws and regulations or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rates results of operations and financial conditionon march 26 2015 the united kingdom uk enacted new diverted profits tax legislation the dpt which is effective on april 1 2015 under the dpt profits of certain multinational enterprises such as the company deemed to have been artificially diverted from the uk will be taxed at a rate of 25 while the company believes that all of its affiliated entities and the transactions among them have the required economic substance there is no assurance that this legislation will not have a material effect on its results of operations and financial conditionwe and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions although we believe that these transactions reflect arms length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place which should be respected for tax purposes the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities which could result in additional tax liabilities on october 5 2015 the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd an international association of thirty four countries including the us and uk released the final reports from its base erosion and profit shifting beps action plans the beps recommendations covered a number of issues including countrybycountry reporting permanent establishment rules transfer pricing rules and tax treaties future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to longstanding tax principles which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilitieswe face risks associated with operating in international markets and our strategy to continue to expand internationallywe operate on a global basis with approximately 343 of our total revenue from operations outside of the us during fiscal 2017 as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including political and economic instability in foreign countries laws regulations and policies of foreign governments potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies political or civil unrest acts of terrorism military actions or other conditions economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations we also sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins depending on geographic region due to a variety of factors including product mix store size occupancy costs labor costs and retail pricing changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues increased costs and negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition15table of contentsthere are some countries where we do not yet have significant operating experience and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations many countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate including lease terms and local reporting or legal requirements furthermore consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in addition in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionin addition on june 23 2016 voters in the united kingdom uk approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union brexit the brexit vote and the perceptions as to the impact of the withdrawal of the uk from the european union eu may adversely affect business activity political stability and economic conditions in the uk the eu and elsewhere negotiations on withdrawal and postexit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the terms timing or consummation of any such arrangements the proposed withdrawal could adversely affect the tax currency operational legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject the withdrawal could also disrupt the free movement of goods services and people between the uk and the eu and significantly disrupt trade between the uk and the eu and other parties there can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionacquisitions may not be successfully integrated and may not achieve intended benefitswe face additional risks associated with our strategy to expand internationally through the acquisition of our geographic licensees on january 1 2016 we transitioned the previously licensed business in south korea to a wholly owned operation and on may 31 2016 we acquired our previously licensed business in the greater china region which includes china hong kong macau and taiwan we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any licensee or another entity that we acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration the potential difficulties that we may face that could cause the results of the acquisition to not be in line with our expectations include among othersfailure to implement our business plan for the combined businessdelays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assetshigher than expected costs lower than expected cost savings andor a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficultiesunanticipated issues in integrating logistics information and other systemsunanticipated

act of 2002our acquisitions may not perform as well as initially expected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we also have a controlling interest in our joint venture in latin america mk panama and consolidate this joint venture into our operations we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment and our joint venture also exposes us to risks to the extent that our joint venture partner may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours take actions contrary to our policies or objectives experience financial or other difficulties or be unable or unwilling to fulfill their obligations under the joint venture agreement any of which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition16table of contentsa substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenuea small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 210 of our total revenue for fiscal 2017 and 258 of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 our largest wholesale customer macys accounted for 89 of our total revenue for fiscal 2017 and 127 of our total revenue for fiscal 2016 we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an orderbyorder basis a decision by any of our major wholesale customers whether motivated by marketing strategy competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability during the past several years the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes will continue in addition store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products andor may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial conditionour business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsour results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into us dollars during financial statement consolidation if the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations in addition we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our nonus subsidiaries which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity as a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note we continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates however we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuationsas a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound the chinese yuan renminbi the japanese yen the korean won and the canadian dollar among others a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased priceswe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under longterm noncancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases if we close a leased retail space we remain obligated under the applicable lease we also may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms we do not own any of our store facilities instead we lease all of our stores under operating leases our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years generally require a fixed annual rent and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount certain of our european stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs for example as of april 1 2017 we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to 1093 billion through fiscal 2022 and approximately 5493 million thereafter through fiscal 2035 we recently announced that we intend to optimize our retail store fleet including through the closure of between 100 and 125 of fullprice underperforming retail stores in connection with this retail fleet optimization we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for among other things payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term in some instances we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation provisions in our leases in addition as each of our leases expire we may be unable to negotiate renewals either on commercially acceptable terms or at all which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations our substantial operating lease obligations including with respect to closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition17table of contentsour business may be negatively impacted due to excess inventories if we misjudge the demand for our productswe are subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors including competition a highly promotional selling environment and changes in consumer spending patterns if we fail to anticipate identify and respond effectively to changing consumer demands and fashion trends we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products if that occurs we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess and slowmoving inventory which may negatively impact our gross margin and profitabilityour share price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forwardlooking statements regarding our financial performanceour business and longrange planning process is designed to maximize our longterm growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter we believe that this longerterm focus is in the best interests of the company and our shareholders at the same time however we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of total revenue earnings per share comparable store sales and other financial metrics or projections while we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forwardlooking statements at such times or otherwise in addition any longerterm guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe at the time guidance is given are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years however such longrange targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations if or when we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us outside investment analysts or others our share price could be adversely affected investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk we take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our share pricewe periodically return value to shareholders through our share repurchase program investors may have an expectation that we will repurchase all shares available under our share repurchase program the market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our share repurchase activity differs from investors expectations or if our share repurchase program were to terminateour current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited controlwe have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell under our trademarks products requiring specialized expertise we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas such as the middle east eastern europe brazil certain parts of asia and australia in addition we have a joint venture that covers the distribution and sale of products and the operation of retail stores in latin america excluding brazil and the caribbean in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners such arrangements may not be successful our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own such as the timing of new store openings the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products in addition the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business including risks associated with each such partners ability toobtain capitalexercise operational and financial control over its businessmanage its labor relationsmaintain relationships with suppliersmanage its credit and bankruptcy risks andmaintain customer relationshipsany of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangementswe rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through among other things approval rights over store location and design product design production quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our stores and products we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of our brand the misuse of our brand by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition18table of contentsincreases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial

fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials the ultimate effect of this change on

significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of our products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters to infringe on our brand we work with customs authorities law enforcement legal representatives and brand specialists globally in an effort to prevent the sale of counterfeit michael kors products but we cannot guarantee the extent to which our efforts to prevent counterfeiting of our brand and other intellectual property infringement will be successful such counterfeiting and other infringement could dilute our brand and harm our reputation and

that are similar to ours or trademarks that we license andor market and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction in some cases trademark owners may have prior rights to our trademarks or similar trademarks furthermore certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united statesfrom time to time in the ordinary course of our business we become involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks similar to some of our brands any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights or any allegation that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could be costly and

things may limit our ability to fund our future working capital needs and capital expenditures engage in future acquisitions or development activities or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on debtfailure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary sharesas a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have an adverse effect on our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary sharesprovisions in our organizational documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third partyour memorandum and articles of association together as amended from time to time our memorandum

may delay prevent or deter a merger acquisition tender offer proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their

proposals before meetingselimination of the ability of shareholders to act by written consent andthe requirement of the affirmative vote of 75 of the shares entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our memorandum and articlesthese provisions of our memorandum and articles could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares21table of contentsrights of shareholders under british virgin islands law differ from those under united states law and accordingly our shareholders may have fewer protectionsour corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles the bvi business companies act 2004 as amended the bvi act and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands and by the bvi act the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law as a result of the foregoing holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a us companythe laws of the british virgin islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairsunder the laws of the british virgin islands there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the bvi act dealing with shareholder remedies the principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a british virgin islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the bvi act and the memorandum and articles of association of the company as such if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the bvi act or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association then the courts will likely grant relief generally the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following i an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority ii acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company iii acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders such as the right to vote and iv acts where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the united statesit may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the united statesunder our memorandum and articles we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them subject to limited exceptions furthermore to the extent allowed by law the rights and obligations among or between us any of our current or former directors officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the british virgin islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the british virgin islands courts unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such although there is doubt as to whether united states courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the united states under united states securities laws these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the british virgin islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the british virgin islands or jurisdictions that would apply british virgin islands lawbritish virgin islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interestsbritish virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a british virgin islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred the british virgin islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of united states securities law or to impose liabilities in original actions brought in the british virgin islands based on certain liability provisions of the united states securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce the nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered22table

management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand over 35 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries we are a highly recognized luxury fashion brand in the americas and europe with accelerating brand awareness in other international marketswe operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of april 1 2017 our retail segment included 398 retail stores in the americas including concessions 429 international retail stores including concessions throughout europe and asia our ecommerce sites in the united states us and canada as well as our recently launched ecommerce sites in europe china and japan as of april 1 2017 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 1405 department store doors and 904 specialty store doors in the americas and wholesale sales through approximately 1099 specialty store doors and 199 department store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rightswe offer three primary collections the michael kors collection luxury line the michael michael kors accessible luxury line and the michael kors mens line the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried by many of our retail stores our ecommerce sites as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced michael michael kors which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods more recently we have begun to grow our mens business in recognition of the significant opportunity afforded by our brands established fashion authority and the expanding mens market taken together our primary collections target a broad customer base while retaining our premium luxury imagecertain factors affecting financial condition and results of operationsestablishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets where we have yet to establish a substantial presence in addition our growth strategy includes assuming direct control of certain international operations which allows us to better manage our growth opportunities in the related regions during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we made additional capital contributions to our latin american joint venture mk panama holdings sa and subsidiaries mk panama obtaining a 75 controlling interest in mk panama and began to consolidate mk panama into our operations beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2016 on january 1 2016 we acquired the previously licensed business in south korea on may 31 2016 we further expanded our global presence by acquiring the previously licensed operations in the greater china region please refer to note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information27table of contentschannel shift and demand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences in addition the accessible luxury retail and wholesale industry has been recently challenged by lower consumer traffic trends a promotional selling environment resulting from a channel shift and other political and economic factors during fiscal 2017 we began to strategically reduce shipments to decrease promotional activity within our wholesale channel which we believe is necessary to appropriately position our brand longterm consumer spending has been increasingly constrained due to a decrease in tourist travel and a shift in consumer spending from luxury products to luxury experiences in addition consumer shopping preferences have continued to shift from physical stores to online shopping while this trend has resulted in an increase in our ecommerce sales it has had a negative impact on our brick and mortar stores we currently expect that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future as a result we recorded impairment charges of 1992 million during fiscal 2017 as compared to 109 million during fiscal 2016 and 08 million in fiscal 2015 primarily associated with underperforming fullprice retail stores please refer to notes 11 and 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information we continue to adjust our operating strategy to the changing business environment and on may 31 2017 we announced that we plan to close between 100 and 125 of our fullprice retail stores over the next two years in order to improve the profitability of our retail store fleet over this time period we expect to incur approximately 100  125 million of onetime costs associated with these store closures collectively we anticipate ongoing annual savings of approximately 60 million as a result of the store closures and the lower depreciation and amortization associated with the impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2017currency fluctuation and the strengthening us dollar our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationships between our reporting currency the us dollar and those of our nonus subsidiaries whose functionallocal currency is other than the us dollar our fiscal 2017 results have been negatively impacted by the declines in value of the british pound relative to the us dollar of approximately 13 compared to the same prior year period following the affirmative vote by the united kingdom to leave the european union earlier this fiscal year as well as by the increased volatility of the euro conversely our results have been positively impacted by increases in the value of the japanese yen relative to the us dollar of approximately 11disruptions in shipping and distribution our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure as well as due to external factors any future disruptions in our shipping and distribution network could have a negative impact on our results of operationscosts of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our productscritical accounting policiesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in applying such policies we must make certain assumptions based on our informed judgments assessments of probability and best estimates estimates by their nature are subjective and are based on analysis of available information including current and historical factors and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis while our significant accounting policies are detailed in note 2 to the accompanying financial statements our critical accounting policies are discussed below and include revenue recognition inventories impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation derivatives and income taxesrevenue recognitionrevenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the price has been fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns revenue from sales through our ecommerce sites is recognized at the time of delivery to the customer reduced by an estimate of returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual customer returns as well as by a provision for estimated future 28table of contentscustomer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 73 million 47 million and 25 million at april 1 2017 april 2 2016 and march 28 2015 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations as well as trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks and certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 967 million 1109 million and 875 million at april 1 2017 april 2 2016 and march 28 2015 respectively these estimates are based on such factors as historical trends actual and forecasted performance and market conditions which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis our historical estimates of these costs were not materially different from actual resultsroyalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our tradenames at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as it is earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales of licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our tradenames to sell our branded products in specific geographic regionsinventoriesour inventory costs include amounts paid to independent manufacturers plus duties and freight to bring the goods to the companys warehouses which are located in the united states holland canada china hong kong japan south korea and taiwan we continuously evaluate the composition of our inventory and make adjustments when the cost of inventory is not expected to be fully recoverable the net realizable value of our inventory is estimated based on historical experience current and forecasted demand and market conditions in addition reserves for inventory losses are estimated based on historical experience and inventory counts our inventory reserves are estimates which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations our historical estimates of these adjustments have not differed materially from actual resultslonglived assetswe evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable for the purposes of impairment testing we group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease including highly probable renewals and our shopinshops are amortized over a useful life of three or four years our impairment testing is based on our best estimate of the future operating cash flows if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the assets carrying value we recognize an impairment charge which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows and future impairments may result if actual cash flows are lower than our expectations during fiscal 2017 we recorded impairment charges of 1992 million which were primarily related to fixed assets and lease rights for underperforming fullprice retail stores during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 we recorded fixed asset impairment charges of 109 million and 08 million respectively primarily related to our retail segment please refer to notes 6 7 11 and 18 to the accompanying consolidated audited financial statements for additional informationgoodwillwe perform an impairment assessment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale retail and licensing segments where our goodwill is recorded and are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the businesswe may assess our goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach step zero to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is greater than its carrying value if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value a quantitative goodwill analysis would be performed to determine if impairment is required we may also elect to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill initially rather than using a qualitative approach the valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would 29table of contentsassign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations future events could cause us to conclude the impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill may be impairedduring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we elected to bypass the initial qualitative assessment and performed our annual impairment analysis using a quantitative approach using the discounted cash flow method to estimate fair value based on the results of this assessment we concluded that the fair values of all reporting units significantly exceeded the related carrying amounts and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in any of the fiscal periods presentedsharebased compensationwe grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors the grant date fair value of share options is calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires us to use subjective assumptions the closing market price at the grant date is used to determine the grant date fair value of restricted shares restricted share units and performance restricted share units these values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures based on expected attainment of preestablished performance goals for performance grants or the passage of time for those grants which have only timebased vesting requirementsour expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for performancebased options is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased options is calculated using a simplified method which uses the vesting term of the options generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in holding periods of 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys estimated holding period as prior to december 2011 the company was privately held and as such there is insufficient historical option exercise experience the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve based on the grants estimated holding period determining the grant date fair value of sharebased awards requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term riskfree rate and forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the pastderivative financial instrumentswe use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less which is consistent with the related purchase commitments we designate certain contracts related to the purchase of inventory that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges while others remain undesignated all of our derivative instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a gross basis regardless of their hedge designation the effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item effects earnings when the inventory related to forecasted inventory purchases that are being hedged is sold to a third party the gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized within cost of goods sold we use regression analysis to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that are designated as hedges which compares the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the change in the related hedged item effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis and any portion of the designated hedge contracts deemed ineffective is recorded to foreign currency gain loss if the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in the future future changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings for those contracts that are not designated as hedges changes in the fair value are recorded in foreign currency gain loss in our consolidated statements of operationsthe company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors adhering to established limits for credit exposure30table of contentsincome taxesdeferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgmentsrealization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viablewe recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax

2017 compared with 3346 million for fiscal 2016 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 199 compared to 285 for fiscal 2016 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the favorable effect of global financing activities as well as the increase in taxable income in certain of our nonus subsidiaries predominantly european operations during fiscal 2017 which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates due to substantial international growth and expansion over the past several years and our company being a uk tax resident we believe that it is most appropriate to reconcile our effective tax rate to the uk statutory tax rateour effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes and tax rates in foreign

during fiscal 2015 the decline in gross profit margin was attributable to gross profit margin declines of 230 basis points from our retail segment and 80 basis points from our wholesale segment the decrease in gross profit margin from our retail segment was primarily due to an increase in promotional activity during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 the decrease in gross profit margin from our wholesale segment was primarily due to an increase in wholesale allowances during fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 these declines were partially offset by a favorable geographic mix in

as state tax benefits recognized during fiscal 2016 given that certain of our nonus operations have become consistently profitable we expect this decrease on our combined consolidated effective rate

the periods effecteditem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to certain market risks during the normal course of our business such as risk arising from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as well as fluctuations in interest rates in attempts to manage these risks we employ certain strategies to mitigate the effect of these fluctuations we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage our foreign currency exposure to the fluctuations of certain foreign currencies the use of these instruments primarily helps to manage our exposure to our foreign purchase commitments and better control our product costs we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposesforeign currency exchange riskwe are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency exchange contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less and are consistent with the related purchase commitments to manage our exposure to the changes in the value of the euro and the canadian dollar these contracts are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability and are derivative contracts to hedge cash flow risks certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes while certain of these contracts currently a relatively small portion are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes accordingly the changes in the fair value of the majority of these contracts at the balance sheet date are recorded in our equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and upon maturity settlement are recorded in or reclassified into our cost of sales or operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as applicable to the transactions for which the forward currency exchange contracts were established for those contracts which are designated as hedges for accounting purposes any portion of those contracts deemed ineffective would be charged to earnings in the period the ineffectiveness was determinedwe perform a sensitivity analysis on our forward currency contracts both designated and not designated as hedges for accounting purposes to determine the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for this sensitivity analysis we assume a hypothetical change in us dollar against foreign exchange rates based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of april 1 2017 a 10 appreciation or devaluation of the us dollar compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of april 1 2017 would result in a net increase and decrease respectively of approximately 157 million in the fair value of these contractsinterest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk in relation to borrowings outstanding under our 2015 credit facility and our hong kong credit facility our 2015 credit facility carries interest rates that are tied to libor and the prime rate among other institutional lending rates depending on the particular origination of borrowing as further described in note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements our hong kong credit facility carries interest at a rate that is tied to the hong kong interbank offered rate therefore our statements of operations and comprehensive income and cash flows are exposed to changes in those interest rates at april 1 2017 we had shortterm borrowings of 1273 million outstanding under our 2015 credit facility and shortterm borrowings of approximately 58 million outstanding under our hong kong credit facility at april 2 2016 there were no balances outstanding on our 2015 credit facility these balances are not indicative of future balances that may be outstanding under our revolving credit facilities that may be subject to fluctuations in interest rates any increases in the applicable interest rates would cause an increase to the interest expense relative to any outstanding

or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable the companys impairment testing is based on its best estimate of its future operating cash flows if the sum of estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the assets carrying value an impairment charge is recognized which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flowsgoodwill the company performs an assessment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the businessthe company may assess its goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach step zero to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is greater than its carrying value if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value a quantitative goodwill analysis would be performed to determine if impairment is required the company may also elect to perform a quantitative analysis of goodwill initially rather than using a qualitative approach the valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment discounted cash flow and market multiples method require the companys management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of the companys reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the company would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value to compute the implied fair value the company would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill the company would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things the companys business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill may be impairedthere were no impairment charges related to goodwill in any of the fiscal periods presented see note 11 for information relating to the companys annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017insurance the company uses a combination of insurance and selfinsurance for losses related to a number of risks including workers compensation and employeerelated health care benefits the company

estimates of the discounted cost for selfinsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions historical loss experience actual payroll and other data although the company believes that it can reasonably estimate losses related to these claims actual results could differ from these estimates the company also maintains other types of customary business insurance policies including business interruption insurance insurance recoveries represent gain contingencies and are recorded upon actual settlement with the insurance carrier during fiscal 2017 the company received an insurance

shares units rsus and performance rsus these fair values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures based on expected attainment of preestablished performance goals for performance grants or the passage of time for those grants which have only timebased vesting requirements63table of contentsthe companys expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the companys estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for performancebased options is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years which directly correlates to the companys service period requirement for such options the expected holding period for timebased options is calculated using the simplified method which uses the vesting term of the options generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in a holding period of 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys estimated holding period as prior to december 2011 the company was privately held and there is insufficient historical option exercise experience the riskfree interest rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve based on the grants estimated holding period determining the grant date fair value of sharebased awards requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term and riskfree rate if factors change and the company employs different assumptions the fair value of future awards and the resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what the company has estimated in the pastforeign currency translation and transactionsthe financial statements of the majority of the companys foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency the companys functional currency is the united states dollar usd for mkhl and its united states based

comprehensive incomederivative financial instrumentsthe company uses forward currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain transactions the company in its normal course of business enters into transactions with foreign suppliers and seeks to minimize risks related to these transactions the company employs these forward currency contracts to hedge the companys cash flows as they relate to foreign currency transactions certain of these contracts are designated as hedges for accounting purposes while others remain undesignated all of the companys derivative instruments are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a gross basis regardless of their hedge designationthe company designates certain contracts related to the purchase of inventory that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges formal hedge documentation is prepared for all derivative instruments designated as hedges including description of the hedged item and the hedging instrument the risk being hedged and the manner in which hedge effectiveness will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively the effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item effects earnings when the inventory related to forecasted inventory purchases that are being hedged is sold to a third party the gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized within cost of goods sold the company uses regression analysis to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that are designated as hedges which compares the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the change in the related hedged item effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis and any portion of the designated hedge contracts deemed ineffective is recorded to foreign currency gain loss if the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in the future future changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings for those contracts that are not designated as hedges changes in the fair value are recorded to foreign currency gain loss in the companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income the company classifies cash flows relating to its derivative instruments consistently with the classification of the hedged item within cash flows from operating activitiesthe company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors adhering to established limits for credit exposure the aforementioned forward contracts generally have a term of no more than 12 months the period of these contracts is

market data obtained from independent sources unobservable inputs are inputs based on a companys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available
