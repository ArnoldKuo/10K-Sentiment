manufacturing contractors whereby the manufacturing contractor is generally responsible for the entire manufacturing process including the purchase of piece goods and trim although we do not have written agreements with any of our manufacturing contractors we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them we allocate product manufacturing among thirdparty agents based on their capabilities the availability of production capacity pricing and delivery we have relationships with various agents who source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf although our relationships with our agents are generally terminable at any time we believe we have mutually satisfactory relationships with them in fiscal 2015 and 2014 one thirdparty agent sourced approximately 117 and 126 of our finished goods purchases respectively in fiscal 2015 by dollar volume approximately 978 of our products were produced in asia and europe see item 1a  import restrictions and other government regulations and risk factors we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal

by the company ii assigned to the company to the extent not already assigned to and owned by the company exclusive worldwide rights in perpetuity to the michael kors name and trademark and all

and we believe that our relations with our employees are good  competition  we face intense competition in the product lines and markets in which we compete our products compete with other branded products within their product category in varying degrees depending on the product category involved we compete on the basis of style price customer service quality brand prestige and recognition among other bases in our wholesale business we compete with numerous manufacturers importers and distributors of accessories footwear and apparel for the limited space available for product display moreover the general availability of manufacturing contractors allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business  over the last several years the accessories category in particular has grown encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors we believe however that we have significant competitive advantages because of our brand recognition and the acceptance of our brand name by consumers see item 1a risk factors  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within north america and internationally and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline  seasonality  we experience certain effects of seasonality with respect to our wholesale and retail segments our wholesale segment generally experiences its greatest sales in our third and fourth fiscal quarters while our first fiscal quarter experiences the lowest sales our retail segment generally experiences greater sales during our third fiscal quarter as a result of holiday season sales in the aggregate our first fiscal quarter typically experiences significantly less sales volume relative to the other three quarters and our third fiscal quarter generally has higher sales volume relative to other three quarters however given our recent growth the effects of any seasonality are further muted by incremental sales related to our new retail stores wholesale doors and shopinshops

impact our consolidated results of operations in addition we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our nonus subsidiaries which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity as a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note we continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries foreign currencydenominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates however we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  as a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the us we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates particularly the euro the british pound the japanese yen and the canadian dollar a substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the us in addition our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices  we face risks associated with operating in international markets and our strategy to continue to expand internationally  we operate on a global basis with approximately 262 of our total revenue from operations outside of the us during fiscal 2015 as a result we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally including political and economic instability in foreign countries laws regulations and policies of foreign governments potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies political or civil unrest acts of terrorism military actions or other conditions economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations we also sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins depending on geographic region due to a variety of factors including product mix store size occupancy costs labor costs and retail pricing changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues increased costs and negatively impact our business financial condition and operating results  we face additional risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally including our efforts to further grow and expand our operations in europe and asia specifically during the second half of fiscal 2016 we plan to transition the currently licensed business in south korea to a wholly owned operation we may not be able to successfully integrate the business of any licensee that we acquire into our own business or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration furthermore we may have difficulty integrating any new or reacquired businesses into our operations hiring and retaining qualified key employees or otherwise successfully managing such expansion in some of the countries we do not yet have significant operating experience and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations many countries have different operational characteristics including but not limited to employment and labor transportation logistics real estate including lease terms and local reporting or legal requirements furthermore    11    table of contents  consumer demand and behavior as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and as a result sales of our product may not be successful or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate in addition in many of these countries there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  the growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our growth strategies including our efforts to open and operate new retail stores to increase the number of department stores and specialty stores that sell our products and to acquire select operations from our thirdparty licensees  as part of our growth strategy we intend to open and operate new retail stores and shopinshops within select department stores both domestically and internationally our ability to successfully open and operate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops depends on many factors including among others our ability to            identify new markets where our products and brand image will be accepted or the performance of our retail stores including concessions and shopinshops will be considered successful            negotiate acceptable lease terms including desired tenant improvement allowances to secure suitable store locations            hire train and retain personnel and field management            assimilate new personnel and field management into our corporate culture            source sufficient inventory levels and            successfully integrate new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops into our existing operations and information technology systems  we will encounter preopening costs and we may encounter initial losses when new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops commence operations certain of our european stores require investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees while we expect to open a number of additional retail stores including concessions and shopinshops in the future there can be no assurance that we will open the planned number that we will recover the expenditure costs associated with opening these new retail stores including concessions and shopinshops or that the operation of these new venues will be successful or profitable any changes from our initial expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  a material disruption in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  we rely extensively on our information technology it systems to track inventory manage our supply chain record and process transactions manage customer communications summarize results and manage our business the failure of our it systems to operate properly or effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or difficulty in integrating new systems could adversely affect our business in addition we have an ecommerce website in the united states a new ecommerce site in canada launched in april 2015 and plans for additional ecommerce sites in europe and japan in fiscal 2017 our it systems and websites may be subject to damage andor interruption from power outages computer network and telecommunications failures computer viruses hackers security breaches usage errors by our employees and bad acts by our customers and website visitors if our it systems or websites are damaged or cease to function properly we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer loss of critical data including our customer data and interruptions or delays in our operations in the interim any significant disruption in our it systems or websites could harm our reputation and credibility and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities if one or more of our distribution facilities experiences operational difficulties or becomes inoperable it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we operate a limited number of distribution facilities our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale customers and our own retail stores and ecommerce sites depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities if any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory andor disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers for example during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 our us third party operated ecommerce fulfillment center was impacted by structural damage which resulted in shipping delays to consumers who ordered merchandise through our ecommerce website in addition we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility any of the foregoing factors could result in decreased sales and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    12    table of contents in addition we have been moving into new and larger facilities as needed to increase our capacity as we grow and have been concurrently implementing new warehouse management systems to further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility there are risks inherent in operating in new distribution environments and implementing new warehouse management systems including operational difficulties that may arise with such transitions we may experience shipping delays should there be any disruptions in our new warehouse management systems or warehouses themselves  the markets in which we operate are highly competitive both within north america and internationally and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability to decline  we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign accessories footwear and apparel producers and retailers including among others coach burberry ralph lauren hermès louis vuitton gucci marc jacobs chloé tori burch and prada competition is based on a number of factors including without limitation the following            anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner            establishing and maintaining favorable brandname recognition            determining and maintaining product quality            maintaining key employees            maintaining and growing market share            developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers            establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers            pricing products appropriately            providing appropriate service and support to retailers            optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities            determining size and location of retail and department store selling space and            protecting intellectual property  in addition some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial technological manufacturing sales marketing and distribution resources than we do their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories footwear and apparel industries compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products the general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business any increased competition or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors could result in reduced sales which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  competition along with other factors such as consolidation changes in consumer spending patterns and a highly promotional environment could also result in significant pricing pressure these factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels andor otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs if our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses our profitability may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  the departure of our founder members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business   we depend on the services and management experience of our founder and executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business in particular mr kors our honorary chairman and chief creative officer has provided design and executive leadership to the company since its inception he is instrumental to our marketing and publicity strategy and is closely identified with both the brand that bears his name and our company in general our ability to maintain our brand image and leverage the goodwill associated with mr kors name may be damaged if we were to lose his services mr kors has the right to terminate his employment with us without cause in addition the leadership of john d idol our chairman and chief executive officer and joseph b parsons our executive vice president chief financial officer chief operating officer and treasurer has been a critical element of our success we also depend on other key employees involved in our licensing design and advertising operations competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees although we have entered into employment agreements with mr kors and certain of our other executive officers including mr idol and mr parsons we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future the loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to or relating to the loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    13    table of contents we have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations if we are unable to manage our operations at our current size or are unable to manage any future growth effectively our brand image and financial performance may suffer  we have expanded our operations rapidly and have limited operating experience at our current size if our operations continue to grow we will be required to continue to expand our sales and marketing product development and distribution functions to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and to obtain more space for our expanding administrative support and other headquarter personnel our continued growth could strain our existing resources and we could experience operating difficulties including the availability of desirable locations and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms difficulties in hiring training and managing an increasing number of employees difficulties in obtaining sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products and delays in production and shipments these difficulties could result in the erosion of our brand image and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  as we expand our store base we may be unable to maintain the same comparable store sales or average sales per square foot that we have in the past which could cause our share price to decline  as we expand our store base we may not be able to maintain the levels of comparable store sales that we have experienced historically in addition we may not be able to maintain our historic average sales per square foot as we move into new markets if our future comparable store sales or average sales per square foot decline or fail to meet market expectations the price of our ordinary shares could decline in addition the aggregate results of operations of our stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future a variety of factors affect both comparable store sales and average sales per square foot including among others fashion trends competition current economic conditions pricing inflation the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events changes in our merchandise mix the success of marketing programs and weather conditions if we misjudge the market for our products we may incur excess inventory for some of our products and miss opportunities for other products these factors may cause our comparable store sales results and average sales per square foot in the future to be materially lower than recent periods and our expectations which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and result in a decline in the price of our ordinary shares  we are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space under longterm noncancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases any failure to make these lease payments when due could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results  we do not own any of our store facilities instead we lease all of our stores under operating leases our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years our leases generally require a fixed annual rent and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount certain of our european stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees generally our leases are net leases which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance taxes maintenance and utilities we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs for example as of march 28 2015 we were party to operating leases associated with our stores as well as other corporate facilities requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to 8974 million through fiscal 2020 and approximately 6953 million thereafter through fiscal 2029 we expect that any new stores we open under operating leases will have terms similar to those contained in leases we have entered previously which will further increase our operating lease expenses  our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences including among others            increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions            limiting our ability to obtain additional financing            requiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations thus reducing cash available for other purposes            limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete and            placing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors    14    table of contents we depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses grow our business respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs  our current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control  we have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell under our trademarks products requiring specialized expertise we have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas such as the middle east eastern europe latin america the caribbean throughout all of asia excluding japan and australia in addition we have entered into similar licensing agreements with entities that are indirectly owned by certain of our directors and officers including michael kors and john idol pursuant to which we have granted such entities certain rights to distribute and sell our products in china hong kong macau and taiwan see note 19  agreements with shareholders and related party transactions to the accompanying consolidated audited financial statements in the future we may enter into additional licensing arrangements although we take steps to carefully select our licensing partners such arrangements may not be successful our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own such as the timing of new store openings the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products in addition the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business including risks associated with each such partners ability to           obtain capital            exercise operational and financial control over its business            manage its labor relations            maintain relationships with suppliers            manage its credit and bankruptcy risks and            maintain customer relationships  any of the foregoing risks or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements  we rely on our licensing partners to preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through among other things approval rights over store location and design product design production quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our stores and products we may not be able to control the use by our licensing partners of our brand the misuse of our brand by a licensing partner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue  a small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our net sales net sales to our five largest wholesale customers represented 263 of our total revenue for fiscal 2015 and 289 of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 our largest wholesale customer federated accounted for 137 of our total revenue for fiscal 2015 and 144 of our total revenue for fiscal 2014 we do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an orderbyorder basis a decision by any of our major wholesale customers whether motivated by marketing strategy competitive conditions financial difficulties or otherwise to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability during the past several years the retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes and we expect such changes will continue in addition store closings by our wholesale customers decrease the number of stores carrying our products while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products andor may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands in the future retailers may further consolidate undergo restructurings or reorganizations realign their affiliations or reposition their stores target markets any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry these changes could decrease our opportunities in the market increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results    15    table of contents increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer  the costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by among other things weather consumer demand speculation on the commodities market the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control we are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials the ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent thirdparty agents to source our finished goods which poses legal regulatory political and economic risks to our business operations  our products are primarily produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in asia and europe a manufacturing contractors failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items the failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices any of which could have a material adverse effect on us in addition any of the following factors could negatively affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results            political or labor instability labor shortages stemming from labor disputes or otherwise or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located            significant delays or disruptions in delivery of our products due to labor disputes or strikes at the location of the source of our goods andor at us ports of entry            political or military conflict involving the united states which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials and increase transportation costs            heightened terrorism security concerns which could subject imported or exported goods to additional more frequent or more thorough inspections leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods of time or could result in increased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods leading to lost sales increased costs for our anticounterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands            a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials            disease epidemics and healthrelated concerns which could result in closed factories reduced workforces scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas            the migration and development of manufacturing contractors which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced            imposition of regulations quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations which among other things could limit our ability to produce products in costeffective countries that have the labor and expertise needed            increases in the costs of fuel travel and transportation            imposition of duties taxes and other charges on imports            significant fluctuation of the value of the united states dollar against foreign currencies and            restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located  we do not have written agreements with any of our thirdparty manufacturing contractors as a result any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time in fiscal 2015 our largest manufacturing contractor who primarily produces its products in china and who we have worked with for over ten years accounted for the production of 291 of our finished products our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and costefficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and impact the cost and availability of our goods    16    table of contents in addition we use thirdparty agents to source our finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on our behalf any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time in fiscal 2015 our largest thirdparty agent whose primary place of business is hong kong and who we have worked with for over 10 years sourced approximately 117 of our purchases of finished goods our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and costefficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  if we fail to comply with labor laws or if our manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable ethical business practices our business and reputation could suffer  we are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees including minimum wage requirements overtime working conditions and citizenship requirements compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation  in addition we require our manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws rules and regulations regarding working conditions employment practices and environmental compliance additionally we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those three areas in order to promote ethical business practices and our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our manufacturing contractors to determine compliance however we do not control our manufacturing contractors or their labor and other business practices if one of our manufacturing contractors violates applicable labor or other laws rules or regulations or implements labor or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical in the united states the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted orders could be cancelled relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  our business is subject to risks associated with importing products  there are risks inherent to importing our products virtually all of our merchandise imported into the united states canada europe and asia is subject to duties and most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption the united states and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported at unfairly traded prices that in such increased quantities cause or threaten injury to the relevant domestic industry generally known as antidumping actions if dumping is suspected in the united states the united states government may selfinitiate a dumping case on behalf of a particular industry furthermore additional duties generally known as countervailing duties can also be imposed by the united states government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a united states industry in addition accessories footwear and apparel sold by us are also subject to import regulations in the united states and other countries concerning the use of wildlife products for commercial and noncommercial trade including the us fish and wildlife service fampw fampw requires that we obtain a license to import animal and fauna that are subject to regulation by fampw and can revoke or refuse to renew this license seize and possibly destroy our shipments andor fine the company for fampw violations the imposition of duties and quotas the initiation of an antidumping action andor the repercussions of fampw violations could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results  we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights and others may allege that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights  our trademarks including michael kors and michael michael kors logos and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position we are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights in the united states europe the middle east the far east and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels our brand enjoys significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of our products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters to infringe on our brand we work with customs authorities law enforcement legal representatives and brand specialists globally in an effort to prevent the sale of counterfeit michael kors products but we cannot guarantee the extent to which our efforts to prevent counterfeiting of our brand and other intellectual property infringement will be successful such counterfeiting and other infringement could dilute our brand and harm our reputation and business  our trademark applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or provide the scope of coverage sought and others may seek to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of their trademarks and intellectual property rights in addition others may assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in trademarks that    17    table of

have prior rights to our trademarks or similar trademarks furthermore certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks and other intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we become involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks similar to some of our brands any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights or any allegation that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could be costly and timeconsuming and could result if determined adversely to us in harm to our competitive position  restrictive covenants in our credit agreement may restrict our ability to pursue our business

things asset dispositions mergers and acquisitions dividends share repurchases and redemptions other restricted payments indebtedness loans and investments liens and affiliate transactions our credit agreement also contains customary events of default including a change in control of the company in addition our credit agreement contains financial covenants such as requiring an adjusted leverage ratio of 35 to 10 with the ratio being total consolidated indebtedness plus 80 times consolidated rent expense to ebitda plus consolidated rent expense and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 20 to 10 with the ratio being ebitda plus consolidated rent expense to the sum of fixed charges plus consolidated rent expense see credit discussion in managements discussion and analysis of financial

or development activities or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on debt  failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares  as a public company we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act if our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence which could have an adverse effect on our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares  provisions in our organizational documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party  our memorandum and articles of association together as amended from time to time our memorandum and articles contains several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors these provisions also may delay prevent or deter a merger acquisition tender offer proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares these provisions include among others            our board of directors ability to amend the memorandum and articles to create and issue from time to time one or more classes of preference shares and with respect to each such class to fix the terms thereof by resolution            provisions relating to the multiple

of directors            restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call meetings and bring proposals before meetings            elimination of the ability of shareholders to act by written consent and            the requirement of the affirmative vote of 75 of the shares entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our memorandum and articles  these provisions of our memorandum and articles could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares    18    table of contents rights of shareholders under british virgin islands law differ from those under united states law and accordingly our shareholders may have fewer protections  our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles the bvi business companies act 2004 as amended the bvi act and the common law of the british virgin islands the rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the british virgin islands and by the bvi act the common law of the british virgin islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the british virgin islands as well as from english common law which has persuasive but not binding authority on a court in the british virgin islands the rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under british virgin islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the united states in particular the british virgin islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and some states such as delaware have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law as a result of the foregoing holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a us company  the laws of the british virgin islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs  under the laws of the british virgin islands there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the bvi act dealing with shareholder remedies as summarized under item 10  additional information  memorandum and articles of association the principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a british virgin islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the company conducted in accordance with the bvi act and the memorandum and articles of association of the company as such if those who control the company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the bvi act or the provisions of the companys memorandum and articles of association then the courts will likely grant relief generally the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following i an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority ii acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the company iii acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders such as the right to vote and iv acts where the company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the united states  it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the united states  under our memorandum and articles we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them subject to limited exceptions furthermore to the extent allowed by law the rights and obligations among or between us any of our current or former directors officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the british virgin islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the british virgin islands courts unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such although there is doubt as to whether united states courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the united states under united states securities laws these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the british virgin islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the british virgin islands or jurisdictions that would apply british virgin islands law  british virgin islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interests  british virgin islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the united states the circumstances in which any such action may be brought and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action may result in the rights of shareholders of a british virgin islands company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the united states accordingly shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred the british virgin islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the united states based on certain liability provisions of united states securities law or to impose liabilities in original actions brought in the british virgin islands based on certain liability provisions of the united states securities laws that are penal in nature there is no statutory recognition in the british virgin islands of judgments obtained in the united states although the courts of the british virgin islands will generally recognize and enforce the nonpenal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits this means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered    19    table of contents fluctuations in our tax obligations and changes in tax laws and regulations may have a material impact on our future effective tax rates and results of operations  our subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction as a result our overall effective tax rate is effected by the proportion of earnings from the various tax jurisdictions we record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions at any time there are multiple tax years that are subject to examinations by various taxing authorities the ultimate resolution of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement amount that differs from our original estimate in addition any proposed or future changes in tax laws and regulations or interpretations could have a material effect on our effective tax rates financial condition and results of operations  on march 26 2015 the united kingdom enacted new diverted profits tax legislation the dpt which is effective on

expenses capital resources new stores additional financings or borrowings and additional losses and are subject to risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those discussed in this report that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by these forwardlooking statements we also urge you to carefully review the risk factors set forth in item 1a  risk factors  overview  our business  we are a rapidly growing global luxury lifestyle brand led by a worldclass management team and a renowned awardwinning designer since launching his namesake brand over 30 years ago michael kors has featured distinctive designs materials and craftsmanship with a jetset aesthetic that combines stylish elegance and a sporty attitude mr kors vision has taken the company from its beginnings as an american luxury sportswear house to a global accessories footwear and apparel company with a presence in over 100 countries as a highly recognized luxury lifestyle brand in north america with accelerating awareness in targeted international markets we have experienced exceptional sales momentum and intend to continue along this course as we grow our business  we operate our business in three segmentsretail wholesale and licensingand we have a strategically controlled global distribution network focused on companyoperated retail stores leading department stores specialty stores and select licensing partners as of march 28 2015 our retail segment included 343 north american retail stores including concessions 183 international retail stores including concessions throughout europe and japan and our us ecommerce site as of march 28 2015 our wholesale segment included wholesale sales through approximately 2541 department store and specialty store doors in north america and wholesale sales through approximately 1497 specialty store and department store doors internationally our remaining revenue is generated through our licensing segment through which we license to third parties certain production sales andor distribution rights during fiscal 2015 our licensing segment accounted for approximately 39 of our total revenue and consisted of royalties earned on licensed products and our geographic licenses  we offer two primary collections the michael kors luxury collection and the michael michael kors accessible luxury collection the michael kors collection establishes the aesthetic authority of our entire brand and is carried by many of our retail stores as well as in the finest luxury department stores in the world in 2004 we introduced the michael michael kors collection which has a strong focus on accessories in addition to offering footwear and apparel and addresses the significant demand opportunity in accessible luxury goods taken together our two collections target a broad customer base while retaining a premium luxury image  trends and uncertainties  disruptions in shipping and distribution our operations are subject to the impact of shipping disruptions as a result of changes or damage to our distribution infrastructure as well as due to external factors during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 our us third party operated ecommerce fulfillment center was impacted by structural damage which resulted in shipping delays to consumers who ordered merchandise through our ecommerce website in addition we were impacted by the work slowdowns and stoppages resulting from the labor dispute at the us west coast ports during our fiscal 2015 which created a backlog of containers at the ports and resulted in inventory delivery delays we may continue to experience inventory delivery delays until this backlog is cleared by the ports we also experienced disruptions in shipping of our products within the us during the second quarter of fiscal 2014 as a result of implementing new material handling equipment and systems for purposes of automating our california distribution facility which negatively impacted our ability to ship at full capacity during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 in addition to delivery delays incremental expenses related to the above disruptions were incurred throughout the related time periods these disruptions to our shipping have had a negative impact on our net sales operating expenses and net income for fiscal 2015 and 2014 and any future disruptions could have a negative impact on our results of operations  currency fluctuation and the strengthening us dollar our consolidated operations are impacted by the relationships between our reporting currency the us dollar and those of our nonus subsidiaries whose functionallocal currency is other than    24    table of contents  the us dollar the recent decline in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar has impacted the conversion of the results of our european operations as they are reported which represent approximately 20 of our consolidated revenue at march 28 2015 the euro experienced an approximate 21 decline in value relative to the us dollar compared to the same time in the prior year and we believe that this trend may continue in fiscal 2016 our results have also been negatively impacted by an approximate 12 yearoveryear decline in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar  costs of manufacturing our industry is subject to volatility in costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products this volatility applies primarily to costs driven by commodity prices which can increase or decrease dramatically over a short period of time these fluctuations may have a material impact on our sales results of operations and cash flows to the extent they occur we use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate these effects by sourcing our products as efficiently as possible in addition manufacturing labor costs are also subject to degrees of volatility based on local and global economic conditions we use commercially reasonable efforts to source from localities that suit our manufacturing standards and result in more favorable labor driven costs to our products  establishing brand identity and enhancing global presence we intend to continue to increase our international presence and global brand recognition through the formation of various joint ventures with international partners and continuing with our international licensing arrangements we feel this is an efficient method for continued penetration into the global luxury goods market especially for markets where we have yet to establish a substantial presence  demand for our accessories and related merchandise our performance is affected by trends in the luxury goods industry as well as shifts in demographics and changes in lifestyle preferences currently we expect that the demand for our products will continue to grow as the demand for the worldwide luxury goods industry and accessories in particular is predicted to experience continued growth we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the continued growth of the accessories product category as it is one of our primary product categories of focus  critical accounting policies  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period critical accounting policies are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult subjective and complex judgments to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain in applying such policies we must use certain assumptions that are based upon our informed judgments assessments of probability and best estimates estimates by their nature are subjective and are based upon analysis of available information including historical factors current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis while our significant accounting policies are detailed in note 2 to the accompanying audited financial statements our critical accounting policies are discussed below and pertain to revenue recognition inventories impairment of longlived assets goodwill sharebased compensation derivatives and income taxes  revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred the price has been fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we recognize retail store revenue upon sale of our products to retail consumers net of estimated returns revenue from sales through our ecommerce site is recognized at the time of delivery to the customer reduced by an estimate of returns wholesale revenue is recognized net of estimates for sales returns discounts markdowns and allowances after merchandise is shipped and title and risk of loss are transferred to our wholesale customers to arrive at net sales for retail gross sales are reduced by actual customer returns as well as by a provision for estimated future customer returns which is based on managements review of historical and current customer returns the amounts reserved for retail sales returns were 25 million 23 million and 31 million at march 28 2015 march 29 2014 and march 30 2013 respectively to arrive at net sales for wholesale gross sales are reduced by provisions for estimated future returns based on current expectations as well as trade discounts markdowns allowances operational chargebacks and certain cooperative selling expenses total sales reserves for wholesale were 875 million 659 million and 430 million at march 28 2015 march 29 2014 and march 30 2013 respectively these estimates are based on such factors as historical trends actual and forecasted performance and market conditions which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis our historical estimates of these costs were not materially different from actual results  as of march 28 2015 a hypothetical 1 increase in allowances for our reserves for sales returns discounts markdowns and other allowances would have decreased our fiscal 2015 revenues by less than 1 million  royalty revenue generated from product licenses which includes contributions for advertising is based on reported sales of licensed products bearing our tradenames at rates specified in the license agreements these agreements are also subject to contractual minimum levels royalty revenue generated by geographyspecific licensing agreements is recognized as it is earned under the licensing agreements based on reported sales of licensees applicable to specified periods as outlined in the agreements these agreements allow for the use of our tradenames to sell our branded products in specific geographic regions    25    table of contents inventories  our inventory costs include amounts paid to independent manufacturers plus duties and freight to bring the goods to the companys warehouses which are located in the united states holland canada japan and hong kong we continuously evaluate the composition of our inventory and make adjustments when the cost of inventory is not expected to be fully recoverable the net realizable value of our inventory is estimated based on historical experience current and forecasted demand and market conditions in addition reserves for inventory loss are estimated based on historical experience and physical inventory counts our inventory reserves are estimates which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions customer demand or competition differ from expectations our historical estimates of these adjustments have not differed materially from actual results  longlived assets  we evaluate all longlived assets including fixed assets and finitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable for the purposes of impairment testing we group our longlived assets according to their lowest level of use such as aggregating and capitalizing all construction costs related to a retail store into leasehold improvements and those related to our wholesale business into shopinshops our leasehold improvements are typically amortized over the life of the store lease including highly probable renewals and our shopinshops are amortized over a useful life of three or four years our impairment testing is based on our best estimate of the future operating cash flows if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is less than the assets carrying value we recognize an impairment charge which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future volume sales and expense growth rates devaluation and inflation as such these estimates may differ from actual cash flows and future impairments may result if actual cash flows are lower than our expectations for fiscal 2015 fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 we recorded charges for impairments on fixed assets related to our retail segment of 08 million 13 million and 07 million respectively  goodwill  we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill on an annual basis or whenever impairment indicators exist in the absence of any impairment indicators goodwill is assessed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year these assessments are made with regards to reporting units within our wholesale and licensing segments where our goodwill is recorded and are based on our current operating projections judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business  we assess our goodwill for impairment initially using a qualitative approach step zero to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill is greater than its carrying value if the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying value a quantitative goodwill analysis would be performed to determine if impairment is required the valuation methods used in the quantitative fair value assessment discounted cash flow and market multiples methods require our management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value to compute the implied fair value we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value the valuation of goodwill is affected by among other things our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations future events could cause us to conclude the impairment indicators exist and therefore that goodwill may be impaired  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 we performed our annual impairment analysis using a qualitative approach based on the results of this assessment we concluded that the carrying amounts of all reporting units were significantly exceeded by their respective fair values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment there were no impairment charges related to goodwill in any of the fiscal periods presented    26    table of contents sharebased compensation  we grant sharebased awards to certain of our employees and directors the grant date fair value of share options is calculated using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires us to use subjective assumptions the closing market price at the grant date is used to determine the grant date fair value of restricted shares restricted share units and performance restricted share units these values are recognized as expense over the requisite service period net of estimated forfeitures based on expected attainment of preestablished performance goals for performance grants or the passage of time for those grants which have only timebased vesting requirements  our expected volatility is based on the average volatility rates of similar actively traded companies over the past 4595 years which is our range of estimated expected holding periods the expected holding period for performancebased options is based on the period to expiration which is generally 910 years this approach was chosen as it directly correlates to our service period the expected holding period for timebased options is calculated using a simplified method which uses the vesting term of the options generally 4 years and the contractual term of 7 years resulting in holding periods of 45475 years the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the companys estimated holding period as prior to december 2011 the company was privately held and as such there is insufficient historical option exercise experience the riskfree rate is derived from the zerocoupon us treasury strips yield curve based on the grants estimated holding period determining the grant date fair value of sharebased awards requires considerable judgment including estimating expected volatility expected term riskfree rate and forfeitures if factors change and we employ different assumptions the fair value of future awards and resulting sharebased compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have estimated in the past  derivative financial instruments  we use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency for certain of our transactions we are exposed to risks on certain purchase commitments to foreign suppliers based on the value of our purchasing subsidiaries local currency relative to the currency requirement of the supplier on the date of the commitment as such we enter into forward currency contracts that generally mature in 12 months or less which is consistent with the related purchase commitments we designate certain contracts related to the purchase of inventory that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges while others remain undesignated all of our derivative instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a gross basis regardless of their hedge designation the effective portion of changes in the fair value for contracts designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item effects earnings when the inventory related to forecasted inventory purchases that are being hedged is sold to a third party the gains or losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are recognized within cost of goods sold we use regression analysis to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that are designated as hedges which compares the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to the change in the related hedged item effectiveness is assessed on a quarterly basis and any portion of the designated hedge contracts deemed ineffective is recorded to other income if the hedge is no longer expected to be highly effective in the future future changes in the fair value are recognized in earnings for those contracts that are not designated as hedges changes in the fair value are recorded in other income in our consolidated statements of operations  the company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations in order to mitigate counterparty credit risk the company only enters into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and certain other financial factors adhering to established limits for credit exposure  income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of our assets and liabilities and are determined using the tax rates and laws in effect for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities based on the results of local state federal or foreign statutory tax audits or our own estimates and judgments  realization of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to their expiration in the applicable tax jurisdiction we periodically review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and provide valuation allowances as deemed necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that morelikelythannot will be realized this determination involves considerable judgment and our management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets including recent earnings results within various taxing jurisdictions expectations of future taxable income the carryforward periods remaining and other factors changes in the required valuation allowance are recorded in income in the period such determination is made deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if our estimates of taxable income during the carryforward period are significantly reduced or alternative tax strategies are no longer viable    27    table of contents we recognize the impact of an uncertain income tax position taken on our income tax returns at the largest amount that is morelikelythannot to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority the effect of an uncertain income tax position will not be taken into account if the position has less than a 50 likelihood of being sustained our tax positions are analyzed periodically at least quarterly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense  recent accounting pronouncements  we have considered all new accounting pronouncements and other than the recent pronouncements discussed below have concluded that there are no new pronouncements that have a material impact on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows based on current information  in june 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201412 accounting for sharebased payments when the terms of an award provide that a performance target could be achieved after the requisite service period asu 201412 requires that a performance target under stockbased compensation arrangements that could be achieved after the service period is treated as a performance condition and not reflected in the grantdate fair value of the award rather the related compensation cost should be recognized when it becomes probable that the performance targets will be achieved asu 201412 is effective beginning with our fiscal 2017 with early adoption and retrospective application permitted we do not expect that asu 201412 will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  in may 2014 the fasb issued asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers which provides new guidance for revenues recognized from contracts with customers and will replace the existing revenue recognition guidance asu no 201409 requires that revenue is recognized at an amount the company is entitled to upon transferring control of goods or services to customers as opposed to when risks and rewards transfer to a customer asu no 201409 will become effective for the interim reporting periods within the annual reporting period beginning after december 15 2016 or beginning with our fiscal 2018 and may be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented or retrospectively with a cumulative adjustment to retained earnings in the year of adoption in april 2015 the fasb issued a proposal to defer the effective date by one year which if approved would make this standard effective beginning in our fiscal 2019 we are currently evaluating the adoption method and the impact that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  segment information  we generate revenue through three business segments

a percentage of net retail sales of approximately 26 as well as due to the decrease in gross profit margin as previously discussed above during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales was largely due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to new stores and lease rights key money as well as

approximately 60 to 518 this decrease as a percentage of licensing revenue was due to an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of licensing revenues during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal

during fiscal 2015  other income  other income was 31 million during fiscal 2015 and was comprised of the following 15 million in income related to our anticounterfeiting efforts an unrealized gain of

recognized a foreign currency loss of 41 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to a foreign currency loss of 01 million during fiscal 2014 the fiscal 2015 loss was primarily related to the

to the euro and the canadian dollar which impacted the remeasurement of dollardenominated intercompany loans with certain of our subsidiaries the 01 million loss for fiscal 2014 was primarily related

million of income tax expense during fiscal 2015 compared with 3462 million for fiscal 2014 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 298 compared to 344 for fiscal 2014 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the increase in taxable income in certain of our nonus subsidiaries predominantly european operations during fiscal 2015 which are subject to lower statutory income tax rates given that certain of our nonus operations have become consistently profitable we expect this impact on our combined consolidated effective rate to continue the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the settlement of certain financial instruments in connection with our international income tax structuring  our effective tax rate may fluctuate from time to time due to the effects of changes in us state and local taxes and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions in addition factors such as the geographic mix of earnings enacted tax legislation and the results of various global tax strategies may also impact our effective tax rate in future periods  net income  as a result of the foregoing our net income increased 2195 million or 332 to 8810 million during

percentage of net retail sales to 293 during fiscal 2014 the decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to an approximately 06 increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales offset in part by the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net retail sales discussed above the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net retail sales resulted from an increase in rent on our stores as a percentage of net retail sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  wholesale  income from operations for our wholesale segment increased 1905 million or 707 to 4598 million during fiscal 2014 compared to 2693 million for fiscal 2013 income from operations as a percentage of net wholesale sales for the wholesale segment increased approximately 30 as a percentage of net wholesale sales to 291 this increase was primarily due to the aforementioned increase in gross profit margin as a percentage of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 in addition there was a decrease in operating expenses of approximately 12 as a percent of net wholesale sales during fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net wholesale sales resulted from the increase in our net wholesale sales during fiscal 2014 which grew at a greater rate relative to expenses and more than offset the additional expenses incurred during the period such as those discussed above in selling general and administrative expenses  licensing  income from operations for our licensing segment increased 361 million or 802 to 811 million during fiscal 2014 compared to 450 million for fiscal 2013 income from operations as a percentage of licensing revenue for the licensing segment increased approximately 6 as a percentage of revenue to 578 this increase is primarily the result of the aforementioned increase in sales licensing revenue which grew at a greater rate relative to operating expenses during fiscal 2014  interest expense net  interest expense net decreased 11 million or 742 to 04 million for fiscal 2014 as compared to 15 million for fiscal 2013 due primarily to a an increase in interest income earned on our shortterm investments cash equivalents during fiscal 2014 as well as a decrease in borrowing during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the primary components of interest expense during both fiscal 2014 and 2013 were commitment fees and amortization of deferred financing fees  foreign currency loss  we recognized a foreign currency loss of 01 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to a foreign currency loss of 14 million during fiscal 2013 the decrease in foreign currency loss during fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in the balances of our us dollar denominated intercompany loan balances with certain of our nonus subsidiaries whose functional currency was other than the us dollar which yield translation gains or losses during their remeasurement during fiscal 2013 the larger balances of these us dollar denominated intercompany loans were impacted by the us dollars strengthening against the yen during that period    37    table of contents provision for income taxes  we recognized 3462 million of income tax expense during fiscal 2014 compared with 2295 million for fiscal 2013 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 344 compared to 366 for fiscal 2013 the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted primarily due to a decrease in our us blended state income tax rate as well as a greater portion of our income being recognized in jurisdictions with lower statutory income tax rates during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  net income  as a result of the foregoing our net income increased 2639 million or 664 to 6615 million

table of contents cash provided by operating activities  cash provided by operating activities increased 2248 million to 8579 million during fiscal 2015 as compared to 6331 million for fiscal 2014 the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due an increase in our net income after noncash adjustments as well as a favorable change on our inventory primarily attributable to the sell through of our inventory relative to purchases made during fiscal 2015 these increases were partially offset by decreases related to changes in our accrued expenses and other current liabilities and accounts payable as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to timing of payments the decline related to accrued expenses and other current liabilities was also due to the payment of certain nonus current income tax liabilities during fiscal 2015  cash provided by operating activities increased 2693 million to 6331 million during fiscal 2014 as compared to 3638 million for fiscal 2013 the increase in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to an increase in our net income after noncash adjustments as well as an increase in changes to our accounts payable during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 these increases were offset in part by a decrease in changes to our accounts receivable and an increase in cash outflows on our inventory during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the increase in changes to our accounts payable was largely related to the increases in our inventory purchases the increase in cash outflows on our inventory occurred primarily due to the increase in our inventory requirements driven by our increased sales during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 the decrease in changes to our accounts receivable was directly related to the increase in our sales which drove the increase to our accounts receivable balances during fiscal 2014  cash used in investing activities  net cash used in investing activities was 3884 million during fiscal 2015 compared to net cash used in investing activities of 2155 million during fiscal 2014 the increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily the result of the buildout of our new

net cash provided by financing activities of 711 million during fiscal 2014 this decline in cash from financing activities was primarily attributable to increased cash payments of 4928 million in connection with the repurchase of our ordinary shares as well a 131 million decrease in proceeds from our share option arrangements  net cash provided by financing activities was 711 million during fiscal 2014 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1506 million during fiscal 2013 after excluding the noncash effects of tax benefits from the exercise of share options cash provided by financing activities increased by 103 million this increase was primarily due to the net repayments on our revolving credit facility of 227 million during fiscal 2013 this increase was offset in part by a decrease of 114 million in cash received from the exercise of employee share options during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013  revolving credit facilities  senior unsecured
