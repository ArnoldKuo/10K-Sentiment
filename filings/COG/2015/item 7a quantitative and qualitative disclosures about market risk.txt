market riskour primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictablederivative instruments and risk management activitiesour risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and only provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price 50table of contentsdeclines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activitiesperiodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar and swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futuresas of december 31 2014 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives

exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksduring 2014 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 360 to 437 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 422 to 480 per mcf covered 3368 bcf or 66 of natural gas production at an average price of 437 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1022 bcf or 20 of natural gas production at an average price of 406 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 612 mbbl or 17 of crude oil production at an average price of 9700 per bblwe are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see forwardlooking information for further detailsfair market value of other financial instrumentsthe estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instrumentsthe fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment 51table of contentsrisk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixed rate notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to uswe use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair values of debt are as follows december 31 2014 december 31 2013in thousandscarrying amount
