 natural gas and crude oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the first of the month henry hub index price were 430 per mmbtu in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 287 per mmbtu in february 2015 while oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 5929 per barrel in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 4733 per barrel in january 2015 substantial or extended decline in prices in the future would have a negative impact on our oil and gas reserves and financial results see recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the followingthe levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global natural gas supplythe level of consumer product demandweather conditionspolitical conditions or

consumption20table of contentsspeculation by investors in oil and natural gasvariations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices andoverall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currenciesthese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to scale back our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligationsdrilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activityour growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control includingunexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formationsequipment failures or accidentsadverse weather conditionsdecreases in natural gas and oil pricessurface access restrictionsloss of title or other title related issueslack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereofcompliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation including with respect to wastewater disposal discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing andcosts of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materialsour future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors includingthe results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic datathe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospectsthe approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiledeconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crewsour financial resources and results andthe availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permitsthese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil21table of contentsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understatedreserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same dataresults of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reservesyou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in generalrecent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operationsthe value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment because our reserves are predominately natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil priceswe evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the futureour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverablein general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically22table of contentsour reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2014 will increase at a rate of 9 during 2015 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 23 and 17 during 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typicalexploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserveswe have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at allwe rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenuesstrategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rateour future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2015 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2015 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectivesnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operationsnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our businessour ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processingthe sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our businessfor example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available 23table of contentsin such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing businessour operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20142016 national enforcement initiative ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilitiesacquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilitiessuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arisethere may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing propertiesthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operationsthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties includethe challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our businessthe inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesspotential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties andthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectationsthe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process 24table of contentswhich will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could sufferwe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial lossesour business involves a variety of operating risks includingwell site blowouts cratering and explosionsequipment failurespipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluidsuncontrolled flows of natural gas

could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to usour operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2014 we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenancewe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposedwe maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowswe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operateother companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2014 nonoperated wells represented approximately 92 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 32 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs25table of contentsterrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businessthe threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive positioncompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxationwe may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oilfrom time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectivelythe collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including whena counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligationsproduction is less than expected orthere is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our productionthe cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictablewe will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivativesthe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operateour operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could 26table of contentshave a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmedfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delaysmost of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in may 2013 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorgon august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves in december 2014 the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in january 2015 the epa announced plans to propose a rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from oil and natural gas completion operationscompliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our businessin addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 and new york announced the intention to create a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in december 2014 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania 27table of contentsdepartment of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids on december 19 2013 the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules the remaining challenges to act 13 were remanded to the state commonwealth court which dismissed those challenges in july 2014 this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the statewe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2015 the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposala number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in early 2015 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions for example in november 2014 the obama administration announced an agreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions to 26 to 28 of 2005 levels by 2025 further the united states joined over 190 countries in lima peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris france in 2015 in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions for example in june 2013 the obama administration announced its climate action plan which among other things directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions including emissions from the oil and gas sector pursuant to this plan the epa announced in january 2015 a plan to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants28table of contentsfederal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliablecertain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowssubstantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our businessprovisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investmentour charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directorsthe personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charterthe delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liabilityfor any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholdersfor acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of lawunder provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions andfor any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefitthis limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders29table of contents
