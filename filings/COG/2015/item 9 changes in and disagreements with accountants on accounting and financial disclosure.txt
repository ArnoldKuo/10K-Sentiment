one of three categories 1 tight sands 2 coal beds or 3 shales the reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps seals and discrete hydrocarbonwater boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs these reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to achieve economic flow ratesundeveloped reserves undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certaintyunproved properties properties with no proved reservesworking interest an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations5table of contentspart iitems 1 and 2 business and propertiescabot oil amp gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvaniastrategy our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy includedisciplined capital spending focused on organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows with any shortfalls funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost repeatable drilling opportunitieslow cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structureconservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and select asset salesexpand our unconventional resource initiatives we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including new exploration concepts and ideas that if successful can match the size scope and rate of returns of our existing core assets we will also consider the use of joint venture arrangements to achieve these objectives2015 outlookin 2015 we plan to spend approximately 9000 million on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 125 gross wells or 1150 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we expect to allocate approximately 59 of our 2015 capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 39 to our oilfocused play in the eagle ford shale and the remaining 2 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures due to the weak commodity price environment our overall capital and exploration spending in 2015 is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2014incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures program we also expect to contribute approximately 698 million to our equity method investments to fund costs associated with the development and construction of two natural gas pipelines in northeast pennsylvania see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade

northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united statesmarcellus shale our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent wyoming county pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2014 net production in the marcellus shale was 4798 bcfe representing approximately 90 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2014 we had a total of 4690 net wells in the marcellus shale the majority of which are operated by usduring 2014 we invested 9795 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 1144 net horizontal wells and turned in line 970 net wells as of december 31 2014 we had 473 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2014 with six drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2015 with three rigs operatingeagle ford shale our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio and la salle counties texas where we hold approximately 89000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2014 our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford shale was 3799 mbbl and 15 bcf respectively or 243 bcfe representing approximately 5 of our full year total equivalent production as of december 31 2014 we had a total of 1672 net wells in the eagle fordduring 2014 we invested 5424 million excluding acquisitions in the eagle ford shale and drilled or participated in drilling 612 net wells we also expanded our position in the play with the acquisition of certain proved and unproved properties for cash consideration of approximately 2147 million we exited 2014 with four drilling rigs operating in the play and plan to exit 2015 with one rig operatingother oil and gas properties in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the utica shale in pennsylvania the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia other properties ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and four local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2014 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our systemwe also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia7table of contentsacquisitionsin december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million subject to post closing adjustments

both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple marketswe also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or through the use of purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contractsto date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices8table of contentsrisk management from time to time we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreementduring 2014 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 360 to 437 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 422 to 480 per mcf covered 3368 bcf or 66 of our natural gas production at an average price of 437 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1022 bcf or 20 of our natural gas production at an average price of 406 per mcf crude

incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made 13table of contentsprior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped propertiescompetition competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resourcesmajor customers during the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 two customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 and three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily availableseasonalitydemand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter monthsregulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industrynatural gas marketing gathering and transportationfederal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program14table of contentssome of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petitionin 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date may still be impacted by the public regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20 equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco currently plans to file an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc during second quarter 2015 however the timing of that filing is subject to transcos timely completion of the ferc prefiling process and therefore could change  our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basisin light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gaswe use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are 15table of contentsexecuted on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an enduser exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of doddfrank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictablefederal regulation of petroleumour sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferentialeffective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline indexpipeline safety regulationcertain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in non rural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle began during 2013in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulationsin december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure 16table of contentssafety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act although it is anticipated that the dot will propose new regulations in early 2015 in january 2015 it was announced as part of a broad plan to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector that phmsa will propose pipeline safety standards in 2015 that will result in reduced methane emissionson december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dotthe cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulationsenvironmental and safety regulationsgeneral  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to usus laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environmentsolid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contaminationwe generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter todaysuperfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of 17table of contentsor arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been releasedoil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulationsendangered species act  the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected statesclean water act  the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulationsclean air act  our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulationssome of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and gas production transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of january 1 2015 while these rules remain in effect the epa announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years the epa has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected in december 2014 the epa issued finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements further in 2012 seven states sued the epa to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources is appropriate and if so to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources in april 2014 the epa released a set of five white papers analyzing methane emissions from the industry and based on responses received in january 2015 announced plans to propose a rule governing methane emissions from the oil and gas industry in 2015 if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for 18table of contentsnoncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities safe drinking water act  the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the states environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilitieshydraulic fracturing  many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1agreenhouse gas  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and

impact on our business our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the first of the month henry hub index price were 430 per mmbtu in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 287 per mmbtu in february 2015 while oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 5929 per barrel in december 2014 and have continued to decline to 4733 per barrel in january 2015 substantial or extended decline in prices in the future would have a negative impact on our oil and gas reserves and financial results see recent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the followingthe levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global

between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices andoverall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currenciesthese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may cause us to scale back our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligationsdrilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activityour growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling

particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors includingthe results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic datathe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospectsthe approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiledeconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the

projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil21table of contentsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understatedreserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same dataresults of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reservesyou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in generalrecent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operationsthe value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment because our reserves are predominately natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil priceswe evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the futureour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverablein general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically22table of contentsour reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2014 will increase at a rate of 9 during 2015 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 23 and 17 during 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typicalexploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserveswe have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at allwe rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenuesstrategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rateour future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2015 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2015 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectivesnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operationsnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our businessour ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processingthe sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our businessfor example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available 23table of contentsin such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flowswe are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing businessour operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20142016 national enforcement initiative ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilitiesacquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilitiessuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arisethere may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing propertiesthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operationsthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties includethe challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our businessthe inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesspotential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties andthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectationsthe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process 24table of contentswhich will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could sufferwe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial lossesour business involves a variety of operating risks includingwell site blowouts cratering and explosionsequipment failurespipe or cement failures and casing collapses

disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluidsrelease of toxic gasbuildup of naturally occurring radioactive materialspollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties andnatural disastersany of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to usour operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2014 we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenancewe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposedwe maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowswe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operateother companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2014 nonoperated wells represented approximately 92 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 32 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs25table of contentsterrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businessthe threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive positioncompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxationwe may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oilfrom time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectivelythe collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including whena counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligationsproduction is less than expected orthere is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our productionthe cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictablewe will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivativesthe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operateour operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could 26table of contentshave a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmedfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delaysmost of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in may 2013 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorgon august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves in december 2014 the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in january 2015 the epa announced plans to propose a rule in summer 2015 governing methane emissions from oil and natural gas completion operationscompliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our businessin addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 and new york announced the intention to create a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in december 2014 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania 27table of contentsdepartment of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids on december 19 2013 the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules the remaining challenges to act 13 were remanded to the state commonwealth court which dismissed those challenges in july 2014 this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the statewe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2015 the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposala number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in early 2015 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions for example in november 2014 the obama administration announced an agreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions to 26 to 28 of 2005 levels by 2025 further the united states joined over 190 countries in lima peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris france in 2015 in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions for example in june 2013 the obama administration announced its climate action plan which among other things directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions including emissions from the oil and gas sector pursuant to this plan the epa announced in january 2015 a plan to regulate methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants28table of contentsfederal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliablecertain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowssubstantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our businessprovisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change

contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directorsthe personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charterthe delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to

to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this materialoverviewon an equivalent basis our production in 2014 increased by 29 from 2013 we produced 5318 bcfe or 15 bcfe per day in 2014 compared to 4136 bcfe or 11 bcfe per day in 2013 natural gas production increased by 1138 bcf or 29 to 5080 bcf in 2014 compared to 3942 bcf in 2013 this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain noncore asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 07 mbbls or 23 from 32 mmbbls in 2013 to 40 mmbbls in 2014 this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas partially offset by lower production associated with certain noncore asset dispositions in oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2013our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2014 was 328 per mcf 8 lower than the 356 per mcf price realized in 2013 our average realized crude oil price for 2014 was 8850 per bbl 12 lower than the 10113 per bbl price realized in 2013 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1ain december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings from time to time due to commodity price volatility refer to impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationwe drilled 200 gross wells 1765 net with a success rate of 995 in 2014 compared to 181 gross wells 1535 net with a success rate of 983 in 2013 our 2014 total capital and exploration spending was approximately 16 billion excluding the eagle ford shale acquisitions discussed below compared to 12 billion in 2013 the increase in capital spending was the result of our drilling programs in the marcellus shale and eagle ford shale we allocate our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources our 2015 drilling program includes approximately 9000 million in capital and exploration expenditures and approximately 698 million in expected contributions to our equity method investments these expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly36table of contentsacquisitions and divestituresin december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million and paid total cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 296 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facilityin october 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million and paid total net cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 1852 million which reflects the purchase price and adjustments of approximately 174 million for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately 80 million for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes completed in september 2014in october 2014 we completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 443 million total cash consideration received by the company as of the closing date was approximately 428 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustmentsfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidityour primary sources of cash in 2014 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production the issuance of fixed rate notes and proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties during the year these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flowoperating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences and demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenuesour working capital is also substantially influenced by the variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this

no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligationspotential impact of our critical accounting policiesreaders of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed belowsuccessful efforts method of accountingwe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalizedoil and gas reservesthe process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as crude oil and natural gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves40table of contentsour reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa ratein addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the futurecarrying value of oil and gas propertieswe evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 218 million or decrease by approximately 148 million respectively per yearas these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development programasset retirement obligationsthe majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense41table of contentsaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesunder applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket through march 31 2014 we elected to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives on a prospective basis accordingly the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were effective was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operationsour derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksemployee benefit plansour costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plansstockbased compensationwe account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated

oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulationsrestrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditionscommodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil pricesthe majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditionsresults of operations2014 and 2013 comparedwe reported net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share compared to net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset

2013 to 2014 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as followsdirect operations increased 47 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain noncore assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013transportation and gathering

partially offset by a 19 million decrease in ad valorem taxesexploration increased 106 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of 75 million and higher geophysical and geological and other expensesdepreciation depletion and amortization decreased 183 million due to a 362 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of 146 million consisting of a 1676 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by a decrease of 1530 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 113 per mcfe for 2014 compared to 142 per mcfe for 2013 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013 impairment of oil and gas properties was 7710 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 46table of contents2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment there was no impairment in 2013general and administrative decreased 220 million due to lower stockbased compensation expense of 304 million associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased

our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 higher commitment fees of 23 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of 11 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 31 million due to the repayment of 750 million of our 733

and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictablederivative instruments and risk management activitiesour risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and only provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price 50table of contentsdeclines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activitiesperiodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar and swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a

mcf natural gas swaps covered 1022 bcf or 20 of natural gas production at an average price of 406 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 612 mbbl or 17 of crude oil production at an average price of 9700 per bblwe are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see forwardlooking information for further detailsfair market value of other financial instrumentsthe estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at

activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programsthe company operates in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration the companys oil and gas properties are managed as a whole rather than through discrete operating segments or business units operational information is tracked by geographic area however financial performance is assessed as a single enterprise and not on a geographic basis allocation of resources is made on a project basis across the companys entire portfolio without regard to geographic areasthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and

that are readily convertible to cash to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were primarily concentrated in one financial institution at december 31 2014 and in two financial institutions at december 31 2013 the company periodically assesses the financial condition of its financial institutions and considers any possible credit risk to be minimalallowance for doubtful accountsthe company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the company determines to be uncollectible based on the specific identification methodinventoriesinventories are comprised of natural gas in storage tubular goods and well equipment and pipeline imbalances natural gas in storage and tubular goods and well equipment balances are carried at the lower of average cost or marketnatural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline the volumes of natural gas due to or from the company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual selling or purchase prices as the case may be and are adjusted monthly to market pricesequity method investmentsthe company accounts for its investments in entities over which the company has significant influence but not control using the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting the company increases its investment for contributions made and records its proportionate share of net earnings declared dividends and partnership distributions based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee the company also evaluates its equity method investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is an otherthantemporary decline in the value of the investment60table of contentsproperties and equipment the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs are expensed development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalizedexploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves the determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical and engineering data if a well is determined to be successful the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well if a well is determined to be unsuccessful the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the period the determination is made if an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether reserves have been found only as long as i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future if drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expensedevelopment costs of proved oil and gas properties including estimated dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the unitsofproduction method using proved developed and proved reserves respectively properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years buildings are depreciated on a straightline basis over 25 to 40 years certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over 3 to 10 yearscosts of retired sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base partial field are charged to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization if the unitsofproduction rate is not significantly affected a gain or loss if any is recognized only when a group of proved properties entire field that make up the amortization base has been retired abandoned or soldthe company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights during 2014 2013 and 2012 amortization associated with the companys unproved properties was 174 million 536 million and 181 million respectively and is included in depreciation depletion and amortization in the consolidated statement of operationsasset retirement obligationsthe company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset the asset retirement costs are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells however liabilities are also recorded for meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors at december 31 2014 there were no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligationsadditional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred accretion expense is included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operations61table of contentsderivative and hedging activities the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps to manage its exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and oil production all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value at the end of each quarterly period these derivatives are markedtomarket if the derivative does not qualify or is not designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized currently in income if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effectivethe hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production occurs if the company determines that it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in income immediatelygains and losses on cash flow hedges are included in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues gains and losses on derivatives which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivatives not designated or does not qualify for hedge accounting are included in operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activitiesthrough march 31 2014 the company elected to designate its commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes effective april 1 2014 the company elected to discontinue hedge accounting for its commodity derivatives on a prospective basisfair value of assets and liabilities the company follows the authoritative accounting guidance for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities in financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as followslevel 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2 quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilitylevel 3 significant unobservable inputs for use when little or no market data exists requiring a significant degree of judgmentthe hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in the valuation should be chosenrevenue recognition natural gas and oil sales result from interests in oil and gas properties owned by the company sales of natural gas and oil are recognized when the product is delivered and title transfers to the purchaser payment is generally received one to three months after the sale has occurredproducer gas imbalances the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances a natural gas imbalance liability is recorded if the 62table of contentscompanys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties at the actual price realized upon the gas salebrokered natural gas revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company buys and sells natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions typically with separate counterparties whereby the company andor the counterparty takes title to the natural gas purchased or soldincome taxes the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realizedthe company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertaintiesthe company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and accrued penalties related to such positions in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operationsstockbased compensationthe company accounts for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value the company uses either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operationsthe tax benefit for stockbased compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the companys income taxes payableenvironmental mattersenvironmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an

closing and approximately 80 million for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs in addition the company also assumed a liability of approximately 12 million related to asset retirement obligations of the wells acquired the company accounted for these transactions as an asset purchase whereby the identifiable assets acquired were recorded at cost with the respective assigned carrying amount based on the relative fair value of the unproved and proved properties at the acquisition date the fair value measurement of assets acquired was based on inputs that are not observable in the market and therefore represent level 3 inputs the fair value of oil and gas properties were measured using discounted future cash flows the discount factor used was based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oil significant inputs to the valuation of oil and gas properties include i reserves including risk adjustments for probable and possible reserves ii production rates based on the companys experience with similar properties in which it

income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts andor are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of the fair values presented above also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk the company measured the nonperformance risk of its counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions with which it has derivative transactions while nonperformance risk of the company is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by the companys bankthe most significant unobservable inputs relative to the companys level 3 derivative contracts are basis differentials and volatility factors an increase decrease in these unobservable inputs would result in an increase decrease in fair value respectively the company does not have access to the

the plan adopted by the companys board of directors is intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for fulltime nonofficer employees by providing for cash payments in the event the companys common stock reaches a specified trading price the compensation committee can increase any of the payments as applied to any employee if desired any deferred portion will only be paid if the participant is employed by the company or has terminated employment by reason of retirement death or disability as provided in the plan payments are subject to certain other restrictions contained in the plan87table of contentsthe plan currently provides for a payout if the closing price per share of the companys common stock for any 20 trading days out of any 60 days consecutive trading days equals or exceeds an interim price goal per share within two years of the effective date of the plan interim trigger date or a final price goal per share within four years of the effective date of the plan final trigger date under the plan and upon approval by the compensation committee each eligible employee may receive a distribution of 20 of base salary if the interim trigger is met or 50 of base salary if the final trigger is met or an incremental 30 of base salary if the interim trigger was previously achieved in accordance with the plan in the event either the interim or final trigger date occurs within the first 30 months from the effective date 25 of the total distribution will be paid immediately and the remaining 75 will be deferred and paid at a future date as described in the plan for final trigger dates occurring during the last 18 months but before the end of the plan total distribution will be paid immediately the plan is accounted for as a liability award under the authoritative accounting guidance for stockbased compensation and is valued as of the end of each reporting period on a marktomarket basis using a monte carlo simulation model in addition to the expected value of plan payouts the simulation technique also generates an expected trigger date for the two types of payments made under this plan which is used to determine the requisite service period the company recognized compensation expense of 30 million 115 million and 14 million for years ended december 31 2014 2013

corporationsupplemental oil and gas information unauditedoil and gas reservesusers of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosuresestimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 were based on studies performed by the companys petroleum engineering staff the estimates were computed using the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of

limitations described in their audit letter they believe the results of those estimates and projections were reasonable in the aggregateno major discovery or other favorable or unfavorable event after
