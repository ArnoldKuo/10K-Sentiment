the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this materialoverviewon an equivalent basis our production in 2014 increased by 29 from 2013 we produced 5318 bcfe or 15 bcfe per day in 2014 compared to 4136 bcfe or 11 bcfe per day in 2013 natural gas production increased by 1138 bcf or 29 to 5080 bcf in 2014 compared to 3942 bcf in 2013 this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania partially offset by lower production primarily in oklahoma and west texas as a result of certain noncore asset dispositions in the fourth quarter of 2013 and normal production declines in texas and west virginia crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 07 mbbls or 23 from 32 mmbbls in 2013 to 40 mmbbls in 2014 this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas partially offset by lower production associated with certain noncore asset dispositions in oklahoma in the fourth quarter of 2013our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2014 was 328 per mcf 8 lower than the 356 per mcf price realized in 2013 our average realized crude oil price for 2014 was 8850 per bbl 12 lower than the 10113 per bbl price realized in 2013 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1ain december 2014 we recorded a 7710 million impairment of oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue any further activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis subsequent to april 1 2014 our derivative instruments were accounted for on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized currently in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings from time to time due to commodity price volatility refer to impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationwe drilled 200 gross wells 1765 net with a success rate of 995 in 2014 compared to 181 gross wells 1535 net with a success rate of 983 in 2013 our 2014 total capital and exploration spending was approximately 16 billion excluding the eagle ford shale acquisitions discussed below compared to 12 billion in 2013 the increase in capital spending was the result of our drilling programs in the marcellus shale and eagle ford shale we allocate our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources our 2015 drilling program includes approximately 9000 million in capital and exploration expenditures and approximately 698 million in expected contributions to our equity method investments these expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our revolving credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly36table of contentsacquisitions and divestituresin december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million and paid total cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 296 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facilityin october 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million and paid total net cash consideration as of the closing date of approximately 1852 million which reflects the purchase price and adjustments of approximately 174 million for consents that the seller was unable to obtain for certain leaseholds prior to closing and approximately 80 million for the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costs the acquisition was funded with proceeds from the private placement of senior unsecured fixed rate notes completed in september 2014in october 2014 we completed the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 443 million total cash consideration received by the company as of the closing date was approximately 428 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustmentsfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidityour primary sources of cash in 2014 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production the issuance of fixed rate notes and proceeds from the sale of certain oil and gas properties during the year these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flowoperating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences and demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenuesour working capital is also substantially influenced by the variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements

exploration expenditures compared to 16 billion excluding property acquisitions of 2147 million as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in 2014 due to the weak commodity price environment our overall capital and exploration spending in 2015 is expected to be lower than our expenditures in 2014 we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and

fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at december 31 2014 interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2014 outstanding balance of 1400 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date and that our fixed rate notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates a constant interest rate of 24 was assumed for the interest payments on our revolving credit facility which was the december 31 2014 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions2in january 2015 we entered into a natural gas transportation agreement associated with our production in pennsylvania which increased our future aggregate obligations under our transportation commitments by approximately 1059 million over the next 10 years which is not included in the table above for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements3for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsamounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2014 was 1267 million see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detailswe have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligationspotential impact of our critical accounting policiesreaders of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed belowsuccessful efforts method of accountingwe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalizedoil and gas reservesthe process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as crude oil and natural gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves40table of contentsour reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa ratein addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the futurecarrying value of oil and gas propertieswe evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 218 million or decrease by approximately 148 million respectively per yearas these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development programasset retirement obligationsthe majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense41table of contentsaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesunder applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket through march 31 2014 we elected to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes effective april 1 2014 we elected to discontinue hedge accounting for our commodity derivatives on a prospective basis accordingly the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were effective was recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operationsour derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksemployee benefit plansour costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plansstockbased compensationwe account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensationrecent accounting pronouncements in april 2014 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update

financial position or results of operationsother issues and contingencies regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulationsrestrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2014 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditionscommodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil pricesthe majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditionsresults of operations2014 and 2013 comparedwe reported net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share compared to net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase in operating revenues and an increase in income tax benefit43table of contentsrevenue price and volume variancesour revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in commodity

2013 to 2014 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as followsdirect operations increased 47 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain noncore assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013transportation and gathering increased 1198 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in late 2013 and during 2014brokered natural gas increased 01 million from 2013 to 2014 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysistaxes other than income increased 40 million due to 25 million higher drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities 25 million higher production taxes and 09 million higher franchise and other taxes production taxes increased due to higher oil production in south texas offset by taxes associated with certain noncore assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013 these increases are partially offset by a 19 million decrease in ad valorem taxesexploration increased 106 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of 75 million and higher geophysical and geological and other expensesdepreciation depletion and amortization decreased 183 million due to a 362 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of 146 million consisting of a 1676 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by a decrease of 1530 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 113 per mcfe for 2014 compared to 142 per mcfe for 2013 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013 impairment of oil and gas properties was 7710 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 46table of contents2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment there was no impairment in 2013general and administrative decreased 220 million due to lower stockbased compensation expense of 304 million associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards and our supplemental employee incentive plan due to changes in our stock price during 2014 compared to 2013 and lower employeerelated expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional feesearnings loss on equity method investments the increase in equity method investments is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013 gain loss on sale of assets during 2014 we recognized an aggregate gain of 171 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2013 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a net gain of 195 million interest expense interest expense increased 77 million as a result of an increase in interest expense of 97 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured fixed rate notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 higher commitment fees of 23 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of 11 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 31 million due to the repayment of 750 million of our 733 weightedaverage fixed rate notes in july 2013 and 11 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 4100 million compared to approximately 4544 million during 2014 and 2013 respectively income tax expense income tax expense decreased 2778 million due to a decrease in pretax income and a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were 2224 and 424 respectively the effective tax rate was lower as a result of a change in estimated net deferred state tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet which were based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate2013 and 2012 comparedwe reported net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share compared to net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset

reasons for this fluctuation are as followsdirect operations increased 226 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production in addition we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas related to our eagle ford operations higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance coststransportation and gathering increased 862 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various

preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysis49table of contentstaxes other than income decreased 58 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities full year 2012 included 83 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells in addition franchise sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texasexploration decreased 193 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of 136 million primarily due to our brown densesmackover exploratory well in union county arkansas that was recorded in 2012 there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013 in addition geophysical and geological expenses decreased 70 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic datadepreciation depletion and amortization increased 1996 million of which 2344 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease of 708 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 142 per mcfe for 2013 compared to 158 per mcfe for 2012 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 355 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the yeargeneral and administrative decreased 166 million due to lower pension expense of 195 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012 a decrease in legal expenses of 90 million and 22 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012 these decreases are partially offset by 183 million of higher stockbased compensation expense associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013gain loss on sale of assets
