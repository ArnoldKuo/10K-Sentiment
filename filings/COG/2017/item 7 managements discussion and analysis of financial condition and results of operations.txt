the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this materialoverviewfinancial and operating overview financial and operating results for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to the year ended december 31 2015 are as follows equivalent production increased 246 bcfe or 4 from 6025 bcfe or 16508 mmcfe per day in 2015 to 6271 bcfe or 17134 mmcfe per day in 2016 natural gas production increased 344 bcf or 6 from 5660 bcf in 2015 to 6004 bcf in 2016 as a result of drilling and completion activities in pennsylvania partially offset by the divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in early 2016crude oilcondensatengl production decreased 16 mmbbls or 27 from 61 mmbbls in 2015 to 45 mmbbls in 2016 as a result of a decrease in drilling activities in south texas average realized natural gas price for 2016 was 170 per mcf 21 lower than the 215 per mcf price realized in 2015 average realized crude oil price for 2016 was 3730 per bbl 18 lower than the 4572 per bbl price realized in 2015 drilled 40 gross wells 380 net with a success rate of 1000 in 2016 compared to 138 gross wells 1305 net with a success rate of 1000 in 2015 completed 76 gross wells 760 net in 2016 compared to 107 gross wells 989 net in 2015 total capital expenditures were 3725 million in 2016 compared to 7735 million in 2015 average rig count during 2016 was approximately 11 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 03 rigs in the eagle ford shale compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 35 rigs and approximately 19 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2015in february 2016 we completed a public offering of our common stock and received net proceeds of 9956 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions in february 2016 we received proceeds of 501 million primarily related to the divestiture of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texasin may 2016 we repurchased 640 million principal amount of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes for approximately 683 millionin december 2016 we recognized an impairment loss of 4356 million associated with our oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia market conditions and commodity pricesour financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials weather conditions and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success for information about the impact of realized commodity prices on our natural gas and crude 38table of contentsoil and condensate revenues refer to results of operations below see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationcommodity prices have remained volatile and have improved during the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 but have yet to recover to levels experienced in 2014 in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge we believe we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in the current commodity pricing environment and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices bycontinuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by fully funding our capital expenditures with operating cash flows continuing to optimize our drilling completion and operational efficiencies resulting in lower operating costs per unit of productioncontinuing to manage our balance sheet which included the issuance of common stock in february 2016 our common stock issuance allowed us to pay down the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes leaving us with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility and existing cash balances to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenants continuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil productionfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidityour primary sources of cash in 2016 were from funds generated from the sale of common stock the sale of natural gas and oil production and proceeds from the sale of assets these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments repayment of indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and to repurchase certain of our senior notes interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flowin february 2016 we sold an aggregate of 506 million shares of common stock at a price of 19675 per share and received 9956 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions these net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes including repaying indebtedness under our revolving credit facility repurchasing certain of our senior notesthe borrowing base under the terms of our revolving credit facility is redetermined annually in april in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in connection with certain acquisitions or divestitures of oil and gas properties effective april 19 2016 our borrowing base was reduced from 34 billion to 32 billion the maximum credit amount under the revolving credit facility remained unchanged at 18 billion however the available commitments were reduced to 16 billion at the time of redetermination in may 2016 we repurchased 640 million principal amount of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes for approximately 683 million a 47 million extinguishment loss was recognized in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the premium paid and the writeoff of a portion of the related deferred financing costs due to early repayment as a result of the repurchase of these senior notes the available commitments under the revolving credit facility increased to 17 billion and remained at that level as of december 31 201639table of contentsa decline in commodity prices could result in the future reduction of our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility unless commodity prices decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt we believe that with the existing cash on hand internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plansas of december 31 2016 we had no borrowings outstanding and unused commitments of 17 billion under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2015 we had 4130 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2016 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debtcash flowsour cash flows from operating activities investing activities and financing activities are as follows year ended december 31in thousands201620152014cash flows provided by

equivalents498028204402446operating activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile primarily as a result of supply and demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively sales of our securities and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2016 and 2015 we had a working capital surplus of 4581 million and a deficit of 908 million respectively we believe we have adequate liquidity and availability under our revolving credit facility available to meet our working capital requirements over the next twelve monthsnet cash provided by operating activities in 2016 decreased by 3484 million when compared to 2015 this decrease was primarily due to unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities and lower operating revenues partially offset by lower operating expenses excluding noncash expenses the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 21 and 18 respectively for 2016 compared to 2015 equivalent production increased by 4 for 2016 over 2015 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale partially offset by lower oil production in the eagle ford shale net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by 4957 million when compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34 and 48 respectively for 2015 compared to 2014 equivalent production volumes increased by 13 for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale 40table of contentssee results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 6401 million from 2015 to 2016 due to a decrease of 5804 million in capital expenditures 163 million lower acquisition costs and 428 million higher proceeds from the sale of assetscash flows used in investing activities decreased by 6715 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of 5240 million in capital expenditures 1984 million lower acquisition costs and a 90 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments these decreases were partially offset by a 318 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and 281 million of changes in restricted cash balances financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 2267 million from 2015 to 2016 due to 9953 million of net proceeds related to the issuance of common stock and lower capitalized debt issuance costs of 46 million related to the amendment of our revolving credit facility and senior notes in december 2015 these increases were partially offset by 7700 million of higher net repayments of debt due to the repayment of the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility and certain of our senior notes with the proceeds from the issuance of common stock and 31 million of higher dividend paymentscash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 1938 million from 2014 to 2015 due to 3320 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 22 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015 these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases of 1389 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of 14 million in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation capitalizationinformation about our capitalization is as follows december 31dollars in

detailswe have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligationspotential impact of our critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates successful efforts method of accountingwe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized oil and gas reservesthe process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisionsour reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 004 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa ratein addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future carrying value of oil and gas propertieswe evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural 43table of contentsgas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 89 million or decrease by approximately 75 million respectively per yearas these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development programasset retirement obligationsthe majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expenseaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesunder applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksour financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials 44table of contentsincome taxeswe make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertaintieswe believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realizedour effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings contingency reservesa provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued stockbased compensationwe account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full

regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations45table of contentsrestrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125 to 10 which increases back to a ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 475 to 10 through and including december 31 2016 under the terms of the respective agreements the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 425 to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 35 to 10 beginning on march 31 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard amp poors ratings services sampp or moodys investor service inc moodys at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2016 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditions commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 97 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil pricesthe majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar swap and basis swap arrangements to reduce the impact of sustained lower pricing on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditionsresults of operations2016 and 2015 comparedwe reported a net loss for 2016 of 4171 million or 091 per share compared to net loss for 2015 of 1139 million or 028 per share the increase in net loss was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses partially offset by a higher income tax benefit 46table of contentsrevenue price and volume

followsdirect operations decreased 401 million largely due to improved operational efficiencies cost reductions from service providers and suppliers in 2016 compared to 2015 and divestiture of certain oil and gas properties in east texas in february 2016transportation and gathering increased 90 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production and the commencement of

brokered natural gas for further analysistaxes other than income decreased 136 million due to 72 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil prices and production in south texas and the receipt of a production tax refund of 19 million in february 2016 additionally drilling impact fees decreased 15 million as a result of drilling fewer wells in pennsylvania during 2016 compared to 2015 and ad valorem taxes decreased 38 million as a result of lower property values primarily in south texas the remaining changes were not individually significantexploration increased 02 million as a result of a 67 million increase in exploratory dry hole expense partially offset by lower charges related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas and 27 million lower geophysical and geological costs and other exploration expenses during 2016 we recorded rig termination charges of 17 million compared to 51 million during 2015 depreciation depletion and amortization decreased 321 million of which 412 million was due to a lower ddampa rate of 087 per mcfe for 2016 compared to 093 per mcfe for 2015 partially offset by a 230 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 associated with higher ddampa rate fields in addition amortization of unproved properties decreased 164 million in 2016 as a result of lower lease acquisition costs and lower amortization rates impairment of oil and gas properties and other assets was 4356 million in 2016 due to the impairment of oil and gas properties and related pipeline assets in west virginia and virginia in 2015 we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of 1149 million related to certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 general and administrative increased 178 million due to higher stockbased compensation expense of 123 million primarily the result of an increase in the companys stock price during 2016 compared to 2015 and 27

weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the writeoff of a portion of the associated deferred financing costs due to early repaymentinterest expense interest expense decreased 86 million due to a 55 million decrease resulting from the repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility in march 2016 which remained undrawn through december 31 2016 interest expense also decreased 34 million resulting from the repurchase of a portion of our 651 weightedaverage senior notes in may 2016 and the repayment of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes at maturity these decreases were offset by a 06 million increase in commitment fees as a result of an increase in the unused portion of the commitments under our revolving credit facility income tax benefit income tax benefit increased 1691 million due to a higher pretax loss partially offset by a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2016 and 2015 were 368 and 392 respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the impact of nonrecurring discrete items recorded during 2016 compared to 2015 49table of contentswe expect our 2017 effective income tax rate to be approximately 370 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state tax rates that occur during the year as well as

change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected
