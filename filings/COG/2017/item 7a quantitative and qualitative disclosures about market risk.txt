market risk our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictablederivative instruments and risk management activitiesour risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activitiesperiodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar swap and basis swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk 53table of contentsmanagement purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futuresas of december 31 2016 we had the

prices are stated per mcf and crude oil prices are stated per barrel the amounts set forth in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2016 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is considered in the fair value of our derivative instruments that are recorded in our consolidated financial statements and is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksa significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2017 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable during 2016 natural gas swaps covered 520 bcf or 9 of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 251 per mcf crude oil collars with floor prices of 3800 per bbl and ceiling prices ranging from 4710 to 4750 per bbl covered 14 mmbbl or 34 of crude oil production at a weightedaverage price of 4561 per bbl we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk of our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see forwardlooking information for further detailsfair value of other financial instrumentsthe estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments cash and cash equivalents are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchywe use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured 54table of contentsand secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows  december 31 2016 december 31 2015in thousandscarrying amount estimated fairvalue  carrying amount estimated fair
