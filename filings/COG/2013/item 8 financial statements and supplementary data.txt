right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time   existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined the price shall be the average price during the twelvemonth period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined

term used in the oil and gas industry to refer to a play in which the targeted reservoirs generally fall into one of three categories 1 tight sands 2 coal beds or 3 shales the reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps seals and discrete hydrocarbonwater boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs these reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to achieve economic flow rates   undeveloped reserves undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty   unproved properties properties with no proved reserves   working interest an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations  5                 table of contents       part i    items 1 and 2 business and properties   cabot oil amp gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration exclusively in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania   strategy   our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy include   disciplined capital spending focused on highreturn organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost highreturn repeatable drilling opportunities   low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure   conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with asset sales joint ventures and borrowings under our credit facility   expand our unconventional resource initiatives through value generating opportunities we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including potential strategic sales of assets that no longer fit in our current portfolio and the use of various joint venture arrangements to achieve our objectives we intend to reinvest the proceeds from these activities in our core unconventional assets   2013 outlook   in 2013 we plan to spend between approximately 9500 million and 10 billion on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 170 to 180 gross wells or 130 to 145 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford and pearsall shale in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we expect to allocate approximately 65 of our 2013 capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 30 to our  6      table of contents liquidsfocused plays in south texas and oklahoma and the remaining 5 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures in 2013 we also expect to contribute approximately 120 million to constitution pipeline company llc constitution to fund costs associated with the development and construction of a pipeline in northeast pennsylvania which is incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in constitution   description of properties   our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in three unconventional playsthe marcellus shale in pennsylvania the eagle ford in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma we also have significant noncore operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united states   marcellus shale   the marcellus shale is one of our major operating areas and represents our largest growth and capital investment area over the last four years our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent bradford and wyoming counties pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2012 net production in the marcellus shale was 2093 bcfe representing approximately 78 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 2242 net wells producing in the marcellus shale   during 2012 we invested 6166 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 697 net horizontal wells and completed and turned in line 802 net wells as of december 31 2012 we had 320 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2012 with five drilling rigs operating in the play   eagle ford shale   our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio la salle and zavala counties texas where we hold over 60000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2012 our net liquids and natural gas production from the eagle ford was 1581 mbbl and 16 bcf respectively

million in the eagle ford and drilled or participated in drilling 232 net wells we exited 2012 with one drilling rig operating in the play   marmaton   our properties in the marmaton oil play are principally located in beaver county oklahoma and ochiltree county texas as of december 31 2012 we had over 70000 net acres in the play in 2012 our net liquids and natural gas production from the marmaton was 364 mbbl and 06 bcf respectively or 28 bcfe representing approximately 1 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2012 we had a total of 211 net wells producing in the marmaton and 33 net wells completing or waiting on completion   during 2012 we invested 803 million in the marmaton and drilled or participated in drilling 179 net wells we exited 2012 with two drilling rigs operating in the play   other oil and gas properties   in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the pearsall  7      table of contents shale in south texas the utica shale in pennsylvania the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas the devonian shale big lime weir and berea shale in west virginia the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas and the chase morrow and chester formations in oklahoma   in 2013 we plan to drill a total of 98 net wells in the pearsall shale all of which are subject to a joint development agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of osaka gas co ltd osaka that was entered into contemporaneously with the sale of a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in june 2012 under the joint development agreement osaka agreed to fund 85 of our share of future drilling and completion costs associated with these leaseholds until it has paid approximately 1260 million the drilling and completion carry will terminate in june 2014   other properties   ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3134 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and five local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2012 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system   we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia   divestitures   in december 2012 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas to a private company for 299 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized an 182 million loss on sale of assets   in june 2012 we sold a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas to a whollyowned subsidiary of osaka for 1250 million in cash proceeds and recognized a 670 million gain on sale of assets   in 2012

total proceeds of 322 million and recognized an aggregate gain of 163 million   marketing   the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern and midwestern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area and the midwestern united states we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets   risk management   from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas and crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap was put in place   during 2012 natural gas and crude oil swaps covered 960 bcf or 38 and 1709 mbbl or 76 of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of 522 per mcf and 10012 per bbl respectively natural gas basis swaps covered 17 bcf or 7 of our natural gas production at an average price of 025 per mcf natural

title to properties   we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties often little investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties   competition   competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources   major customers   in 2012 three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales in 2011 we did not have any one customer account for greater than 10 of our total sales in 2010 one customer accounted for approximately 11 of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available   seasonality   demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months   regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil  14      table of contents and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry   natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program   some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we indirectly own an intrastate natural gas pipeline that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates in addition we have executed a precedent agreement with constitution pipeline company llc a subsidiary of williams partners lp for transportation capacity and a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania in april 2012 the project sponsors requested to participate in fercs prefiling procedures and once complete will need to request and receive a certificate of public convenience and necessity from ferc prior to commencing construction there is no guarantee that ferc will certify the project or if they do that the project scope or timeline for construction will remain unchanged by the regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga   our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate  15      table of contents pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis   in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas   federal regulation of petroleum   our sales of oil and natural gas liquids are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential   effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting oil and natural gas liquids by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for  16      table of contents the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential   another ferc matter that may impact our transportation costs relates to a policy that allows a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership or similar noncorporate entity to include in its rates a tax allowance with respect to income for which there is an actual or potential income tax liability to be determined on a case by case basis generally speaking where the holder of a partnership unit interest is required to file a tax return that includes partnership income or loss such unitholder is presumed to have an actual or potential income tax liability sufficient to support a tax allowance on that partnership income we currently do not transport any of our crude oil or natural gas liquids on a pipeline structured as a master limited partnership   we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index or of the application of the fercs policy on income tax allowances   pipeline safety regulation   certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle will begin in 2013   in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulations   in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act  17      table of contents  on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot   the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations   environmental and safety regulations   general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us   the transition zone and shallowwater areas of the us gulf coast are ecologically sensitive environmental issues have led to higher drilling costs and a more difficult and lengthy well permitting process us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment requiring consistency with applicable coastal zone management plans or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment   solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination  18      table of contents  we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today   superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released   oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations   clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations   clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations  19      table of contents  hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1a   greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the us congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act please read risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce in item 1a   osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations also pursuant to osha the occupational safety and health administration has established a variety of standards related to workplace exposure to hazardous substances and employee health and safety   employees   as of december 31 2012 we had

and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business   our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and to a lesser extent oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results and could result in an impairment charge see future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results   prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following   the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus properties on the global natural gas supply   the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east africa and south america  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  the price level of foreign imports  actions of governmental authorities  the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil  inventory storage levels  the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation  the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels   21      table of contents   technological advances affecting energy consumption  speculation by investors in oil and gas  variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and   overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies    these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and oil if natural gas prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations   drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity   our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including   unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations   equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  decreases in natural gas and oil prices  surface access restrictions  loss of title or other title related issues  compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation and   costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials    our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may ultimately not be able to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may not be able to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including   the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic data   the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects   the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled   economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews  our financial resources and results and   22      table of contents   the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits    these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil   our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated   reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data   results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves   you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general   future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations   the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and crude oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties   we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices  23      table of contents adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future   our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable   in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically   our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2012 will increase at an estimated rate of 9 during 2013 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 22 and 17 during 2014 2015 and 2016 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical   exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves   we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all   we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues   strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate   our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2013 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of  24      table of contents our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2013 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives   negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations   negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing the oil spill in the gulf of mexico and the explosion of natural gas transmission lines in california and elsewhere may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these action may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business   increased drilling in the shale formations may cause pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints that may limit our ability to sell natural gas andor receive market prices for our natural gas   the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates if drilling in the marcellus shale continues to be successful the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20112013 national enforcement initiative assuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to  25      table of contents administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities   acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities   successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise   there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties   the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations   the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include   the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business   the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations    the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer   we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses   our business involves a variety of operating risks including   well site blowouts cratering and explosions  equipment failures   26      table of contents   pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids  uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids  pipeline ruptures  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids   release of toxic gas  buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials  pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties and   natural disasters    any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us   our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2012 we owned or operated approximately 3134 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance   we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed   we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows   we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate   other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 117 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 37 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2012 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs  27                 table of contents   terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business   the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations future acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business   our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing   the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available of capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business   competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position   competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation   we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil   from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively   the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below  28      table of contents the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when   a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations  production is less than expected or  there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production    we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives   the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate   our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed   federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays   most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released draft permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids moreover on november 23 2011 the epa announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production further on may 4 2012 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been  29      table of contents completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg   on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells are required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring by october 15 2012 if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves we are currently reviewing this new rule and assessing its potential impacts compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business   in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia texas kansas louisiana and montana and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the railroad commission of texas adopted rules in december 2011 requiring disclosure of certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids   we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our eampp operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2014 the regulations will be developed  30      table of contents under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal   a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released of a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in 2014 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms president obama created the interagency working group on unconventional natural gas and oil by executive order on april 13 2012 which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources   climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce   there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at the state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epas endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil also according to the epa the final motor vehicle ghg standards will trigger construction and operating permit requirements for stationary sources thus on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting in addition on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epas ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year were required to report annual ghg emissions to epa for the first time by september 28 2012 we submitted our report in compliance with the deadline   in addition congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation or legislation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new  31      table of contents regulatory or reporting requirements in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas   moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it ongoing international discussions following the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in december 2012 are exploring options to replace the kyoto protocol   moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make estimating any future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change extremely challenging   certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows   substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business   provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment   our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit stockholder action by written consent and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors   the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter   the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will  32      table of contents not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability   for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders   for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law   under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and   for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit    this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders       item 1b unresolved staff comments    none       item 3 legal proceedings    legal matters   the information set forth under the heading legal matters in note 8 of

assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material   overview   on an equivalent basis our production in 2012 increased by 43 from 2011 we produced 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 compared to 1875 bcfe or 5137 mmcfe per day in 2011 natural gas production increased by 744 bcf or 42 to 2532 bcf in 2012 compared to 1788 bcf in 2011 this increase was primarily the result of increased production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale was the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 along with decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 964 mbbls or 67 from 1443 mbbls in 2011 to 2407 mbbls in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of increased production resulting from our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma   our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2012 was 367 per mcf 18 lower than the 446 per mcf price realized in 2011 our average realized crude oil price for 2012 was 10165 per bbl 12 higher than the 9049 per bbl price realized in 2011 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a   we drilled 170 gross wells with a success rate of 98 in 2012 compared to 161 gross wells with a success rate of 99 in 2011 our 2012 total capital and exploration spending was 9785 million compared to 9055 million in 2011 this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford shale in south texas including a portion towards the pearsall shale and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma in both 2012 and 2011 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2013 our 2013 drilling program includes between 9500 million and 10 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility  38      table of contents  financial condition   capital resources and liquidity   our primary sources of cash in 2012 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties and other assets during the year and borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures in addition to repayments of debt and related interest final contributions to fund the liquidation of our pension plan and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements                         year ended december 31      in thousands     2012    2011    2010       cash flows provided by operating activities     652093

1503 million over 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was partially offset by changes in working capital and longterm assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices equivalent production volumes increased by 43 for 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 18 for 2012 compared to 2011 while average realized crude oil prices increased by 12 compared to the same period   net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by 169 million over 2010 this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in 2011 as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 44 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 8 over the same period  39      table of contents  see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods   investing activities   the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures we established our budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year   cash flows used in investing activities increased by 2779 million from 2011 to 2012 and decreased by 1261 million from 2010 to 2011 the increase from 2011 to 2012 was due to a decrease of 2343 million of proceeds from the sale of assets an increase of 367 million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of 69 million associated with our equity investment in constitution the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase of 1601 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of 340 million in capital and exploration expenditures   financing activities   cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 1545 million from 2011 to 2012 this was primarily due to 1620 million of higher net borrowings 700 million increase in borrowings and 920 million decrease in repayment of debt partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 42 million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 40 million cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1849 million from 2010 to 2011 this was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of 1950 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 128 million   at december 31 2012 we had 3250 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 compared to 1880 million of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 49 at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 we had 5740 million available for future borrowings under our credit facility   in may 2012 we amended our credit facility to adjust the margins associated with borrowings under the facility and extended the maturity date from september 2015 to may 2017 the credit facility as amended provides for an available credit line of 900 million and contains a 500 million accordion feature whereby we may increase the available credit line to 14 billion if one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount as of december 31 2012 the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was 17 billion see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details   we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash on hand

includes between approximately 9500 million and 10 billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately 120 million to constitution compared to 9785 million in 2012 we expect our capital spending in 2013 to be consistent with that of 2012 based on our estimate of natural gas and crude oil prices over the next year we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly  41      table of contents  contractual

longterm debt outstanding including current maturities at december 31 2012 interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2012 outstanding balance of 3250 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date a constant interest rate of 22 was assumed which was the december 31 2012 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 2for further information on our obligations under transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 3for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december

impact of our critical accounting policies   readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below   successful efforts method of accounting   we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized  42                table of contents   oil and gas reserves   the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves   our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller amp lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8   our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa rate   in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future   carrying value of oil and gas properties   we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property  43      table of contents lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 23 million or decrease by approximately 18 million respectively per year   as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program   asset retirement obligation   the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities   under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations   our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks  44      table of contents  employee benefit plans   our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans   stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation   recent accounting pronouncements   in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1 offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or 2 subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in january 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update clarify that the scope of asu 201111 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging including bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows  45      table of contents  other issues and contingencies   regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations   restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation   operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate   commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results   the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions   results of operations   2012 and 2011 compared   we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 063 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an  46      table of contents increase in equivalent production and higher

unrealized losses discussed above is primarily due to increased production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increased production was primarily a result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines   crude oil and condensate revenues   the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1020 million is primarily due to increased production associated with our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in

operations increased by 2127 million from 2011 to 2012 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows   direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher employee related and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs  transportation and gathering increased by 700 million primarily due higher throughput due to an increase in production and higher transportation rates coupled with the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012 primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas  brokered natural gas decreased by 153 million from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income increased 213 million primarily due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011  exploration increased 10 million primarily due to an increase in exploration expense as the result of increased activity partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data  depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1083 million with a 1314 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an 85 million decrease due to a lower ddampa rate this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 144 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 2012   49                     table of contents    general and administrative increased by 166 million primarily due to 140 million higher pension expense associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012 and higher legal costs and professional fees of 60 million also contributing to the increase was the accrual of 19 million associated with fines and penalties assessed by the office of natural resources revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters which we are currently disputing related to properties we no longer own and a 22 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by 63 million of lower stockbased compensation expense primarily associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011   gain  loss on sale of assets    during 2012 we recognized an aggregate gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas during the 2011 an aggregate gain of 634 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east texas and the sale of other noncore assets    interest expense net    interest expense and other decreased by 34 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which decreased to approximately 30 during 2012 compared to approximately 41 during 2011 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on weightedaverage debt of 2838 million in 2012 compared to weightedaverage debt of 3177 million in 2011   income tax expense   income tax expense decreased by 67 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income the effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 446 and 480 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes   2011 and 2010 compared   we reported net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share compared to net income of 1034 million or 050 per share for 2010 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher operating costs  50      table of contents  revenue price and volume variances   below is a discussion of revenue price and volume

334 million from 2010 to 2011 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows   direct operations increased 78 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher workover and environmental and regulatory costs associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast pennsylvania in the fourth quarter of 2010  transportation and gathering increased by 543 million primarily due to the commencement of various firm transportation and gathering arrangements in 2011 primarily in northeast pennsylvania  brokered natural gas decreased by 126 million from 2010 to 2011 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysis  taxes other than income decreased 103 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and property values and lower franchise tax expense   exploration decreased 63 million due to lower geological and geophysical costs primarily due to a reduction in the acquisition of seismic data partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in montana  depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 161 million of which 298 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower ddampa rate and a 14 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations the increase in depreciation and depletion was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 151 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities  impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by 409 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south texas fields recognized as a result of commodity price declines and   53      table of contents   limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010 there were no impairments in 2011    general and administrative increased by 255 million primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 251 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares due to changes in our stock price in 2011 compared 2010 higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase these increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the padep consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010    gain  loss on sale of assets   during 2011 we recognized a gain of 342 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east texas and an aggregate gain of 292 million related to the sale of various other noncore assets during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the sale of our pennsylvania gathering infrastructure 407 million from the sale of our investment in tourmaline and an aggregate gain of 163 million related to the sale of various other oil and gas properties and other assets during the year   interest expense net   interest expense and other increased by 37 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which increased to approximately 41 during the 2011 compared to approximately 38 during 2010 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of 3177 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of 3404 million during 2010 in addition in december 2010 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of 558 weightedaverage fixed rate notes which increased interest expense recognized in 2011   income tax expense   income tax expense increased by 177 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 480 and 479 respectively the effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily pennsylvania as a result of our continued focus on development of our marcellus shale properties       item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    market risk   our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable   derivative instruments and hedging activity   our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the  54      table of contents hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements   periodically we enter into commodity derivative instruments including collar and swap agreements to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures   as of december 31 2012 we had the following outstanding

derivative position at december 31 2012 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk was primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks   during 2012 natural gas and crude oil swaps covered 960 bcf or 38 and 1709 mbbl or 76 of natural gas and crude oil production at an average price of 522 per mcf and 10012 per bbl respectively natural gas basis swaps covered 17 bcf or 7 of our natural gas production at an average price of 025 per mcf natural gas collars with a floor price of 360 per mcf and a ceiling price of 417 per mcf covered 30 bcf or 1 of our natural gas production at an average price of 370 per mcf   we are exposed to market risk on derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal goldman sachs jpmorgan and morgan stanley  55      table of contents  fair

exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs are expensed development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized   exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves the determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical and engineering data if a well is determined to be successful the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well if a well is determined to be unsuccessful the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the period the determination is made if an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production  65      table of contents  1 summary of

only as long as i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future if drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expense   development costs of proved oil and gas properties including estimated dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the unitsofproduction method using proved developed and proved reserves respectively properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years buildings are depreciated on a straightline basis over 25 to 40 years certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over 3 to 10 years   costs of retired sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base partial field are charged to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization if the unitsofproduction rate is not significantly affected accordingly a gain or loss if any is recognized only when a group of proved properties entire field that make up the amortization base has been retired abandoned or sold   the company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights during 2012 2011 and 2010 amortization associated with the companys unproved properties was 181 million 325 million and 476 million respectively and is included in depreciation

the consolidated statement of operations   risk management activities   from time to time the company enters into derivative contracts such as swaps or collars as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its production or other contractual commitments all hedge transactions are subject to the companys risk management policy which does not permit speculative trading activities gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its production or other underlying commitment is hedged as an offset to the specific hedged item cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations if a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge are recognized currently in the results of operations   when the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures or is sold extinguished or terminated derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item for example in the case of natural gas price hedges the gain or loss is reflected in natural gas revenue when a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of operations to the extent the market value changes in the derivative have not been offset by the effects of the price changes on the hedged item since the inception of the hedge   revenue recognition   producer gas imbalances   the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances a natural gas imbalance liability is recorded at the actual price realized upon the gas sale in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet if the companys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties   brokered natural gas margin   revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company realizes brokered margin as a result of buying and selling natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions typically with separate counterparties whereby the company andor the counterparty  67      table

margin in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively   income taxes   the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized   the company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties   the company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and other and accrued penalties related to such positions in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations   stockbased compensation   the company accounts for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate fair value the company uses either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations   the tax benefit for stockbased compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the companys income taxes payable the company did not recognize a tax benefit for stockbased compensation for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010   environmental matters   environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received  68      table of contents  1 summary of significant accounting policies

fair values of assets and liabilities in financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of  100      table of contents  14 fair value measurements continued  these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as follows   level 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level 2 quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  level 3 significant unobservable inputs for use when little or no market data exists requiring a significant degree of judgment    the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in valuation should be chosen   nonfinancial assets and liabilities   the company discloses or recognizes its nonfinancial assets and liabilities such as impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets and asset retirement obligations at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   during the year ended december 31 2010 the company recorded impairment charges related to certain oil and gas properties and other assets refer to note 2 for additional disclosures related to fair value associated with the impaired assets as none of the companys other nonfinancial assets and liabilities were impaired as of december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 and no other fair value measurements were required to be recognized on a nonrecurring basis additional disclosures were not provided   the estimated fair value of the companys asset retirement obligation at inception is determined by utilizing the income approach by applying a creditadjusted riskfree rate which takes into account the companys credit risk the time value of money and the current economic state to the undiscounted expected abandonment cash flows given the unobservable nature of the inputs the measurement of the asset retirement obligation is deemed to use level 3 inputs  101      table of contents  14 fair value measurements continued   financial assets and liabilities   our

should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures   estimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 were based on studies performed by the companys petroleum engineering staff the estimates were computed using the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the respective year the estimates were audited by miller and lents ltd who indicated that based on their investigation and subject to the limitations described in their audit letter they believe the results of those estimates and projections were reasonable in the aggregate   no major discovery or other favorable or unfavorable event after december 31 2012 is believed to have caused a material change in the estimates of proved or proved developed reserves as of
