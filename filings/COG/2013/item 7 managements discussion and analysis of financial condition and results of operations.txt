    the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material   overview   on an equivalent basis our production in 2012 increased by 43 from 2011 we produced 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 compared to 1875 bcfe or 5137 mmcfe per day in 2011 natural gas production increased by 744 bcf or 42 to 2532 bcf in 2012 compared to 1788 bcf in 2011 this increase was primarily the result of increased production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale was the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 along with decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to liquids drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 964 mbbls or 67 from 1443 mbbls in 2011 to 2407 mbbls in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of increased production resulting from our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma   our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2012 was 367 per mcf 18 lower than the 446 per mcf price realized in 2011 our average realized crude oil price for 2012 was 10165 per bbl 12 higher than the 9049 per bbl price realized in 2011 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of crude oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a   we drilled 170 gross wells with a success rate of 98 in 2012 compared to 161 gross wells with a success rate of 99 in 2011 our 2012 total capital and exploration spending was 9785 million compared to 9055 million in 2011 this increase in spending was substantially driven by an expanded marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania the eagle ford shale in south texas including a portion towards the pearsall shale and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma in both 2012 and 2011 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2013 our 2013 drilling program includes between 9500 million and 10 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility  38      table of contents  financial condition   capital resources and liquidity   our primary sources of cash in 2012 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties and other assets during the year and borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures in addition to repayments of debt and related interest final contributions to fund the liquidation of our pension plan and dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements                         year ended december 31      in thousands     2012    2011    2010       cash flows provided by

operating activities in 2012 increased by 1503 million over 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was partially offset by changes in working capital and longterm assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices equivalent production volumes increased by 43 for 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 18 for 2012 compared to 2011 while average realized crude oil prices increased by 12 compared to the same period   net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 increased by 169 million over 2010 this increase was primarily due to increased operating income in 2011 as a result of higher operating revenues that outpaced the increase in operating expenses excluding noncash expenses this increase was offset by changes in working capital which decreased operating cash flows the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 44 in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 22 in 2011 compared to 2010 and average realized crude oil prices decreased by 8 over the same period  39      table of contents  see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods   investing activities   the primary use of cash in investing activities was capital and exploration expenditures we established our budget for these amounts based on our current estimate of future commodity prices and cash flows due to the volatility of commodity prices and new opportunities which may arise our capital expenditures may be periodically adjusted during any given year   cash flows used in investing activities increased by 2779 million from 2011 to 2012 and decreased by 1261 million from 2010 to 2011 the increase from 2011 to 2012 was due to a decrease of 2343 million of proceeds from the sale of assets an increase of 367 million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of 69 million associated with our equity investment in constitution the decrease from 2010 to 2011 was due to an increase of 1601 million of proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by an increase of 340 million in capital and exploration expenditures   financing activities   cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 1545 million from 2011 to 2012 this was primarily due to 1620 million of higher net borrowings 700 million increase in borrowings and 920 million decrease in repayment of debt partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 42 million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 40 million cash flows used in financing activities increased by 1849 million from 2010 to 2011 this was primarily due to a decrease in net borrowings of 1950 million partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 128 million   at december 31 2012 we had 3250 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 compared to 1880 million of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 49 at december 31 2011 as of december 31 2012 we had 5740 million available for future borrowings under our credit facility   in may 2012 we amended our credit facility to adjust the margins associated with borrowings under the facility and extended the maturity date from september 2015 to may 2017 the credit facility as amended provides for an available credit line of 900 million and contains a 500 million accordion feature whereby we may increase the available credit line to 14 billion if one or more of the existing banks or new banks agree to provide such increased commitment amount as of december 31 2012 the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was 17 billion see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details   we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash on hand and availability under our credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plans and maintain our strong financial position  40      table of contents  capitalization   information about our capitalization is as follows                      december 31      dollars in thousands     2012    2011

outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively   for the year ended december 31 2012 we paid dividends of 168 million 008 per share on our common stock a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990   capital and exploration expenditures   on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year   the following table presents major components of our capital and exploration expenditures                         year ended december 31      in thousands

145 net in 2013 compared to 170 gross wells 1178 net drilled in 2012 this 2013 drilling program includes between approximately 9500 million and 10 billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately 120 million to constitution compared to 9785 million in 2012 we expect our capital spending in 2013 to be consistent with that of 2012 based on our estimate of natural gas and crude oil prices over the next year we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly  41      table of contents  contractual obligations   a summary of our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 are set forth in the following

1interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates of our 11 billion longterm debt outstanding including current maturities at december 31 2012 interest payments on our revolving credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2012 outstanding balance of 3250 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date a constant interest rate of 22 was assumed which was the december 31 2012 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 2for further information on our obligations under transportation agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 3for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements   amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2012 was 670 million see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details   we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations   potential impact of our critical accounting policies   readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below   successful efforts method of accounting   we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized  42                table of contents   oil and gas reserves   the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves   our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller amp lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8   our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa rate   in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future   carrying value of oil and gas properties   we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves also potentially including riskadjusted probable and possible reserves from time to time are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property  43      table of contents lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 23 million or decrease by approximately 18 million respectively per year   as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program   asset retirement obligation   the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities   under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations   our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks  44      table of contents  employee benefit plans   our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our employee benefit plans   stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is usually the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation   recent accounting pronouncements   in december 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update require enhanced disclosures around financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either 1 offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or 2 subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement irrespective of whether they are offset in accordance with either asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 an entity should provide the disclosures required by those amendments retrospectively for all comparative periods presented the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   in january 2013 the fasb issued asu no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities the amendments in this update clarify that the scope of asu 201111 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging including bifurcated embedded derivatives repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset in accordance with asc 2102045 or asc 8151045 or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement the amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 this guidance will primarily impact our disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives we do not expect this guidance to have any impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows  45      table of contents  other issues and contingencies   regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations   restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our senior notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2012 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and senior notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation   operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate   commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results   the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions   results of operations   2012 and 2011 compared   we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 063 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an  46      table of contents increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices and higher operating costs   revenue price and volume variances   below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances                           year ended december 31    variance

follows   direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase are higher employee related and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs  transportation and gathering increased by 700 million primarily due higher throughput due to an increase in production and higher transportation rates coupled with the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012 primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas  brokered natural gas decreased by 153 million from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income increased 213 million primarily due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011  exploration increased 10 million primarily due to an increase in exploration expense as the result of increased activity partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data  depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1083 million with a 1314 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an 85 million decrease due to a lower ddampa rate this increase was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 144 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 2012   49                     table of contents    general and administrative increased by 166 million primarily due to 140 million higher pension expense associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012 and higher legal costs and professional fees of 60 million also contributing to the increase was the accrual of 19 million associated with fines and penalties assessed by the office of natural resources revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters which we are currently disputing related to properties we no longer own and a 22 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by 63 million of lower stockbased compensation expense primarily associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011   gain  loss on sale of assets    during 2012 we recognized an aggregate gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas during the 2011 an aggregate gain of 634 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east texas and the sale of other noncore assets    interest expense net    interest expense and other decreased by 34 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which decreased to approximately 30 during 2012 compared to approximately 41 during 2011 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on weightedaverage debt of 2838 million in 2012 compared to weightedaverage debt of 3177 million in 2011   income tax expense   income tax expense decreased by 67 million in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income the effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 446 and 480 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes   2011 and 2010 compared   we reported net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 059 per share compared to net income of 1034 million or 050 per share for 2010 the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices and higher operating costs  50      table

associated with the remediation of certain wells in northeast pennsylvania as a result of the padep consent order and settlement agreement offsetting these increases were lower lease maintenance subsurface lease maintenance and plugging and abandonment costs in 2011 compared to 2010 coupled with lower compression expenses primarily due to the sale of our gathering system in northeast

primarily in northeast pennsylvania  brokered natural gas decreased by 126 million from 2010 to 2011 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysis  taxes other than income decreased 103 million due to decreased production taxes as a result of tax refunds and credits received in 2011 on qualifying wells lower ad valorem tax expense due to lower natural gas prices and

partially offset by higher dry hole costs in 2011 related to an exploratory dry hole in montana  depreciation depletion and amortization increased by 161 million of which 298 million was due to increased depreciation and depletion from increased capital spending and higher equivalent production volumes offset by a lower ddampa rate and a 14 million increase in accretion of asset retirement obligations the increase in depreciation and depletion was partially offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 151 million primarily due to a decrease in amortization rates due to a shift in our drilling and development activities  impairment of oil and gas properties decreased by 409 million from 2011 to 2010 due to the impairment of two south texas fields recognized as a result of commodity price declines and   53      table of contents   limited activity and the impairment of drilling and service equipment in 2010 there were no impairments in 2011    general and administrative increased by 255 million primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation expense of 251 million primarily associated with the mark to market of the liability portion of our performance shares due to changes in our stock price in 2011 compared 2010 higher incentive compensation and fringe benefits also contributed to the increase these increases are partially offset by lower legal and professional costs associated with the padep consent order and settlement agreement executed in 2010    gain  loss on sale of assets   during 2011 we recognized a gain of 342 million from the sale of oil and gas properties in east texas and an aggregate gain of 292 million related to the sale of various other noncore assets during 2010 we recognized a gain of 493 million from the

properties and other assets during the year   interest expense net   interest expense and other increased by 37 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which increased to approximately 41 during the 2011 compared to approximately 38 during 2010 partially offset by a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings under our credit facility based on average daily balances of 3177 million during 2011 compared to average daily balances of 3404 million during 2010 in addition in december 2010 we issued 175 million aggregate principal amount of 558 weightedaverage fixed rate notes which increased interest expense recognized in 2011   income tax expense   income tax expense increased by 177 million in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased pretax income and a slightly higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2011 and 2010 were 480 and 479 respectively the effective tax rate was slightly higher primarily due to an increase in our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes mainly due to a continued shift in our state apportionment factors to higher rate states primarily pennsylvania as a result of our continued focus on development of our marcellus shale properties
