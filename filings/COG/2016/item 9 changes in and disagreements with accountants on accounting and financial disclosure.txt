order to achieve economic flow ratesundeveloped reserves undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves

drilling and production operations6table of contentspart iitems 1 and 2 business and propertiescabot oil amp gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvaniastrategy our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in production and reserves we believe this is attainable even in the current commodity price environment by employing a combination of disciplined management and remaining focused on our core asset base which offers a strategic advantage key components of our business strategy includedisciplined capital spending focused on organic projects we allocate our capital program based on economic projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows with any shortfalls funded by borrowings under our revolving credit facility while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost repeatable drilling opportunities the price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in the capital investments we make in order to develop our properties low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in our core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices from time to time we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and select asset salespursue strategic marketing and transportation agreements to maximize cash flows and diversify risk we continue to pursue opportunities to maximize our cash flows and diversify our market and customer risk by securing strategic longterm firm transportation and sales contracts in close proximity to our core area of operations  2016 outlook our 2016 drilling program includes approximately 3250 million in capital expenditures and approximately 1500 million in expected contributions to our equity method investments we expect to fund these expenditures with operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our equity method investments in constitution pipeline company llc constitution and meade pipeline co llc meadewe plan to drill approximately 30 gross wells 300 net in 2016 compared to 142 gross wells 1328 net drilled in 2015 we allocate our planned capital program among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital expenditures accordingly as a result of sustained lower natural gas and crude oil prices expected during 2016 we reduced our budgeted capital expenditures compared to 2015 in addition we plan to operate an average of approximately 13 rigs in 2016 a decrease from an average of approximately 54 rigs in 2015 during 2015 we strategically curtailed production levels in the marcellus shale due to lower price realizations in the region and we expect to continue to strategically curtail production during 2016 given the current commodity price environment 7table of contentsdescription of propertiesour exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional playsthe marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united statesmarcellus shaleour marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county pennsylvania where we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2015 net production in the marcellus shale was 5408 bcfe representing approximately 90 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2015 we had a total of 5481 net wells in the marcellus shale of which approximately 99 are operated by usduring 2015 we invested 4570 million in the marcellus shale and drilled or participated in drilling 825 net wells and turned in line 640 net wells as of december 31 2015 we had 668 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we

to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas and the utica shale in pennsylvania other propertiesancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems four local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2015 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our systemwe also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia8table of contentsacquisitionsin december 2014 we completed the acquisition of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 305 million total cash consideration paid was approximately 299 million which reflects the impact of customary purchase price adjustments and acquisition costsin october 2014 we purchased certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the eagle ford shale in south texas for approximately 2100 million total cash consideration paid at closing was approximately

of 506 millionin 2011 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties and other assets for approximately 4055 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 634 millionmarketing substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple marketswe also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or use purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contractsto date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production risk management from time to time we use derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements designed to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas or crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreementduring 2015 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 386 to 391 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 427 to 443 per mcf covered 709 bcf or 13 of our natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 387 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1073 bcf or 19 of our natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 379 per mcf 9table of contentsas of december 31 2015 we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives in january 2016 we entered into natural gas swaps covering 520 bcf of our expected natural gas production from april 2016 through october 2016 at a weightedaverage price of 251 per mcf a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2016 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable we will continue to evaluate the benefit of using derivatives in the future please read managements discussion

current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties preliminary investigations of record title are made at the time of lease acquisition complete investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties14table of contentscompetition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and we experience strong competition in our primary producing areas we primarily compete with integrated independent and other energy companies for the sale and transportation of our oil and natural gas production to marketing companies and end users furthermore the oil and gas industry competes with other energy industries that supply fuel and power to industrial commercial and residential consumers many of these competitors have greater financial technical and personnel resources the effect of these competitive factors cannot be predictedprice contract terms availability of rigs and related equipment and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place major customers during the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 two customers accounted for approximately 16 and 14 two customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 and four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 respectively of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily availableseasonalitydemand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter monthsregulation of oil and natural gas exploration and productionexploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industrynatural gas marketing gathering and transportationfederal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program15table of contentssome of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 18 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petitionin 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for 500000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 124mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity on december 2 2014 the ferc issued a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the construction and operation of the pipeline project while ferc has issued the certificate the project scope or timeline for construction and eventual inservice date may still be impacted by the public regulatory permitting process when placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga additionally in 2014 we executed a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for 850000 dth per day of pipeline capacity and acquired a 20 equity interest in meade which was formed to construct a pipeline with transco from susquehanna county pennsylvania to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania the proposed pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by the ferc under the nga transco filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the ferc on march 31 2015 and is currently seeking various federal and state approvals authorizing construction and operation of the pipelineour production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basisin light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gasfederal regulation of swap transactionswe use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions 16table of contentsincluding certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an enduser exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of doddfrank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictablefederal regulation of petroleumour sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferentialeffective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates by which adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2015 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 123 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2016 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline indexpipeline safety regulationcertain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle began during 2013in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulationsin december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and 17table of contentsreport on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 including revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dotthe cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance on october 1 2015 the us department of transportations pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that specifies anomaly and repair timeframes which currently are left entirely to the operators discretion the nopr proposes to require that certain repairs be made immediately specifically dents located on the bottom of the pipeline that have any indication of metal loss cracking or a stress riser as well as situations in which the pipelines calculated burst pressure is less than 11 times the maximum operating pressure at the location of an anomaly would both be categorized as immediate repair conditions the nopr also proposes to include a general requirement for performing all other repairs within a reasonable timein the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulationsenvironmental and safety regulationsgeneral  our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to usus laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environmentsolid and hazardous waste  we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contaminationwe generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be 18table of contentsdesignated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter todaysuperfund  the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been releasedoil pollution act  the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulationsendangered species act  the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected statesclean water act  the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulationsclean air act  our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulationssome of our producing wells and associated facilities are subject to restrictive air emission limitations and permitting requirements in 2012 the epa published final new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap that amended the existing nsps and neshap standards for oil and gas facilities and created new nsps standards for oil and natural gas production transmission and distribution facilities with a compliance deadline of january 1 2015 while these rules remain in effect the epa announced in 2013 that it would reexamine and reissue the rules over the next three years the epa has issued updated rules regarding storage tanks and additional rules are expected in december 2014 the epa issued additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion of hydraulically fractured wells and clarified that storage tanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in july 2015 the epa finalized two further updates to these rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another referred to as 19table of contentsconnected in parallel in september 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry the epa also issued a proposed rule in september 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry if we are unable to comply with air pollution regulations or to obtain permits for emissions associated with our operations we could be required to forego construction modification or certain operations these regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate and result in administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects including the construction and operation of facilities safe drinking water act  the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the states environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilitieshydraulic fracturing  many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluids usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives as well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the formation that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal state and local levels have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and natural gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing the adoption of federal state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and natural gas wells and increased compliance costs which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1agreenhouse gas  in response to studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act this includes proposed regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant portion of our costs related to complying with current and future regulations relating to climate change and ghgs it could materially affect our operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital future legislation or regulations adopted to address climate change could also make our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy please read risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation

and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas and oil that we sell lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices natural gas prices based on the twelvemonth average of the first of the month henry hub index price were 259 per mmbtu in 2015 compared to 435 per mmbtu in 2014 and have continued to decline to 219 per mmbtu in february 2016 oil prices based on the nymex monthly average price were 5028 per barrel in 2015 compared to 9499 per barrel in 2014 and have continued to decline to 3178 in january 2016 low prices throughout 2015 have had and any substantial or extended decline in future natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect our future business financial condition results of operations cash flows liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments furthermore substantial extended decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets increase our costs under our revolving credit facility and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans see risk factorsrecent commodity price declines have resulted in an impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these

effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary 22table of contentsfrom our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors includingthe results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of seismic datathe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospectsthe approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiledeconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crewsour financial resources and results andthe availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permitsthese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oilour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understatedreserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same dataresults of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reservesyou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties the present value of future cash flows are based on 181 per mcf of natural gas 1298 per bbl of natural gas liquids and 4710 per bbl of oil as of december 31 2015 actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in generalrecent commodity price declines have resulted in further impairment of our oil and gas properties and future natural gas and oil price declines may result in additional writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties for example in december 2015 we recorded an impairment of approximately 1149 million associated with oil and gas properties in certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 because our reserves are predominately natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil prices we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash 23table of contentsflows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the futureour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverablein general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economicallyour reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2015 will decrease at a rate of 13 27 20 and 16 during 2016 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typicalexploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserveswe have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at allwe rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenuesrisks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operationsas of december 31 2015 we had approximately 20 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future increases in our level of indebtedness mayrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunitieslimit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants including restrictions on incurring additional debt making certain investments and paying dividendsplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations depending on the levels of our outstanding debt limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures general corporate and other purposes andincrease our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy including further declines in prices for natural gas and oilin addition the interest rates that we pay on our senior unsecured notes and the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio and our asset coverage ratio accordingly increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our earnings or the present value of our reserves or decreases in our earnings or the present value of 24table of contentsour natural gas and oil reserves without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness will result in an increase in our interest expenseour debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios if the price that we receive for our natural gas and oil production further deteriorates from current levels or continues for an extended period it could lead to further reduced revenues cash flow and earnings which in turn could lead to a default under the ratios described above because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period a prolonged period of decreased natural gas and oil prices or a further decline could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios in order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants we may seek to reduce our capital expenditure plan sell nonstrategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements in addition we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all for more information about our debt agreements please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial condition capital resources and liquiditythe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced in light of recent commodity price declines which could limit us in the futurethe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently 34 billion and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are 18 billion the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower natural gas or oil prices operating difficulties declines in reserves lending requirements or regulations the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason in the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base in addition we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets including the market for senior unsecured notes to meet our obligations including any such debt repayment obligations strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rateour future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2016 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2016 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectivesnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operationsnegative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business25table of contentsour ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processingthe sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons in addition at current commodity prices construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our businessfor example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing businessour operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20142016 national enforcement initiative ensuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilitiesacquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilitiessuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arisethere may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we often assume certain liabilities and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the 26table of contentsnature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing propertiesthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operationsthe integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties includethe challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our businessthe inability to retain key employees of the acquired businesspotential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties andthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectationsthe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could sufferwe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial lossesour business involves a variety of operating risks includingwell site blowouts cratering

in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to usour operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2015 we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance27table of contentswe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposedwe maintain insurance against some but not all operating risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowswe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operateother companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest as of december 31 2015 nonoperated wells represented approximately 87 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 26 of our owned net wells we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future coststerrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our businessthe threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive positioncompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxationwe may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to manage price risk more effectivelythe collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including whenthere is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production production is less than expected or 28table of contentsa counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligationsthe cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictablewe will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivativesthe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operateour operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmedfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development including hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delaysmost of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover in may 2014 the epa announced an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to data collection including the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing further in march 2015 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land however enforcement of the rule has been delayed pending a decision in a legal challenge in the us district court of wyoming we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorgon august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards nsps to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves in december 2014 the epa finalized additional amendments to these rules that among other things distinguished between multiple flowback stages during completion and clarified that storage 29table of contentstanks permanently removed from service are not affected by any requirements in july 2015 the epa finalized two updates to the rules addressing the definition of low pressure gas wells and references to tanks that are connected to one another in september 2015 the epa issued a proposed rule that would update and expand the nsps by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry the epa also issued a proposed rule in september 2015 concerning aggregation of sources that would affect source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements and potential methane regulation may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business similarly aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex costly and time consuming air permitting particularly in regard to obtaining preconstruction permits the proposed aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the city of denton texas adopted a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in november 2014 though it was later lifted in 2015 and new york issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in june 2015 in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to among other things increase civil penalties and strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits although the pennsylvania supreme court struck down portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state additional challenges to act 13 are pending before the pennsylvania supreme court however the timing of any decision is uncertain we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in april 2015 the epa published proposed pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposala number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a draft report in june 2015 it concluded that activities have not led to widespread systematic impacts on drinking water resources in the united states but there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing could affect drinking water resources this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce climate change the costs that may be associated with its effects and the regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emissions have the potential to affect our business in many ways including increasing the costs to provide our products and services reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services due to change in both costs and weather patterns and the economic health of the regions in which we operate all of which can create financial risks in addition legislative and regulatory responses related to ghg emissions and climate change may increase our operating costs the united states congress has previously considered legislation related to ghg emissions there have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in ghg emissions for example in november 2014 the obama administration announced an 30table of contentsagreement with china to voluntarily reduce ghg emissions by 26 to 28 of 2005 levels by 2025 further the united states joined over 190 countries in lima peru in december 2014 and agreed to draft an emissions reduction plan ahead of further international climate negotiations in paris france in 2015 the united states was actively involved in the negotiations in paris which led to the creation of the paris agreement the paris agreement will be open for signing on april 22 2016 and will require countries to review and represent a progression in their intended nationally determined contributions which set emissions reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 the paris agreement sets a goal of keeping warming well below 2 degrees celsius and sets a target limit of 15 degrees celsius in addition increased public awareness and concern may result in more state regional andor federal requirements to reduce or mitigate ghg emissions for example in june 2013 the obama administration announced its climate action plan which among other things directs federal agencies to develop a strategy for the reduction of methane emissions including emissions from the oil and gas sector pursuant to this plan the epa issued a proposed rule updating new source performance standards and setting requirements for methane emissions and volatile organic compounds in the oil and gas sector in september 2015 in september 2009 the epa finalized a mandatory ghg reporting rule that requires large sources of ghg emissions to monitor maintain records on and annually report their ghg emissions beginning january 1 2010 the rule applies to large facilities emitting 25000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxideequivalent co2e emissions per year and to most upstream suppliers of fossil fuels as well as manufacturers of vehicles and engines subsequently in november 2010 the epa issued ghg monitoring and reporting regulations that went into effect on december 30 2010 specifically for oil and natural gas facilities including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2e per year the rule required reporting of ghg emissions by regulated facilities to the epa by march 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter we are required to report our ghg emissions to the epa each year in march under this rule and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline the epa also issued a final rule that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for ghg emissions beginning in 2011 under the caa however in june 2014 the us supreme court in uarg v epa limited the application of the ghg permitting requirements under the prevention of significant deterioration and title v permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutantsfederal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative civil andor criminal penalties for noncompliance with air permits or other requirements of the caa and associated state laws and regulations in addition the passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities ii install new emission controls on our facilities and iii administer and manage any ghg emissions program if we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition to the extent financial markets view climate change and ghg emissions as a financial risk this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events in addition warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliablecertain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flowssubstantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business31table of contentsprovisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investmentour charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directorsthe personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charterthe delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter

protection padep relating to gas migration allegations in an area surrounding several wells owned and operated by us in susquehanna county pennsylvania the allegations relating to these wells were initially raised by residents in the area in august 2011 we received a notice of violation from the padep in september 2011 for failure to prevent the migration of gas into fresh groundwater sources in the area surrounding these wells since then we have been engaged with the padep in investigating the incident and have performed appropriate remediation efforts including the provision of alternative sources of drinking water to affected residents we believe the source of methane has been remediated and are working with the padep to reach agreement on the disposition of this matter the proposed consent order and agreement is the culmination of this effort and if finalized would result in the payment of a civil monetary penalty in an amount likely to exceed 100000 up to approximately 300000 we will continue to work with the padep to finalize the consent order and agreement and bring this matter to a closefrom time to time we receive notices of violation from governmental and regulatory authorities in areas in which we operate relating to alleged violations of environmental statutes or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder while we cannot predict with certainty

overview operating results for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 are as follows equivalent production in 2015 increased 707 bcfe or 13 from 5318 bcfe or 15 bcfe per day in 2014 to 6025 bcfe or 17 bcfe per day in 2015 natural gas production increased 579 bcf or 11 from 5080 bcf in 2014 to 5660 bcf in 2015 primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania crude oilcondensatengl production increased 21 mmbbls or 54 from 40 mmbbls in 2014 to 61 mmbbls in 2015 as a result of higher production associated with our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas asset acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014average realized natural gas price for 2015 was 215 per mcf 34 lower than the 328 per mcf price realized in 2014 average realized crude oil price for 2015 was 4572 per bbl 48 lower than the 8850 per bbl price realized in 2014 drilled 142 gross wells 1328 net with a success rate of 1000 in 2015 compared to 200 gross wells 1765 net with a success rate of 995 in 2014 total capital spending was approximately 7769 in 2015 compared to 16 billion excluding the south texas asset acquisitions in 2014 average rig count during 2015 was approximately 35 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 19 rigs in the eagle ford shale compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 60 rigs and approximately 28 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2014market conditions and commodity pricesour financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by weather conditions pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our derivative and hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationcommodity prices continued to decline during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices we tested the recoverability of the carrying value of all of our oil and gas properties and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 1149 million associated with certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana based on the results of our impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas 37table of contentsproperties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be requiredwe believe we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in the lower commodity pricing environment and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices bycontinuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by reducing our capital expenditures and number of wells drilled compared to the prior year continuing to optimize our drilling completion and operational efficiencies resulting in lower operating costs per unit of productioncontinuing to manage our balance sheet with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenantscontinuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil productionfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidityour primary sources of cash in 2015 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash floweffective april 17 2015 we amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date from may 2017 to april 2020 and to change the mechanism under which interest rate margins are determined for outstanding borrowings the revolving credit facility as amended provides for a borrowing base of 34 billion and commitments of 18 billion the amended credit facility also provides for an accordion feature which allows us to increase the available credit line up to an additional 500 million if one or more of the existing or new banks agree to provide such increased amount the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties due to the significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant in addition the amendments to our senior notes provide for potential increases in coupon rates ranging from 0 to 125 basis points depending on the asset coverage and leverage ratios at the end of the respective quarterly period in addition the amendment to our revolving credit facility increased the maximum margins we pay on borrowings under the credit facility see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the amendmentsas a result of the recent decline in commodity prices our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility could be reduced in the future unless commodity prices continue to decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plansat december 31 2015 and 2014 we had 4130 million and 1400 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility respectively as of december 31 2015 we had unused commitments of 14 billion under our revolving credit facilitywe were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as amended for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes as of december 31 2015 see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt38table of contentscash flowsour cash

activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital spending our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had working capital deficits of 908 million and 856 million respectively we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirementsnet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by 4957 million when compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34 and 48 respectively for 2015 compared to 2014 equivalent production volumes increased by 13 for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by 2119 million over 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and an increase in working capital the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 29 for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas in the marcellus shale and oil production in the eagle ford shale average realized natural gas

1031 of the internal revenue code financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 1938 million from 2014 to 2015 due to 3320 million of lower net borrowings and an

are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates successful efforts method of accountingwe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 41table of contentsoil and gas reservesthe process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisionsour reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa ratein addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future based on the results of our impairment test of all of our oil and gas properties and the resulting impairment charge of approximately 1149 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be requiredcarrying value of oil and gas propertieswe evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life 42table of contentsdecreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 105 million or decrease by approximately 80 million respectively per yearas these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development programasset retirement obligationsthe majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expenseaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesunder applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of

operations the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksour financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials income taxeswe make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertaintieswe believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realizedour effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our

decrease in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125 to 10 which increases back to the preamended ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 475 to 10 through and including december 31 2016 under the terms of the respective agreements the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 425 to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 35 to 10 beginning on march 31 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard amp poors ratings services sampp or moodys investor service inc moodys at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditionscommodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil pricesthe majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditionsresults of operations2015 and 2014 comparedwe reported a net loss for 2015 of 1139 million or 028 per share compared to net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties 45table of

are as followsdirect operations decreased 47 million largely due to cost reductions from suppliers improved operational efficiencies and lower workover and plugging and abandonment expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 transportation and gathering increased 783 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements throughout 2014brokered natural gas decreased 174 million from 2014 to 2015 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysistaxes other than income decreased 42 million due to 59 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil and condensate revenues and 08 million lower drilling impact fees due to a decrease in our marcellus shale drilling activities these decreases were partially offset by 20 million higher ad valorem taxes due to increased activity and the assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 in south texas and 06 million higher franchise taxesexploration decreased 13 million as a result of lower exploratory dry hole costs of 45 million and 24 million lower geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses due to reduced activity these decreases were partially offset by a 51 million charge related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas in the first half of 2015 depreciation depletion and amortization decreased 105 million of which 1173 million was due to a lower ddampa rate of 093 per mcfe for 2015 compared to 113 per mcfe for 2014 partially offset by 799 million due to higher equivalent production volumes the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with higher ddampa rate fields in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 240 million as a result of ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in late 2014 accretion expense increased 18 million due to the acquisition of proved properties in south texas in late 2014 and an increase in asset retirement obligations as a result of revisions of previous estimates recorded in fourth quarter 2014 48table of contentsimpairment of oil and gas properties was 1149 million in 2015 due to the impairment of certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 in 2014 we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of 7710 million related to certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the then current price environments general and administrative decreased 131 million due to lower stockbased

texasinterest expense interest expense increased 231 million due to 241 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 17 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 3472 million compared to approximately 4100 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively income tax expense benefit income tax benefit increased 13 million due to lower pretax income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 392 and 2224 respectively the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 we expect our 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 370 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state tax rates that occur during the year as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers2014 and 2013 comparedwe reported net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share compared to net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase

13551table of contentstotal costs and expenses from operations increased by 8699 million from 2013 to 2014 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as followsdirect operations increased 47 million largely due to higher operating costs as a result of higher production an increase in disposal and recycling costs related to our marcellus shale operations and an increase in costs associated with oil processing and related fuel charges related to our eagle ford shale operations partially offsetting these increases were lower costs associated with certain noncore assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013transportation and gathering increased 1198 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements in late 2013 and during 2014brokered natural gas increased 01 million from 2013 to 2014 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysistaxes other than income increased 40 million due to 25 million higher drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities 25 million higher production taxes and 09 million higher franchise and other taxes production taxes increased due to higher oil production in south texas offset by taxes associated with certain noncore assets in oklahoma and west texas that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2013 these increases are partially offset by a 19 million decrease in ad valorem taxesexploration increased 106 million as a result of higher exploratory dry hole costs of 75 million and higher geophysical and geological and other exploration expensesdepreciation depletion and amortization decreased 183 million due to a 362 million decrease in amortization of unproved properties in 2014 due to lower amortization rates as a result of favorable results from our drilling program in pennsylvania this decrease was partially offset by a net increase in depreciation and depletion of 146 million consisting of a 1676 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2014 compared to 2013 partially offset by a decrease of 1530 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 113 per mcfe for 2014 compared to 142 per mcfe for 2013 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impact of the disposition of higher rate fields in oklahoma and west texas in the fourth quarter of 2013 impairment of oil and gas properties was 7710 million in 2014 due to the impairment of certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the current price environment there was no impairment in 2013general and administrative decreased 220 million due to lower stockbased compensation expense of 304 million associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards and our supplemental employee incentive plan due to changes in our stock price during 2014 compared to 2013 and lower employeerelated expenses these decreases were partially offset by increases in professional feesearnings loss on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings loss is the result of the increase in our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2014 compared to 2013 gain loss on sale of assets during 2014 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 171 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2013 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties in 2013 for a gain of 195 million interest expense interest expense increased 77 million as a result of an increase in interest expense of 97 million associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 higher commitment fees of 23 million and increased amortization of debt issuance costs of 11 52table of contentsmillion these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 31 million due to the repayment of 750 million of our 733 weightedaverage senior notes in july 2013 and 11 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 4100 million compared to approximately 4544 million during 2014 and 2013 respectivelyincome tax expense benefitincome tax expense decreased 2778 million due to lower pretax income and a lower effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2014 and 2013 were 2224 and 424 respectively the overall effective tax rate was lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskmarket riskour primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and spot market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictablederivative instruments and risk management activitiesour risk management strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets through the use of commodity derivatives a committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our risk management activities our commodity derivatives generally cover a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection by limiting the benefit to us of increases in prices while protecting us in the event of price declines further if any of our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the full benefit of our commodity derivatives please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our derivative and risk management activitiesperiodically we enter into commodity derivatives including collar and swap agreements to protect against exposure to price declines related to our natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futuresas of december 31 2015 we did not have any outstanding commodity derivatives in january 2016 we entered into natural gas swaps covering 520 bcf of our expected natural gas production from april 2016 through october 2016 at a weightedaverage price of 251 per mcf a significant portion of our expected natural gas and crude oil production for 2016 and beyond is currently unhedged and directly exposed to the volatility in natural gas and crude oil market prices whether favorable or unfavorable during 2015 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 386 to 391 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 427 to 443 per mcf covered 709 bcf or 13 of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 387 per mcf natural gas swaps covered 1073 bcf or 19 of natural gas production at a weightedaverage price of 379 per mcf we are exposed to market risk on commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller our counterparties are primarily commercial banks and financial service institutions that management believes present minimal credit risk and our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty we perform both quantitative and qualitative assessments of these counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable we have not incurred any losses related to nonperformance risk 53table of contentsof our counterparties and we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties however we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future the preceding paragraphs contain forwardlooking information concerning future production and projected gains and losses which may be impacted both by production and by changes in the future commodity prices see forwardlooking information for further detailsfair value of other financial instrumentsthe estimated fair value of financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amount reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments cash and cash equivalents are classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchywe use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the fair value of debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all senior notes and the revolving credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us the carrying amount and fair value of debt is as follows  december 31

company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation

primarily options and swaps to manage its exposure to price fluctuations on a portion of its anticipated future natural gas and oil production the companys credit agreement restricts the ability of the company to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which the company has actual or projected exposure or as permitted under the companys risk management policies and where such derivatives do not subject the company to material speculative risks all of the companys derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposesall derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value at the end of each quarterly period these derivatives are markedtomarket if the derivative does not qualify or is not designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in income if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effectivefor derivatives that qualify and are designated as a cash flow hedges the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production occurs if the company determines that it is probable that a forecasted hedged transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in income immediatelygains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are included in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues gains and losses on derivatives which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivatives not designated or that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activitiesfair value of assets and liabilities the company follows the authoritative accounting guidance for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities in its financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as followslevel 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2 quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilitylevel 3 significant unobservable inputs for use when little or no market data exists requiring a significant degree of judgmentthe hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in the valuation should be chosenrevenue recognition natural gas and oil sales result from interests in oil and gas

accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realizedthe company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon

reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosuresestimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were based on studies performed by the

to proved oil and gas reservesthe following information has been developed based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the companys engineering staff it can be used for some comparisons but should not be the only method used to evaluate the company or its performance further the information in the following table may not represent realistic assessments of future cash flows nor should the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows standardized measure be viewed as representative of the current value of the companythe company believes that the following factors should be taken into account when reviewing the following informationfuture costs and selling prices will differ from those required to be used in these calculationsdue to future market conditions and governmental regulations actual rates of production in future years may vary significantly from the rate of production assumed in the calculationsselection of a 10 discount rate is arbitrary and may not be a reasonable measure of the relative risk that is part of realizing future net oil and gas revenuesfuture net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation96table of contentsunder the standardized measure future cash inflows were estimated by using the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the yearthe average prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials related to proved reserves are as follows   year
