the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this materialoverviewoperating overview operating results for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to the year ended december 31 2014 are as follows equivalent production in 2015 increased 707 bcfe or 13 from 5318 bcfe or 15 bcfe per day in 2014 to 6025 bcfe or 17 bcfe per day in 2015 natural gas production increased 579 bcf or 11 from 5080 bcf in 2014 to 5660 bcf in 2015 primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program in pennsylvania crude oilcondensatengl production increased 21 mmbbls or 54 from 40 mmbbls in 2014 to 61 mmbbls in 2015 as a result of higher production associated with our oilfocused eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and production associated with the south texas asset acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2014average realized natural gas price for 2015 was 215 per mcf 34 lower than the 328 per mcf price realized in 2014 average realized crude oil price for 2015 was 4572 per bbl 48 lower than the 8850 per bbl price realized in 2014 drilled 142 gross wells 1328 net with a success rate of 1000 in 2015 compared to 200 gross wells 1765 net with a success rate of 995 in 2014 total capital spending was approximately 7769 in 2015 compared to 16 billion excluding the south texas asset acquisitions in 2014 average rig count during 2015 was approximately 35 rigs in the marcellus shale and approximately 19 rigs in the eagle ford shale compared to an average rig count in the marcellus shale of approximately 60 rigs and approximately 28 rigs in the eagle ford shale during 2014market conditions and commodity pricesour financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms commodity prices are affected by many factors outside of our control including changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by weather conditions pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors in addition our realized prices are further impacted by our derivative and hedging activities as a result we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices will have on our capital program production volumes or revenues location differentials have increased in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices we expect natural gas and crude oil prices to remain volatile in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a we account for our derivative instruments on a marktomarket basis with changes in fair value recognized in operating revenues in the consolidated statement of operations as a result of these marktomarket adjustments associated with our derivative instruments we will likely experience volatility in our earnings due to commodity price volatility refer to impact of derivative instruments on operating revenues below and note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for more informationcommodity prices continued to decline during 2015 compared to 2014 as a result of the continued decline in commodity prices we tested the recoverability of the carrying value of all of our oil and gas properties and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 1149 million associated with certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana based on the results of our impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas 37table of contentsproperties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be requiredwe believe we are wellpositioned to manage the challenges presented in the lower commodity pricing environment and we can endure the current cyclical downturn in the oil and gas industry and the continued volatility in current and future commodity prices bycontinuing to exercise discipline in our capital program by reducing our capital expenditures and number of wells drilled compared to the prior year continuing to optimize our drilling completion and operational efficiencies resulting in lower operating costs per unit of productioncontinuing to manage our balance sheet with sufficient availability under our revolving credit facility to meet our capital requirements and maintain compliance with our debt covenantscontinuing to manage price risk by strategically hedging our natural gas and crude oil productionfinancial conditioncapital resources and liquidityour primary sources of cash in 2015 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and oil production and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital expenditures including contributions to our equity method investments interest payments on debt and payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash floweffective april 17 2015 we amended our revolving credit facility to extend the maturity date from may 2017 to april 2020 and to change the mechanism under which interest rate margins are determined for outstanding borrowings the revolving credit facility as amended provides for a borrowing base of 34 billion and commitments of 18 billion the amended credit facility also provides for an accordion feature which allows us to increase the available credit line up to an additional 500 million if one or more of the existing or new banks agree to provide such increased amount the borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of the revolving credit facility on april 1 in addition either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties due to the significant decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant in addition the amendments to our senior notes provide for potential increases in coupon rates ranging from 0 to 125 basis points depending on the asset coverage and leverage ratios at the end of the respective quarterly period in addition the amendment to our revolving credit facility increased the maximum margins we pay on borrowings under the credit facility see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the amendmentsas a result of the recent decline in commodity prices our borrowing base and related commitments under the revolving credit facility could be reduced in the future unless commodity prices continue to decline significantly from current levels we do not believe that any such reductions would have a significant impact on our ability to service our debt and fund our drilling program and related operations we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our revolving credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow and availability under our revolving credit facility we have the capacity to finance our spending plansat december 31 2015 and 2014 we had 4130 million and 1400 million of borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility respectively as of december 31 2015 we had unused commitments of 14 billion under our revolving credit facilitywe were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants as amended for both the revolving credit facility and senior notes as of december 31 2015 see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our debt38table of contentscash flowsour cash

activities operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including demand for natural gas and crude oil pipeline infrastructure constraints and seasonal influences in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital spending our working capital is substantially influenced by the variables discussed above and fluctuates based on the timing and amount of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility the timing of cash collections and payments on our trade accounts receivable and payable respectively and changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative activity from time to time our working capital will reflect a deficit while at other times it will reflect a surplus this fluctuation is not unusual at december 31 2015 and 2014 we had working capital deficits of 908 million and 856 million respectively we believe we have adequate availability under our revolving credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirementsnet cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by 4957 million when compared to 2014 this decrease was primarily due to lower operating revenues and higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses partially offset by favorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the decrease in operating revenues was primarily due to a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices partially offset by an increase in equivalent production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 34 and 48 respectively for 2015 compared to 2014 equivalent production volumes increased by 13 for 2015 over 2014 as a result of higher natural gas production in the marcellus shale and higher oil production in the eagle ford shale net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 increased by 2119 million over 2013 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and an increase in working capital the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 29 for 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of higher natural gas in the marcellus shale and oil production in the eagle ford shale average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 8 and 12 respectively for 2014 compared to 2013see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense fluctuations we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities investing activities cash flows used in investing activities decreased by 6715 million from 2014 to 2015 due to a decrease of 5240 million in capital expenditures 1984 million lower acquisition costs and a 90 million decrease in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments these decreases were partially offset by a 318 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets and 281 million of changes in restricted cash balances cash flows used in investing activities increased by 7466 million from 2013 to 2014 due to an increase of 2849 million in capital expenditures a decrease of 2840 million in proceeds from the sale of assets a 2147 million increase in acquisition expenditures related to the acquisitions of eagle ford shale assets that closed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and a 192 million increase in capital contributions associated with our equity method investments partially offsetting the increases was a 562 million decrease in restricted cash related to the release of funds by our qualified intermediary due to a lapse in the statutory holding period and the funding of oil and gas lease acquisitions during 2014 associated with likekind exchange transactions pursuant to section 1031 of the internal revenue code financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities decreased by 1938 million from 2014 to 2015 due to 3320 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 22 million related to the amendment of our credit facility in april 2015 these decreases were partially offset by lower treasury stock repurchases 39table of contentsof 1389 million as no shares were repurchased in 2015 and a decrease of 14 million in tax benefits associated with our stockbased compensation cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 5396 million from 2013 to 2014 due to 5450 million of higher net borrowings and a decrease in share repurchases of 258 million partially offset by a decrease of 203

through the april 2020 maturity date and that our senior notes will remain outstanding through their respective maturity dates a constant interest rate of 25 was assumed for the interest payments on

investment contribution commitments see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsamounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2015 was 1456 million see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detailswe have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligationspotential impact of our critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the related disclosures of assets and liabilities the following accounting policies are our most critical policies requiring more significant judgments and estimates we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis actual results could differ from those estimates successful efforts method of accountingwe follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred judgment is required to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of costs incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized 41table of contentsoil and gas reservesthe process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations and judgment of available geological geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and crude oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves and can change substantially over time periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of reservoir performance drilling activity commodity prices fluctuations in operating expenses technological advances new geological or geophysical data or other economic factors accordingly reserve estimates are generally different from the quantities ultimately recovered we cannot predict the amounts or timing of such future revisionsour reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8our rate of recording depreciation depletion and amortization ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 004 per mcfe and an increase of 005 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 005 per mcfe and an increase of 006 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa ratein addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future based on the results of our impairment test of all of our oil and gas properties and the resulting impairment charge of approximately 1149 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 we do not believe that further impairment of our oil and gas properties is reasonably likely to occur in the near future however in the event that commodity prices significantly decline from current levels additional impairments of our oil and gas properties may be requiredcarrying value of oil and gas propertieswe evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices significantly decline management would test the recoverability of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties and if necessary record an impairment charge fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life 42table of contentsdecreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 105 million or decrease by approximately 80 million respectively per yearas these properties are developed and reserves are proved the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development programasset retirement obligationsthe majority of our asset retirement obligations aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expenseaccounting for derivative instruments and hedging activitiesunder applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges and the ineffective portion of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and are recorded as a component of operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments in the consolidated statement of operations the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that are effective are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banksour financial condition results of operations and liquidity can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments due to volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices both nymex and basis differentials income taxeswe make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes these estimates and judgments include the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes and estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that we have taken we account for the uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertaintieswe believe all of our deferred tax assets net of any valuation allowances will ultimately be realized taking into consideration our forecasted future taxable income which includes consideration of future operating conditions specifically related to commodity prices if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets our tax provision could increase in the period it is determined that it is more likely than not it will not be realizedour effective tax rate is subject to variability as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates andor changes in tax laws which could affect us our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property payroll and revenues among states in which we operate a small change in our estimated future tax rate could have a material effect on current period earnings 43table of contentscontingency reservesa provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost is estimable the establishment of a reserve is based on an estimation process that includes the advice of legal counsel and subjective judgment of management in certain cases managements judgment is based on the advice and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors the interpretation of laws and regulations which can be interpreted differently by regulators and courts of laws our experience and the experiences of other companies dealing with similar matters and our decision on how we intend to respond to a particular matter actual losses can differ from estimates for various reasons including those noted above we monitor known and potential legal environmental and other contingencies and make our best estimate based on the information we have future changes in facts and circumstances not currently foreseeable could result in the actual liability exceeding the estimated ranges of loss and amounts accrued stockbased compensationwe account for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model as determined by the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensationrecently adopted accounting pronouncements in november 2015 the financial accounting standards board

regulationsrestrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments due to the significant decrease in oil and natural gas prices during 2015 and the related impact on certain of our financial covenants effective december 31 2015 we amended the agreements governing our senior notes and revolving credit facility to adjust certain financial covenants and to include an additional financial covenant among other requirements our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of consolidated cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 a minimum asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves before income taxes plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 125 to 10 which increases back to the preamended ratio of 175 to 10 beginning on january 1 2018 and a leverage ratio of debt to consolidated ebitdax of 475 to 10 through and including december 31 2016 under the terms of the respective agreements the leverage ratio will be adjusted to 425 to 10 through and including december 31 2017 and 35 to 10 beginning on march 31 2018 or until we maintain a leverage ratio below 30 to 10 for two consecutive fiscal quarters on or after december 31 2017 or we receive an investment grade rating by standard amp poors ratings services sampp or moodys investor service inc moodys at which time we will no longer be subject to this covenant our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2015 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both our senior note agreements and our revolving credit agreement operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience the areas in which we operate and market conditionscommodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil further declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our oil and gas properties or a violation of certain financial debt covenants because our reserves are predominantly natural gas approximately 96 of equivalent proved reserves changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results than oil pricesthe majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline furthermore we have experienced widening basis differentials in certain regions such as in the appalachian region resulting in further declines in natural gas prices therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is determined by certain factors that are beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on a portion of our anticipated production with the use of commodity derivatives most recently we have used commodity derivatives such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditionsresults of operations2015 and 2014 comparedwe reported a net loss for 2015 of 1139 million or 028 per share compared to net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share the decrease in net income was primarily due to lower operating revenues higher operating and interest expenses and a decrease in gain on sale of assets these decreases were partially offset by lower impairments on oil and gas properties 45table of

are as followsdirect operations decreased 47 million largely due to cost reductions from suppliers improved operational efficiencies and lower workover and plugging and abandonment expenses in 2015 compared to 2014 these decreases were partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the south texas assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 transportation and gathering increased 783 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher marcellus shale production higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements throughout 2014brokered natural gas decreased 174 million from 2014 to 2015 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas for further analysistaxes other than income decreased 42 million due to 59 million lower production taxes resulting from lower crude oil and condensate revenues and 08 million lower drilling impact fees due to a decrease in our marcellus shale drilling activities these decreases were partially offset by 20 million higher ad valorem taxes due to increased activity and the assets acquired in the fourth quarter of 2014 in south texas and 06 million higher franchise taxesexploration decreased 13 million as a result of lower exploratory dry hole costs of 45 million and 24 million lower geophysical and geological and other exploration expenses due to reduced activity these decreases were partially offset by a 51 million charge related to the release of certain drilling rig contracts in south texas in the first half of 2015 depreciation depletion and amortization decreased 105 million of which 1173 million was due to a lower ddampa rate of 093 per mcfe for 2015 compared to 113 per mcfe for 2014 partially offset by 799 million due to higher equivalent production volumes the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost reserve additions associated with our marcellus shale drilling program and the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 associated with higher ddampa rate fields in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 240 million as a result of ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and the acquisition of undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in late 2014 accretion expense increased 18 million due to the acquisition of proved properties in south texas in late 2014 and an increase in asset retirement obligations as a result of revisions of previous estimates recorded in fourth quarter 2014 48table of contentsimpairment of oil and gas properties was 1149 million in 2015 due to the impairment of certain noncore fields in south texas east texas and louisiana the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2015 in 2014 we recognized an impairment of oil and gas properties of 7710 million related to certain noncore fields primarily in east texas the impairment of these fields was due to a significant decline in commodity prices in late 2014 and managements decision not to pursue activity in these noncore areas in the then current price environments general and administrative decreased 131 million due to lower stockbased compensation expense of 78 million primarily due to a decline in the companys stock price during 2015 compared to 2014 and 18 million lower incentive compensation expense the remaining increase and decreases in other expenses were not individually significant earnings loss on equity method investments the increase in equity method earnings loss is the result of our proportionate share of net earnings from our equity method investments in 2015 compared to 2014 gain loss on sale of assets during 2015 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 39 million primarily due to the sale of certain unproved oil and gas properties in east texas during 2014 we recognized a net aggregate gain of 171 million primarily due to the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties in east texasinterest expense interest expense increased 231 million due to 241 million of higher interest expense associated with our private placement in september 2014 of 925 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes with a weightedaverage interest rate of 365 and higher commitment fees on the unused portion of our revolving credit facility of 10 million these increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of 17 million associated with our revolving credit facility due to a decrease in weightedaverage borrowings based on daily balances of approximately 3472 million compared to approximately 4100 million during 2015 and 2014 respectively income tax expense benefit income tax benefit increased 13 million due to lower pretax income partially offset by a higher effective tax rate the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 were 392 and 2224 respectively the overall effective tax rate for 2014 was significantly lower due to a change in our effective state income tax rates based on updated state apportionment factors in states in which we operate the 2014 decrease in our state apportionment factors was primarily driven by a shift in the sourcing of revenues based on the location of customers to whom we ultimately sell our natural gas in the northeast united states the 2014 decrease in effective state income tax rates significantly affected our estimated net state deferred tax liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately 870 million that was reflected in our provision for income taxes in 2014 we expect our 2016 effective income tax rate to be approximately 370 however this rate may fluctuate based on a number of factors including but not limited to changes in enacted federal andor state tax rates that occur during the year as well as changes in the composition and location of our asset base our employees and our customers2014 and 2013 comparedwe reported net income for 2014 of 1045 million or 025 per share compared to net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share the decrease in net income was due to higher operating expenses partially offset by an increase
