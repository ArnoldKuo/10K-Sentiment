policiesbasis of presentation and nature of operationscabot oil amp gas corporation and its subsidiaries the company are engaged in the development exploitation exploration production and marketing of natural gas oil and to a lesser extent ngls exclusively within the continental united states the company also transports stores gathers and purchases natural gas for resale the companys exploration and development activities are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programsthe company operates in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation and exploration the companys oil and gas properties are managed as a whole rather than through discrete operating segments or business units operational information is tracked by geographic area however financial performance is assessed as a single enterprise and not on a geographic basis allocation of resources is made on a project basis across the companys entire portfolio without regard to geographic areasthe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform with current year presentation these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income losssignificant accounting policiescash and cash equivalentsthe company considers all highly liquid shortterm investments with a maturity of three months or less and deposits in money market funds that are readily convertible to cash to be cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents were primarily concentrated in one financial institution at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company periodically assesses the financial condition of its financial institutions and considers any possible credit risk to be minimalallowance for doubtful accountsthe company records an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that the company determines to be uncollectible based on the specific identification methodinventoriesinventories are comprised of natural gas in storage tubular goods and well equipment and pipeline imbalances natural gas in storage and tubular goods and well equipment balances are carried at average costnatural gas gathering and pipeline operations normally include imbalance arrangements with the pipeline the volumes of natural gas due to or from the company under imbalance arrangements are recorded at actual selling or purchase prices as the case may be and are adjusted monthly to market pricesequity method investmentsthe company accounts for its investments in entities over which the company has significant influence but not control using the equity method of accounting under the equity method of accounting the company increases its investment for contributions made and records its proportionate share of net earnings declared dividends and partnership distributions based on the most recently available financial statements of the investee the company records the activity for its equity method investments on a one month lag in addition the company evaluates its equity method investments for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that there is an otherthantemporary decline in the value of the investment62table of contentsproperties and equipment the company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs are expensed development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalizedexploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves the determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical and engineering data if a well is determined to be successful the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well if a well is determined to be unsuccessful the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the consolidated statement of operations in the period the determination is made if an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether reserves have been found only as long as i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future if drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expensedevelopment costs of proved oil and gas properties including estimated dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the unitsofproduction method using proved developed and proved reserves respectively properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years buildings are depreciated on a straightline basis over 25 to 40 years certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over 3 to 10 yearscosts of retired sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base partial field are charged to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization if the unitsofproduction rate is not significantly affected a gain or loss if any is recognized only when a group of proved properties entire field that make up the amortization base has been retired abandoned or soldthe company evaluates its proved oil and gas properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable the company compares expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and oilunproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights during 2015 2014 and 2013 amortization associated with the companys unproved properties was 414 million 174 million and 536 million respectively and is included in depreciation depletion and amortization in the consolidated statement of operationsasset retirement obligationsthe company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset the asset retirement costs are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells however liabilities are also recorded for meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors at december 31 2015 there were no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations63table of contentsadditional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred accretion expense is included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operationsderivative instruments and hedging activities the company enters into derivative contracts primarily options and swaps to manage its exposure to price fluctuations on a portion of its anticipated future natural gas and oil production the companys credit agreement restricts the ability of the company to enter into commodity derivatives other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which the company has actual or projected exposure or as permitted under the companys risk management policies and where such derivatives do not subject the company to material speculative risks all of the companys derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposesall derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value at the end of each quarterly period these derivatives are markedtomarket if the derivative does not qualify or is not designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in income if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge changes in the fair value of the derivative are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income to the extent the hedge is effectivefor derivatives that qualify and are designated as a cash flow hedges the hedging relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis the company measures hedge effectiveness on a quarterly basis hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively if and when a hedging instrument becomes ineffective gains and losses deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges that become ineffective remain unchanged until the related production occurs if the company determines that it is probable that a forecasted hedged transaction will not occur deferred gains or losses on the related hedging instrument are recognized in income immediatelygains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are included in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues gains and losses on derivatives which represent hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on derivatives not designated or that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in operating revenues in gain loss on derivative instruments the resulting cash flows are reported as cash flows from operating activitiesfair value of assets and liabilities the company follows the authoritative accounting guidance for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities in its financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as followslevel 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active marketslevel 2 quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liabilitylevel 3 significant unobservable inputs for use when little or no market data exists requiring a significant degree of judgmentthe hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in the valuation should be chosenrevenue recognition natural gas and oil sales result from interests in oil and gas properties owned by the company sales of natural gas and oil are recognized when the product is delivered and title transfers to the purchaser payment is generally received one to three months after the sale has occurred64table of contentsproducer gas imbalances the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances under this method a natural gas imbalance liability is recorded if the companys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties at the actual price realized upon the gas sale a receivable is recognized only to the extent an imbalance cannot be recouped from the reserves in the underlying properties the companys aggregate imbalance positions at december 31 2015 and 2014 were not materialbrokered natural gas revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company buys and sells natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions typically with separate counterparties whereby the company andor the counterparty takes title to the natural gas purchased or soldincome taxes the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realizedthe company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertaintiesthe company recognizes accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions in interest expense and accrued penalties related to such positions in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operationsstockbased compensationthe company accounts for stockbased compensation under the fair value method of accounting under this method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value the company uses either a monte carlo or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operationsthe tax benefit for stockbased compensation is included as both a cash outflow from operating activities and a cash inflow from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the companys income taxes payableenvironmental mattersenvironmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when receivedcredit and concentration risksubstantially all of the companys accounts receivable result from the sale of natural gas and oil and joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and gas industry this concentration of purchasers and joint interest owners may impact the companys overall credit risk either positively or negatively in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions the company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to nonperformance by the third parties65table of contentsduring the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 two customers accounted for approximately 16 and 14 two customers accounted for approximately 14 and 10 and four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 respectively of the companys total sales the company does not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect because alternative customers are readily availableuse of estimatesin preparing financial statements the company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the united states these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period the most significant estimates pertain to proved natural gas and oil reserves and related cash flow estimates which are used to compute depreciation depletion and amortization and impairments of proved oil and gas properties other significant estimates include natural gas and oil revenues and expenses fair value of derivative instruments estimates of expenses related to legal environmental and other contingencies asset retirement obligations postretirement obligations stockbased compensation and deferred income taxes actual results could differ from those estimatesrecently adopted accounting pronouncementsin november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201517 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes the amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is allowed this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented the company elected to early adopt this standard on a prospective basis and as a result there have been no adjustments made to prior periods the adoption of this guidance only affected the companys financial position and did not have an impact on its results of operations or cash flowsrecently issued accounting pronouncements in march 2015 the fasb issued asu no 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs the amendments in this update require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct

the plan adopted by the companys board of directors is intended to provide a compensation tool tied to stock market value creation to serve as an incentive and retention vehicle for fulltime nonofficer employees by providing for cash payments in the event the companys common stock reaches a specified trading price the compensation committee can increase any of the payments as applied to any employee if desired any deferred portion will only be paid if the participant is employed by the company or has terminated employment by reason of retirement death or disability as provided in the plan payments are subject to certain other restrictions contained in the planthe plan currently provides for a payout if the closing price per share of the companys common stock for any 20 trading days out of any 60 days consecutive trading days equals or exceeds an interim price goal per share within two years of the effective date of the plan interim trigger date or a final price goal per share within four years of the effective date of the plan final trigger date under the plan and upon approval by the compensation committee each eligible employee may receive a distribution of 20 of base salary if the interim trigger is met or 50 of base salary if the final trigger is met or an incremental 30 of base salary if the interim trigger was previously achieved in accordance with the plan in the event either the interim or final trigger date occurs within the first 30 months from the effective date 25 of the total distribution will be paid immediately and the remaining 75 will be deferred and paid at a future date as described in the plan for final trigger dates occurring during the last 18 months but before the end of the plan total distribution will be paid immediately the plan is accounted for as a liability award under the authoritative accounting guidance for stockbased compensation and is valued as of the end of each reporting period on a marktomarket basis using a monte carlo simulation model in addition to the expected value of plan payouts the simulation technique also generates an expected trigger date for the two types of payments made under this plan which is used to determine the requisite service period the company recognized compensation expense benefit of 03 million 30 million and 115 million for years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013

corporationsupplemental oil and gas information unauditedoil and gas reservesusers of this information should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosuresestimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 were based on studies performed by the companys petroleum engineering staff the estimates were computed using the 12month average index price for the respective commodity calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of
