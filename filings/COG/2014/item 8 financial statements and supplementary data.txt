incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities which become part of the cost of oil and gas produced   proved properties properties with proved reserves   proved reserves proved reserves are those quantities which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions and operating methods prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods  4      table of contents are used for the estimation the project to extract hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time   existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined the price shall be the average price during the twelvemonth period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions   recompletion an operation whereby a completion in one zone is abandoned in order to attempt a completion in a different zone within the existing wellbore   reliable technology a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonable certain

there will exist the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project   reservoir a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil andor gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs   resources resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations a portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations   royalty interest an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to receive a portion of the production from the leased acreage or of the proceeds of the sale thereof but generally does not require the owner to pay any portion of the costs of drilling or operating the wells on the leased acreage royalties may be either landowners royalties which are reserved by the owner of the leased acreage at the time the lease is granted or overriding royalties which are usually reserved by an owner of the leasehold in connection with a transfer to a subsequent owner   shale finegrained sedimentary rock composed mostly of consolidated clay or mud   standardized measure the present value discounted at 10 per year of estimated future net revenues from the production of proved reserves computed by applying sales prices used in estimating proved oil and gas reserves to the yearend quantities of those reserves in effect as of the dates of such estimates and held constant throughout the productive life of the reserves except for consideration of future price changes to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at yearend and deducting the estimated future costs to be incurred in developing producing and abandoning the proved reserves computed based on yearend costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions future income taxes are calculated by applying the appropriate yearend statutory federal and state income tax rate with consideration of future tax rates already legislated to pretax future net cash flows net of the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to proved oil and gas reserves  5      table of contents  unconventional play a term used in the oil and gas industry to refer to a play in which the targeted reservoirs generally fall into one of three categories 1 tight sands 2 coal beds or 3 shales the reservoirs tend to cover large areas and lack the readily apparent traps seals and discrete hydrocarbonwater boundaries that typically define conventional reservoirs these reservoirs generally require fracture stimulation treatments or other special recovery processes in order to achieve economic flow rates   undeveloped reserves undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty   unproved properties properties with no proved reserves   working interest an interest in an oil and gas lease that gives the owner of the interest the right to drill for and produce oil and gas on the leased acreage and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations  6                 table of contents       part i    items 1 and 2 business and properties   cabot oil amp gas corporation is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the development exploitation and exploration of oil and gas properties our assets are concentrated in areas with known hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs we operate in one segment natural gas and oil development exploitation exploration and production in the continental united states we have regional offices located in houston texas and pittsburgh pennsylvania   strategy   our objective is to enhance shareholder value over the longterm through consistent growth in cash flows earnings production and reserves we believe this is attainable through a combination of disciplined management and our core asset base that offers a strategic advantage for continued growth key components of our business strategy include   disciplined capital spending focused on highreturn organic projects we allocate our capital program based on projects that we expect will enable us to maximize our production and reserve growth at attractive returns our capital program is based on the expectation of being fully funded through operating cash flows while we consider various growth opportunities including strategic acquisitions our primary focus is organic growth through drilling our core areas of operation where we believe we can exploit our extensive inventory of lowcost highreturn repeatable drilling opportunities   low cost structure our operations are focused on select unconventional plays with significant resource potential that allow us to add and produce reserves at a low cost we have developed sizable contiguous acreage positions in these core operating areas and believe the concentration of our assets allows us to further reduce costs through economies of scale we continue to optimize drilling and completion efficiencies through the use of multiwell pad drilling in our core operating areas resulting in additional cost savings furthermore since we operate in a limited number of geographic areas we believe we can leverage our technical expertise in these areas to achieve further cost reductions through operational efficiencies we also operate a majority of our properties which allows us to more effectively manage all elements of our cost structure   conservative financial position and financial flexibility we believe the prudent management of our balance sheet and the active management of commodity price risk allows us the financial flexibility to continue to provide consistent production and reserve growth over time even in periods of depressed commodity prices we utilize derivative contracts to manage commodity price risk and to provide a level of cash flow predictability in the event we experience a lower than anticipated commodity price environment we believe that we have the flexibility to supplement the funding of our capital program with select asset sales joint ventures and borrowings under our credit facility   continued portfolio management we will continue to evaluate and manage our properties that no longer fit in our current portfolio through the execution of strategic asset sales or other similar arrangements we expect to utilize the proceeds generated from these activities for reinvestment into higherreturn projects in our core operating areas potential share repurchases or new growth initiatives   expand our unconventional resource initiatives we will continue to evaluate opportunities that generate value and contribute to our growth initiatives including new exploration concepts and ideas that if successful can match the size scope and rate of returns of our existing core assets we will also consider the use of joint venture arrangements to achieve these objectives  7      table of contents  2014 outlook   in 2014 we plan to spend between approximately 13 billion and 14 billion on capital and exploration activities we plan to drill approximately 155 to 175 gross wells or 150 to 170 net focusing our capital program in the marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we expect to allocate approximately 73 of our 2014 capital program to the marcellus shale approximately 25 to our oilfocused play in the eagle ford shale and the remaining 2 to other emerging plays and nondrilling expenditures incremental to our capital and exploration expenditures program we also expect to contribute approximately 364 million to constitution pipeline company llc constitution to fund costs associated with the development and construction of a natural gas pipeline in northeast pennsylvania see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding our investment in constitution   description of properties   our exploration development and production operations are primarily concentrated in two unconventional playsthe marcellus shale in northeast pennsylvania and the eagle ford shale in south texas we also have operations in various other unconventional and conventional plays throughout the continental united states   marcellus shale   our marcellus shale properties represent our largest operating and growth area in terms of reserves production and capital investment our properties are principally located in susquehanna county and to a lesser extent bradford and wyoming counties pennsylvania we currently hold approximately 200000 net acres in the dry gas window of the play our 2013 net production in the marcellus shale was 3565 bcfe representing approximately 86 of our total equivalent production for the year as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 3546 net wells in the marcellus shale the majority of which are operated by us   during 2013 we invested 8158 million in the marcellus shale and drilled 945 net horizontal wells and completed and turned in line 960 net wells as of december 31 2013 we had 300 net wells that were either in the completion stage or waiting on completion or connection to a pipeline we exited 2013 with six drilling rigs operating in the play   eagle ford shale   our properties in the eagle ford shale are principally located in atascosa frio la salle and zavala counties texas where we hold over 60000 net acres in the oil window of the play in 2013 our net crude oilcondensatengl and natural gas production from the eagle ford was 2164 mbbl and 12 bcf respectively or 142 bcfe representing approximately 3 of our full year equivalent production as of december 31 2013 we had a total of 854 net wells in the eagle ford   during 2013 we invested 2615 million in the eagle ford and drilled or participated in drilling 332 net wells we exited 2013 with two drilling rigs operating in the play   other oil and gas properties   in addition to our core unconventional resource plays we also operate or participate in other conventional and unconventional plays throughout the continental united states including the utica shale in pennsylvania the pearsall shale in south texas the cotton valley haynesville bossier and james lime formations in east texas the devonian shale big lime weir and berea in west virginia and the frio vicksburg and wilcox formations in south texas  8      table of contents  in 2013 we invested 190 million in the pearsall shale and drilled a total of 111 net wells under a joint development agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of osaka gas co ltd osaka that was entered into in june 2012 under the joint development agreement osaka agreed to fund 85 of our share of drilling and completion costs associated with these leaseholds the drilling and completion carry of 1250 million was fully satisfied in fourth quarter 2013   other properties   ancillary to our exploration development and production operations we operate a number of gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems made up of approximately 3100 miles of pipeline with interconnects to three interstate transmission systems and five local distribution companies and numerous end users as of the end of 2013 the majority of our pipeline infrastructure is located in west virginia and is regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc for interstate transportation service and the west virginia public service commission wvpsc for intrastate transportation service as such the transportation rates and terms of service of our pipeline subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation are subject to the rules and regulations of the ferc and the wvpsc our natural gas gathering and transmission pipeline systems in west virginia enable us to connect new wells quickly and to transport natural gas from the wellhead directly to interstate pipelines local distribution companies and industrial end users control of our gathering and transmission pipeline systems also enables us to purchase transport and sell natural gas produced by third parties in addition we can engage in development drilling without relying upon third parties to transport our natural gas and incur only the incremental costs of pipeline and compressor additions to our system   we also have two natural gas storage fields located in west virginia with a combined working capacity of approximately 4 bcf we use these storage fields to take advantage of the seasonal variations in the demand for natural gas typically associated with winter natural gas sales while maintaining production at a nearly constant rate throughout the year the pipeline systems and storage fields are fully integrated with our operations in west virginia   divestitures   in december 2013 we sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles to chaparral energy llc for approximately 1600 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized a 194 million gain on sale of assets we also sold certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas to a third party for approximately 1234 million subject to post closing adjustments and recognized a 175 million loss on sale of assets   in 2013 we sold various other proved and unproved properties for approximately 443 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 195 million   in december 2012 we sold certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas to a private company for 299 million and recognized an 182 million loss on sale of assets   in june 2012 we sold a 35 nonoperated working interest associated with certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas to a whollyowned subsidiary of osaka for

sale of assets  9      table of contents  in may 2011 we sold certain of our unproved haynesville and bossier shale oil and gas properties in east texas to a third party for approximately 470 million and recognized a 342 million gain on sale of assets   in 2011 we sold various other unproved properties and other assets for approximately 735 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 250 million   in december 2010 we sold our existing pennsylvania gathering infrastructure of approximately 75 miles of pipeline and two compressor stations to williams field services williams a subsidiary of williams partners lp for 150 million and recognized a 493 million gain on sale of assets   in 2010 we sold various other proved and unproved properties and other assets for approximately 322 million and recognized an aggregate net gain of 163 million   marketing   substantially all of our natural gas is sold at market sensitive prices under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts the principal markets for our natural gas are in the northeastern united states and the industrialized gulf coast area in the northeastern united states we sell natural gas to industrial customers local distribution companies and gas marketers both on and off our pipeline and gathering system in the gulf coast area we sell natural gas to intrastate pipelines natural gas processors and marketing companies properties in the gulf coast area are connected to various processing plants in texas and louisiana with multiple interstate and intrastate deliveries affording us access to multiple markets   we also incur transportation and gathering expenses to move our natural gas production from the wellhead to our principal markets in the united states the majority of our natural gas production is transported on thirdparty gathering systems and interstate pipelines where we have longterm contractual capacity arrangements or through the use of purchaserowned capacity under both longterm and shortterm sales contracts   to date we have not experienced significant difficulty in transporting or marketing our natural gas production as it becomes available however there is no assurance that we will always be able to transport and market all of our production or obtain favorable prices   in february 2014 we entered into a precedent agreement with transcontinental gas pipe line company llc transco for the construction of a new pipeline with committed takeaway capacity from our acreage position in susquehanna country pennsylvania under the terms of the precedent agreement transco will construct and operate approximately 177 miles of new pipeline from the zick area of susquehanna county to an interconnect with transcos mainline in lancaster county pennsylvania we will own 850000 mmbtu per day of firm capacity on the newly constructed pipeline and acquire a 20 equity interest in the project subject to certain terms and conditions yet to be determined and regulatory approval the expected inservice date for the new pipeline is scheduled for the second half of 2017 in february 2014 we also entered into a definitive gas sale and purchase agreement with wgl midstream inc wgl to sell 500000 mmbtu per day of natural gas to wgl for a primary term of 15 years commencing upon the inservice date of the newly constructed pipeline   risk management   from time to time we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively the collar arrangements are a combination of put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of natural gas and crude oil production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments  10      table of contents from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for the particular period under the swap agreement   during 2013 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 309 to 515 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 398 to 623 per mcf covered 2417 bcf or 61 of our natural gas production at an average price of 396 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 1095 mbbl or 38 of our crude oil production at an

risks inherent in our estimates of proved reserves see the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 and risk factorsour proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated in item 1a   technologies used in reserves estimates   we utilize several different traditional methods to estimate our crude oil and natural gas reserves including decline curve extrapolations material balance calculations volumetric calculations and analogies and in some cases a combination of these methods in addition at times we may use seismic interpretations to confirm continuity of a formation in combination with traditional technologies however the seismic interpretations are not used in the volumetric computation   internal control   our vice president engineering and technology is the technical person primarily responsible for our internal reserves estimation process and provides oversight of our corporate reservoir engineering department which consists of four professional engineers and the annual audit of our yearend reserves by our independent third party engineers he has a bachelor of science degree in chemical engineering specializing in petroleum engineering and over 31 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility in operations engineering and evaluations he has worked in the area of reserves and reservoir engineering for 22 years and is a member of the society of petroleum engineers   our reserves estimation process is coordinated by our corporate reservoir engineering department reserve information including models and other technical data are stored on secured databases on our network certain nontechnical inputs used in the reserves estimation process including commodity prices production and development costs and ownership percentages are obtained by other departments and are subject to testing as part of our annual internal control process we also engage miller and lents independent petroleum engineers to perform an independent audit of our estimated proved reserves upon completion of the process the estimated reserves are presented to senior management including the chairman president and chief executive officer and vice president chief financial officer and treasurer for approval   miller and lents made independent estimates for 100 of our proved reserves estimates and concluded in their judgment we have an effective system for gathering data and documenting information required to estimate our proved reserves and project our future revenues further miller and lents has concluded 1 the reserves estimation methods employed by us were appropriate and our classification of such reserves was appropriate to the relevant sec reserve definitions 2 our  12      table of contents

have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards individual properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty overriding royalty carried net profits working and other outstanding interests customary in the industry in addition interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens  15      table of contents such as production payments ordinary course liens incidental to operating agreements and for current taxes or development obligations under oil and gas leases as is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties often little investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties   competition   competition in our primary producing areas is intense price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times and distribution efficiencies affect competition we believe that our extensive acreage position and our access to gathering and pipeline infrastructure in pennsylvania along with our expected activity level and the related services and equipment that we have secured for the upcoming years enhance our competitive position over other producers who do not have similar systems or services in place we also actively compete against other companies with substantial financial and other resources   major customers   during the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 four customers accounted for approximately 21 16 14 and 11 and three customers accounted for approximately 18 12 and 10 respectively of our total sales during the year ended december 31 2011 we did not have any one customer account for greater than 10 of our total sales we do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on us because alternative customers are readily available   seasonality   demand for natural gas has historically been seasonal with peak demand and typically higher prices occurring during the colder winter months   regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production   exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal state and local levels this regulation includes requiring permits to drill wells maintaining bonding requirements to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells the method of drilling and casing wells the surface use and restoration of properties on which wells are drilled and the plugging and abandoning of wells our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units the density of wells that may be drilled in a given field and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases in addition state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells generally prohibiting the venting or flaring of natural gas and imposing certain requirements regarding the ratability of production the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations where we can drill because these statutes rules and regulations undergo constant review and often are amended expanded and reinterpreted we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of regulatory compliance the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases its cost of doing business and consequently affects its profitability we do not believe however we are affected differently by these regulations than others in the industry  16      table of contents  natural gas marketing gathering and transportation   federal legislation and regulatory controls have historically affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which our production is transported and marketed under the natural gas act of 1938 nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 ngpa and the regulations promulgated under those statutes the ferc regulates the interstate sale for resale of natural gas and the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce although facilities used in the production or gathering of natural gas in interstate commerce are generally exempted from ferc jurisdiction effective beginning in january 1993 the natural gas wellhead decontrol act deregulated natural gas prices for all first sales of natural gas which definition covers all sales of our own production in addition as part of the broad industry restructuring initiatives described below the ferc granted to all producers such as us a blanket certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing the sale of natural gas for resale without further ferc approvals as a result of this policy all of our produced natural gas is sold at market prices subject to the terms of any private contracts that may be in effect in addition under the provisions of the energy policy act of 2005 2005 act the nga was amended to prohibit any forms of market manipulation in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas pursuant to the 2005 act the ferc established regulations intended to increase natural gas pricing transparency by among other things requiring market participants to report their gas sales transactions annually to the ferc the 2005 act also significantly increased the penalties for violations of the nga and the fercs regulations up to 1000000 per day per violation in 2010 the ferc issued penalty guidelines for the determination of civil penalties and procedure under its enforcement program   some of our pipelines are subject to regulation by the ferc we own an intrastate natural gas pipeline through our whollyowned subsidiary cranberry pipeline corporation that provides interstate transportation and storage services pursuant to section 311 of the ngpa as well as intrastate transportation and storage services that are regulated by the west virginia public service commission for qualified intrastate pipelines ferc allows interstate transportation service on behalf of interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the intrastate pipeline to the more comprehensive nga jurisdiction of the ferc we provide section 311 service in accordance with a publicly available statement of operating conditions filed with ferc under rates that are subject to approval by the ferc on december 26 2012 we filed with the ferc a petition for rate approval of our existing interstate transportation rates and a proposed decrease of our storage rates by letter order issued may 15 2013 the ferc approved the rate petition   additionally in 2012 we executed a precedent agreement with constitution pipeline company llc at the time a wholly owned subsidiary of williams partners lp for transportation capacity and acquired a 25 equity interest in a pipeline to be constructed in the states of new york and pennsylvania on june 12 2013 the project sponsors filed an application with ferc requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to construct and operate the 120mile pipeline project that once completed will provide 650000 dth per day of pipeline capacity ferc has scheduled issuance of the projects final environmental impact statement for june 13 2014 there is no guarantee that ferc will certify the project or if they do that the project scope or timeline for construction will remain unchanged by the regulatory permitting process if placed into service the project pipeline will be an interstate pipeline subject to full regulation by ferc under the nga   our production and gathering facilities are not subject to jurisdiction of the ferc however our natural gas sales prices nevertheless continue to be affected by intrastate and interstate gas transportation regulation because the cost of transporting the natural gas once sold to the consuming market is a factor in the prices we receive beginning with order no 436 in 1985 and continuing through order no 636 in 1992 and order no 637 in 2000 the ferc has adopted a series of rulemakings that have significantly altered the transportation and marketing of natural gas these changes were intended by the ferc to foster competition by among other things requiring interstate  17      table of contents pipeline companies to separate their wholesale gas marketing business from their gas transportation business and by increasing the transparency of pricing for pipeline services the ferc has also established regulations governing the relationship of pipelines with their marketing affiliates which essentially require that designated employees function independently of each other and that certain information not be shared the ferc has also implemented standards relating to the use of electronic data exchange by the pipelines to make transportation information available on a timely basis and to enable transactions to occur on a purely electronic basis   in light of these statutory and regulatory changes most pipelines have divested their natural gas sales functions to marketing affiliates which operate separately from the transporter and in direct competition with all other merchants most pipelines have also implemented the largescale divestiture of their natural gas gathering facilities to affiliated or nonaffiliated companies interstate pipelines are required to provide unbundled open and nondiscriminatory transportation and transportationrelated services to producers gas marketing companies local distribution companies industrial end users and other customers seeking such services as a result of ferc requiring natural gas pipeline companies to separate marketing and transportation services sellers and buyers of natural gas have gained direct access to pipeline transportation services and are better able to conduct business with a larger number of counterparties we believe these changes generally have improved our access to markets while at the same time substantially increasing competition in the natural gas marketplace we cannot predict what new or different regulations the ferc and other regulatory agencies may adopt or what effect subsequent regulations may have on our activities similarly we cannot predict what proposals if any that affect the oil and natural gas industry might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures and what effect if any such proposals might have on us further we cannot predict whether the recent trend toward federal deregulation of the natural gas industry will continue or what effect future policies will have on our sale of gas   we use derivative financial instruments such as collar and swap agreements to attempt to more effectively manage price risk due to the impact of changes in commodity prices on our operating results and cash flows following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank act in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions including certain options the cftc regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties in addition all swap market participants are subject to new reporting and recordkeeping requirements related to their swap transactions we believe that our use of swaps to hedge against commodity exposure qualifies us as an enduser exempting us from the requirement to centrally clear our swaps nevertheless the changes to the swap market as a result of doddfrank implementation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable   federal regulation of petroleum   our sales of crude oil and ngls are not regulated and are made at market prices however the price received from the sale of these products is affected by the cost of transporting the products to market much of that transportation is through interstate common carrier pipelines which are regulated by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica ferc requires that pipelines regulated under the ica file tariffs setting forth the rates and terms and conditions of service and that such service not be unduly discriminatory or preferential   effective january 1 1995 the ferc implemented regulations generally grandfathering all previously approved interstate transportation rates and establishing an indexing system for those rates  18      table of contents by which annual adjustments are made annually based on the rate of inflation subject to certain conditions and limitations these regulations may increase or decrease the cost of transporting crude oil and ngls by interstate pipeline although the annual adjustments may result in decreased rates in a given year every five years the ferc must examine the relationship between the annual change in the applicable index and the actual cost changes experienced in the oil pipeline industry in december 2010 to implement this required fiveyear redetermination the ferc established an upward adjustment in the index to track oil pipeline cost changes and determined that the producer price index for finished goods plus 265 should be the oil pricing index for the fiveyear period beginning july 1 2011 the result of indexing is a ceiling rate for each rate which is the maximum at which the pipeline may set its interstate transportation rates a pipeline may also file costofservice based rates if rate indexing will be insufficient to allow the pipeline to recover its costs rates are subject to challenge by protest when they are filed or changed for indexed rates complaints alleging that the rates are unjust and unreasonable may only be pursued if the complainant can show that a substantial change has occurred since the enactment of energy policy act of 1992 in either the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services provided that were a basis for the rate there is no such limitation on complaints alleging that the pipelines rates or terms and conditions of service are unduly discriminatory or preferential we are unable to predict with certainty the effect upon us of these periodic reviews by the ferc of the pipeline index   pipeline safety regulation   certain of our pipeline systems and storage fields in west virginia are regulated for safety compliance by the us department of transportation dot and the west virginia public service commission in 2002 congress enacted the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act which contains a number of provisions intended to increase pipeline operating safety the dots final regulations implementing the act became effective february 2004 among other provisions the regulations require that pipeline operators implement a pipeline integrity management program that must at a minimum include an inspection of gas transmission and nonrural gathering pipeline facilities in certain locations within ten years and at least every seven years thereafter on march 15 2006 the dot revised these regulations to define more clearly the categories of gathering facilities subject to dot regulation establish new safety rules for certain gathering lines in rural areas revise the current regulations applicable to safety and inspection of gathering lines in nonrural areas and adopt new compliance deadlines the initial baseline assessments under our integrity management program for our pipeline system in west virginia were completed in january 2013 pipeline integrity was confirmed at each of the targeted assessment sites a new sevenyear reassessment cycle began during 2013   in december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 pipes act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act proposed enhancements for state programs to reduce excavation damage to pipelines established increased federal enforcement of onecall excavation programs and established a new program for review of pipeline security plans and critical facility inspections pursuant to the pipes act the dot issued regulations on may 5 2011 that would with limited exceptions subject all lowstress hazardous liquids pipelines regardless of location or size to the dots pipeline safety regulations   in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 the act increased the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions required the dot to issue regulations requiring the use of automatic or remotecontrolled shutoff valves on new and rebuilt pipelines and to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety and the use of leak detection systems by hazardous liquid pipelines required pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposed new emergency response and incident notification requirements the act reflects many of the areas of possible  19      table of contents regulatory change described in an advance notice of proposed rulemaking issued by the dot on august 18 2011 aside from rules contained in the act which include revisions to dots civil penalty authority and the requirement that pipelines verify maximum allowable operating pressure the dot has not yet promulgated any new regulations required by the act   on december 3 2009 the dot adopted a regulation requiring gas and hazardous liquid pipelines that use supervisory control and data acquisition scada systems and have at least one controller and control room to develop written control room management procedures by august 1 2011 and implement the procedures by february 1 2013 the dot expedited the program implementation deadline to october 1 2011 for most of the requirements except for certain provisions regarding adequate information and alarm management which had a program implementation deadline of august 1 2012 we developed and implemented the required control room management procedures in accordance with the deadlines effective january 1 2011 natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines also became subject to updated reporting requirements with dot   the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules depends on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas can have a significant impact on costs we may incur to ensure compliance in the future other laws and regulations may be enacted or adopted or existing laws may be reinterpreted in a manner that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties for failure to comply with pipeline regulations   environmental and safety regulations   general our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment permits are required for the operation of our various facilities these permits can be revoked modified or renewed by issuing authorities governmental authorities enforce compliance with their regulations through fines injunctions or both government regulations can increase the cost of planning designing installing and operating and can affect the timing of installing and operating oil and natural gas facilities although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are part of oil and natural gas production operations no assurance can be given that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred also it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and natural gas production could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us   us laws and regulations applicable to our operations include those controlling the discharge of materials into the environment requiring removal and cleanup of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment   solid and hazardous waste we currently own or lease and have in the past owned or leased numerous properties that were used for the production of oil and natural gas for many years although operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time may have been utilized it is possible that hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties currently owned or leased by us state and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have become stricter over time under these increasingly stringent requirements we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed or released by prior owners and operators or clean up property contamination including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators or to perform plugging operations to prevent future contamination  20                 table of contents   we generate some hazardous wastes that are already subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes the environmental protection agency epa has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes it is possible that certain wastes currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes under rcra or other applicable statutes we could therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements in the future than we encounter today   superfund the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla also known as the superfund law and comparable state laws and regulations impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain persons with respect to the release of hazardous substances into the environment these persons include the current and past owners and operators of a site where the release occurred and any party that treated or disposed of or arranged for the treatment or disposal of hazardous substances found at a site under cercla such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies cercla also authorizes the epa and in some cases private parties to undertake actions to clean up such hazardous substances or to recover the costs of such actions from the responsible parties in addition it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment in the course of business we have used materials and generated wastes and will continue to use materials and generate wastes that may fall within cerclas definition of hazardous substances we may also be an owner or operator of sites on which hazardous substances have been released as a result we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up sites where such substances have been released   oil pollution act the federal oil pollution act of 1990 opa and resulting regulations impose a variety of obligations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in waters of the united states the term waters of the united states has been broadly defined to include inland water bodies including wetlands and intermittent streams the opa assigns joint and several strict liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages the opa also imposes ongoing requirements on operators including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill we believe that we substantially comply with the oil pollution act and related federal regulations   endangered species act the endangered species act esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats while some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the esa nor are we aware of any proposed listings that will affect our operations however the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states   clean water act the federal water pollution control act clean water act and resulting regulations which are primarily implemented through a system of permits also govern the discharge of certain contaminants into waters of the united states sanctions for failure to comply strictly with the clean water act are generally resolved by payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies however regulatory agencies could require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to cease hauling wastewaters to facilities owned by others that are the source of water discharges we believe that we substantially comply with the clean water act and related federal and state regulations  21      table of contents  clean air act our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable local and state laws and regulations to control emissions from sources of air pollution federal and state laws require new and modified sources of air pollutants to obtain permits prior to commencing construction major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent federally imposed requirements including additional permits federal and state laws designed to control toxic air pollutants might require installation of additional controls payment of fines and correction of any identified deficiencies generally resolve penalties for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits regulatory agencies could also require us to cease construction or operation of certain facilities or to install additional controls on certain facilities that are air emission sources we believe that we substantially comply with the emission standards under local state and federal laws and regulations   safe drinking water act the safe drinking water act sdwa and comparable local and state provisions restrict the disposal treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development subsurface emplacement of fluids including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that in some cases includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the states environmental authority these regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities   hydraulic fracturing many of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and natural gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or natural gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well due to concerns raised relating to potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been initiated to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing or prohibit the activity altogether such efforts could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities for additional information about hydraulic fracturing and related environmental matters please read risk factorsfederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays in item 1a   greenhouse gas in response to recent studies suggesting that emissions of carbon dioxide and certain other gases may be contributing to global climate change the united states congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from sources within the united states between 2012 and 2050 in addition almost onehalf of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories andor regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs the epa has also begun to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act please read risk factorsclimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce in item 1a   osha and other laws and regulations we are subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws the osha hazard communication standard the epa community righttoknow regulations under the title iii of cercla and similar state laws require that we organize andor disclose information

our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results and could result in an impairment charge see future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results   prices for natural gas and oil are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control these factors include but are not limited to the following   the levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand including the potential longterm impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale such as that produced from our marcellus shale properties on the global natural gas supply   the level of consumer product demand   23      table of contents   weather conditions  political conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions including the middle east africa and south america  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  the price level of foreign imports  actions of governmental authorities  the availability proximity and capacity of gathering transportation processing andor refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil  inventory storage levels  the nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation including environmental and climate change regulation  the price availability and acceptance of alternative fuels  technological advances affecting energy consumption  speculation by investors in oil and natural gas  variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices and   overall economic conditions including the value of the us dollar relative to other major currencies    these factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict with any certainty the future prices of natural gas and crude oil if natural gas and crude oil prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time the lower prices may adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations   drilling natural gas and oil wells is a highrisk activity   our growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be encountered the cost of drilling completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain and drilling operations may be curtailed delayed or cancelled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control including   unexpected drilling conditions pressure or irregularities in formations   equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  decreases in natural gas and oil prices  surface access restrictions  loss of title or other title related issues  compliance with or changes in governmental requirements and regulation and   costs of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials   24      table of contents  our future drilling activities may not be successful and if unsuccessful such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activity within a particular geographic area may decline we may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame or at all we may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because in some cases we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location similarly our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget the final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors including   the results of exploration efforts and the acquisition review and analysis of the seismic data   the availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects   the approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled   economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews  our financial resources and results and  the availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits    these projects may not be successfully developed and the wells if drilled may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil   our proved reserves are estimates any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated   reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as natural gas and oil prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds furthermore different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data   results of drilling testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate accordingly initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered and such variances may be material any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves   you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves in accordance with sec requirements we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate in addition the 10 discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most  25      table of contents appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general   future natural gas and oil price declines may result in writedowns of the carrying amount of our assets which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations   the value of our assets depends on prices of natural gas and crude oil declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs changes in well performance delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding writedown of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties   we evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a propertys carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future crude natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices decline further there could be a significant revision in the future   our future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable   in general the production rate of natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce our reserves will decline eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas and oil production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations our future natural gas and oil production is therefore highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves we may not be able to replace reserves through our exploration development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs low natural gas and oil prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically   our reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of december 31 2013 will increase at an estimated rate of 05 during 2014 and then decline at estimated rates of 36 24 and 18 during 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves we consider this pattern fairly typical   exploration development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in among other things dry holes the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves   we have substantial capital requirements and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms if at all   we rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longerterm capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources future challenges in the global financial system including the capital markets may adversely affect our business and our financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire or need to raise capital which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to  26      table of contents changing economic and business conditions adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues   strategic determinations including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities are challenging and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate   our future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business in developing our business plan we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including welldevelopment primarily drilling reserve acquisitions exploratory activity corporate items and other alternatives we also considered our likely sources of capital notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2014 plan business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention including possible acquisitions and dispositions if we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected moreover economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2014 plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives   negative public perception regarding us andor our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations   negative public perception regarding us andor our industry resulting from among other things concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing oil spills and explosions of natural gas transmission lines may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny which may in turn lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws regulations guidelines and enforcement interpretations these actions may cause operational delays or restrictions increased operating costs additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation moreover governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process including through intervention in the courts negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business   our ability to sell our natural gas and oil production andor the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing   the sale of our natural gas and oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities we deliver our natural gas and oil production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own the lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shutin of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties thirdparty systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons to the extent these services are unavailable we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business   for example the marcellus shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates the amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in such event this could result  27      table of contents in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity andor natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on nymex or than we currently project which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows   we are subject to complex laws and regulations including environmental and safety regulations which can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business   our operations are subject to extensive federal state and local laws and regulations including drilling permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation storage handling emission transportation and discharge of materials into the environment these laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of doing business many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities and these permits are subject to revocation modification and renewal governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations and violations could subject us to fines injunctions or both these laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning designing drilling installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs increased scrutiny of our industry may also occur as a result of epas 20112016 national enforcement initiative assuring energy extraction activities comply with environmental laws through which epa will address incidences of noncompliance from natural gas extraction and production activities that may cause or contribute to significant harm to public health andor the environment in addition we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners of property we purchase or lease risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations for example we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders it is possible that other developments such as stricter environmental laws and regulations and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production would result in substantial costs and liabilities   acquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits as well as potential liabilities   successful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control these factors include estimates of recoverable reserves exploration potential future natural gas and oil prices operating costs production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities these assessments are complex and inherently imprecise our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems in addition our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties we do not inspect every well and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural subsurface or environmental problems that may exist or arise   there may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental title regulatory tax contract litigation or other matters of which we are unaware which could materially and adversely affect our production revenues and results of operations we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities including environmental liabilities and our contractual indemnification may not be effective at times we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties in addition significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties  28                 table of contents   the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention away from our existing operations   the integration of the properties we acquire could be difficult and may divert managements attention and financial resources away from our existing operations these difficulties include   the challenge of integrating the acquired properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business   the inability to retain key employees of the acquired business  potential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties and   the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations    the process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activities of our business members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business if management is not able to effectively manage the integration process or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process our business could suffer   we face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses   our business involves a variety of operating risks including   well site blowouts cratering and explosions  equipment failures  pipe or cement failures and casing collapses which can release natural gas oil drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids  uncontrolled flows of natural gas oil or well fluids  pipeline ruptures  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  handling and disposal of materials including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids   release of toxic gas  buildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials  pollution and other environmental risks including conditions caused by previous owners or lessors of our properties and   natural disasters    any of these events could result in injury or loss of human life loss of hydrocarbons significant damage to or destruction of property environmental pollution regulatory investigations and penalties suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us   our operation of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures the location of pipelines near populated areas including residential areas commercial business centers and industrial sites could increase these risks as of december 31 2013 we owned or operated approximately 3100 miles of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems as part of our normal maintenance program  29      table of contents we have identified certain segments of our pipelines that we believe periodically require repair replacement or additional maintenance   we may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed   we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses we do not carry business interruption insurance in addition pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable the occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows   we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate   other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest nonoperated wells represented approximately 85 of our total owned gross wells or approximately 25 of our owned net wells as of december 31 2013 we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties including compliance with environmental safety and other regulations or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations an operators breach of the applicable agreements or an operators failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs   terrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business   the threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations acts of terrorism including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable could be directed against companies operating in the united states the us government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations these developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and depending on their ultimate magnitude could have a material adverse effect on our business   competition in our industry is intense and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do which could adversely affect our competitive position   competition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties as well as for the capital equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties our competitive position is affected by price contract terms and quality of service including pipeline connection times distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define evaluate bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit in addition these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry these companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation  30      table of contents  we may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas and oil   from time to time when we believe that market conditions are favorable we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas and crude oil production while there are many different types of derivatives available we generally utilize collar and swap agreements to attempt to manage price risk more effectively   the collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period they provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor the swap agreements call for payments to or receipts from counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices in addition these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances including when   a counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations  production is less than expected or  there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production    the cftc has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions these regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties while we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions andor reduce the availability of new or existing swaps if we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the doddfrank act and regulations our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable   we will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future please read managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item 7a for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives   the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate   our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us in addition our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists engineers and other professionals competition for experienced geologists engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel our ability to compete could be harmed   federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays   most of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells this technology involves the injection of fluidsusually  31      table of contents consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additivesas well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs however the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the safe drinking water act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where epa is the permitting authority including pennsylvania as a result we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations these permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive in addition legislation introduced in congress would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids if adopted this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal state or local levels and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment including groundwater soil or surface water moreover on november 23 2011 the epa announced that it was granting in part a petition to initiate a rulemaking under the toxic substances control act relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and gas exploration and production the epa expects to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in august 2014 further on may 24 2013 the department of the interiors bureau of land management blm issued a proposed rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and indian land the rule would require companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations to the blm after fracturing operations have been completed and includes provisions addressing wellbore integrity and flowback water management plans we voluntarily disclose on a wellbywell basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at wwwfracfocusorg   on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities among other things these final rules require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from natural gas wells through the use of reduced emission completions or green completions on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after january 1 2015 in addition gas wells were required to use completion combustion device equipment ie flaring if emissions cannot be directed to a gathering line further the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology mact standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with these requirements especially the imposition of these green completion requirements may require modifications to certain of our operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs including increased capital expenditures and operating costs and could adversely impact our business   in addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals some states in which we operate such as pennsylvania west virginia and texas and certain local governments have adopted and others are considering adopting regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances including requirements regarding chemical disclosure casing and cementing of wells withdrawal of water for use in highvolume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells baseline testing of nearby water wells and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations for example the railroad commission of texas adopted rules in december 2011 requiring disclosure of  32      table of contents certain information regarding the components used in the hydraulic fracturing process in addition pennsylvanias act 13 of 2012 became law on february 14 2012 and amended the states oil and gas act to impose an impact fee for drilling increase setbacks from certain water sources require water management plans increase civil penalties strengthen the pennsylvania department of environmental protections padep authority over the issuance of drilling permits and require the disclosure of chemical information regarding the components in hydraulic fracturing fluids on december 19 2013 the pennsylvania supreme court struck down as unconstitutional portions of act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules this could result in additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state   we use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations moreover new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste including but not limited to produced water drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of natural gas compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays interruptions or termination of our operations the extent of which cannot be predicted all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition for example in april 2011 padep called on all marcellus shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by may 19 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of padeps total dissolved solids regulations in october 2011 the epa announced that it plans to develop standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works potws which will be proposed in 2014 the regulations will be developed under the epas effluent guidelines program under the authority of the clean water act in response to these actions operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal   a number of federal agencies are analyzing or have been requested to review a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices the epa is conducting a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater the epa released a progress report outlining work currently underway on december 21 2012 and is expected to release a draft report of final results in 2014 this study and other studies that may be undertaken by epa or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act the toxic substances control act or other statutory andor regulatory mechanisms president obama created the interagency working group on unconventional natural gas and oil by executive order on april 13 2012 which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources   climate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce   there is increasing attention in the united states and worldwide concerning the issue of climate change and the effect of greenhouse gases in the united states climate change action is evolving at the state regional and federal levels on december 17 2010 the epa amended the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases final rule reporting rule originally issued in september 2009 the reporting rule establishes a new comprehensive scheme requiring operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxideequivalent greenhouse gases to inventory and report their greenhouse gases emissions annually on a facilitybyfacility basis in addition on december 15 2009 the epa published a final rule finding that current and projected  33      table of contents concentrations of six key greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten public health and the welfare of current and future generations the epa also found that the combined emissions of these greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines contribute to pollution that threatens public health and welfare this final rule also known as the epas endangerment finding does not impose any requirements on industry or other entities directly however following issuance of the endangerment finding epa promulgated final motor vehicle ghg emission standards on april 1 2010 the effect of which could reduce demand for motor fuels refined from crude oil on june 3 2010 epa issued a final rule to address permitting of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v programs this final rule tailors the psd and title v programs to apply to certain stationary sources of ghg emissions in a multi step process with the largest sources first subject to permitting in addition on november 8 2010 epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems which will be added to epas ghg reporting rule facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year were required to report annual ghg emissions to epa for the first time by september 28 2012 we submitted our report in compliance with the deadline   in addition congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases while it is not possible at this time to predict how regulation or legislation that may be enacted to address greenhouse gases emissions would impact our business the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing oil and gas exploration in the areas of the united states in which we operate could materially and adversely affect our operations by limiting drilling opportunities or imposing materially increased costs such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements in addition existing or new laws regulations or treaties including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could have a negative impact on our business if such incentives reduce demand for oil and gas   moreover in 2005 the kyoto protocol to the 1992 united nations framework convention on climate change which establishes a binding set of emission targets for greenhouse gases became binding on all those countries that had ratified it ongoing international discussions following the united nations climate change conference in warsaw poland in november 2013 are exploring options to reduce global emissions by the first quarter of 2015   moreover some experts believe climate change poses potential physical risks including an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events to the extent that such unfavorable weather conditions are exacerbated by global climate change or otherwise our operations may be adversely affected to a greater degree than we have previously experienced including increased delays and costs however the uncertain nature of changes in extreme weather events such as increased frequency duration and severity and the long period of time over which any changes would take place make any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change unreliable   certain federal income tax law changes have been proposed that if passed would have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows   substantive changes to existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that if adopted would repeal many tax incentives and deductions that are currently used by us oil and gas companies and would impose new taxes the proposals include repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties elimination of the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred repeal of the manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas companies and increase in the geological and geophysical amortization period for independent producers should some or all of these proposals become law our taxes will increase potentially significantly which would have a negative  34      table of contents impact on our net income and cash flows this could also reduce our drilling activities in the us since none of these proposals have yet to become law we do not know the ultimate impact these proposed changes may have on our business   provisions of delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment   our charter authorizes our board of directors to set the terms of preferred stock in addition delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders because of these provisions of our charter bylaws and delaware law persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our board of directors rather than pursue nonnegotiated takeover attempts as a result these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent board of directors   the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the delaware general corporation law and by our charter   the delaware general corporation law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law specifically our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director except for liability   for any breach of their duty of loyalty to the company or our stockholders   for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law   under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions and   for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit    this limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care even though such an action if successful might otherwise have benefited our stockholders       item 1b unresolved staff comments    none       item 3 legal proceedings

consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material   overview   on an equivalent basis our production in 2013 increased by 55 from 2012 we produced 4136 bcfe or 11 bcfe per day in 2013 compared to 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 natural gas production increased by 1410 bcf or 56 to 3942 bcf in 2013 compared to 2532 bcf in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale were decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 814 mbbls or 34 from 2407 mbbls in 2012 to 3221 mbbls in 2013 this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused drilling program in south texas and to a lesser extent oklahoma   our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2013 was 356 per mcf 3 lower than the 367 per mcf price realized in 2012 our average realized crude oil price for 2013 was 10113 per bbl less than 1 lower than the 10165 per bbl price realized in 2012 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a   we drilled 181 gross wells 1535 net with a success rate of 98 in 2013 compared to 170 gross wells 1178 net with a success rate of 98 in 2012 our 2013 total capital and exploration spending was 12 billion compared to 9785 million in 2012 the increase in capital spending was the result of our marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania and our drilling program in the eagle ford shale and pearsall shale in south texas in both 2013 and 2012 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2014 our 2014 drilling program includes between 13 billion and 14 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly  42      table of contents  financial condition   capital resources and liquidity   our primary sources of cash in 2013 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations from our commodity derivatives proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties during the year and net borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of debt and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit

consolidated financial statements for further details   we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations   potential impact of our critical accounting policies   readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below   successful efforts method of accounting   we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized   oil and gas reserves   the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves   our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8   our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 006 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 007 per mcfe and an increase of 008 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa rate   in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future  46      table of contents  carrying value of oil and gas properties   we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 73 million or decrease by approximately 49 million respectively per year   as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program   asset retirement obligation   the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities   under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is  47      table of contents designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations   our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks   employee benefit plans   our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans   stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation  48                table of contents   recent accounting pronouncements   effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in asu no 201111 disclosures

commodity derivatives and did not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in

various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations   restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation   operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate   commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results  49      table of contents  the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions   results of operations   2013 and 2012 compared   we reported net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share compared to net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per

from 2012 to 2013 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows   direct operations increased 226 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production in addition we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance costs  transportation and gathering increased 862 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas throughout the second half of 2012   brokered natural gas increased by 14 million from 2012 to 2013 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income decreased 58 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities full year 2012 included 83 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells in addition franchise sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texas   exploration decreased 193 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of 136 million primarily due to our brown densesmackover exploratory well in union county arkansas that was recorded in 2012 there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013 in addition geophysical and geological expenses decreased by 70 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic data  depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1996 million of which 2344 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease of 708 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 144 per mcfe for 2013 compared to 161 per mcfe for 2012 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 355 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as   52      table of contents   a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the year    general and administrative decreased 166 million due to lower pension expense of 195 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012 a decrease in legal expenses of 90 million and 22 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012 these decreases are partially offset by 183 million of higher stockbased compensation expense associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013    gain  loss on sale of assets during 2013 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of 195 million during 2012 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas   interest expense and other net interest expense and other decreased by 34 million as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of 13 million associated with our credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of 75 million of our 733 weightedaverage fixed rate notes in july 2013 these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our credit facility due to an increase in weightedaverage borrowings under our revolving credit facility based on daily balances of approximately 4544 million during 2013 compared to approximately 2838 million 2012 partially offset by a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings of approximately 23 during 2013 compared to approximately 30 during 2012   income tax expense income tax expense increased by 997 million due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate  the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were 424 and 446 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes  53      table of contents  2012 and 2011 compared   we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 029 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset higher operating costs   revenue price and volume variances   below is a discussion of revenue price and volume variances

which increased the price by 500 per bbl in 2012 and 101 per bbl in 2011   natural gas revenues   the increase in natural gas revenues of 1367 million excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is due to higher production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and lower production in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to oilfocused drilling and normal production declines   crude oil and condensate revenues   the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1020 million is primarily due to higher production associated with our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma and higher realized oil prices  54

costs and expenses from operations increased by 2127 million from 2011 to 2012 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows   direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase were higher employee related expenses and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs   transportation and gathering increased 700 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production and transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering arrangements in late 2011 and throughout 2012 primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas   brokered natural gas decreased 153 million from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income increased 213 million due to additional costs associated with the passage of an impact fee in pennsylvania on marcellus shale production that was imposed by state legislature in february 2012 and higher production tax expense due to fewer production tax refunds and credits received in 2012 compared to 2011  exploration increased 10 million as the result of increased exploration activity partially offset by lower geophysical and geological costs due to fewer acquisitions and purchases of seismic data  depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1083 million which includes a 1314 million increase due to higher equivalent production volumes partially offset by an 85 million decrease due to a lower ddampa rate of 161 per mcfe for 2012 compared to 164 mcfe for 2011 the increase in ddampa was offset by a decrease in amortization of unproved properties of 144 million as a result of a decrease in amortization rates due to the success of our drilling programs in pennsylvania and south texas and the sale of certain pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas in the second quarter of 2012  general and administrative increased by 166 million due to higher pension expense of 140 million associated with the termination of our qualified pension plan and the related settlement that occurred in the second quarter 2012 and higher legal costs and professional fees of 60 million also contributing to the increase was the accrual of 19 million associated with   56      table of contents   fines and penalties assessed by the office of natural resources revenue for certain alleged volume reporting matters which we are currently disputing related to properties we no longer own and a 22 million charitable contribution to fund the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania these increases were partially offset by 63 million of lower stockbased compensation expense primarily associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price in 2012 compared to 2011     gain  loss on sale of assets during 2012 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas during the 2011 an aggregate net gain of 634 million was recognized primarily due to the sale of certain undeveloped leaseholds in east texas and the sale of other noncore assets   interest expense net interest expense and other decreased by 34 million due to a decrease in the weightedaverage effective interest rate on the credit facility which decreased to approximately 30 during 2012 compared to approximately 41 during 2011 partially offset by a decrease in weighted average borrowings under our credit facility based on weightedaverage debt of 2838 million in 2012 compared to weightedaverage debt of 3177 million in 2011   income tax expense income tax expense decreased by 67 million due a lower effective tax rate partially offset by increased pretax income the effective tax rates for 2012 and 2011 were 446 and 480 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes       item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    market risk   our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable   derivative instruments and hedging activities   our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements   periodically we enter into commodity derivative instruments including collar and swap agreements to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures  57      table of contents  as of

fair value asset liability column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2013 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks   during 2013 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 309 to 515 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 398 to 623 per mcf covered 2417 bcf or 61 of our natural gas production at an average price of 396 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 1095 mbbl or 38 of our crude oil production at an average price 10190 per bbl   we are exposed to market risk on our commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal goldman sachs ing capital markets jpmorgan and morgan stanley   fair market value of other financial instruments   the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments   the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us  58      table of contents  we use

hydrocarbon resources which are conducive to multiwell repeatable drilling programs   the company operates in one segment natural gas and crude oil development exploitation and exploration the companys oil and gas properties are managed as a whole rather than through discrete operating segments or business units operational information is tracked by geographic area however financial performance is assessed as a single enterprise and not on a geographic basis allocation of resources is made on a project basis across the companys entire portfolio without regard to geographic areas   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its subsidiaries after eliminating all significant intercompany balances and transactions certain reclassifications have been made to prior year statements to conform with current year presentation these reclassifications have no impact on previously reported net income   on july 23 2013 the board of directors declared

efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities under this method acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole drilling costs are expensed development costs including the costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized   exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when incurred pending the determination of whether a well has found proved reserves the determination is based on a process which relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical and engineering data if a well is determined to be successful the capitalized drilling costs will be reclassified as part of the cost of the well if a well is determined to be unsuccessful the capitalized drilling costs will be charged to exploration expense in the period the determination is made if an exploratory well requires a major capital expenditure before production can begin the cost of drilling the exploratory well will continue to be carried as an asset pending determination of whether reserves have been found only as long as i the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well if the required capital expenditure is made and ii drilling of an additional exploratory well is under way or firmly planned for the near future if drilling in the area is not under way or firmly planned or if the well has not found a commercially producible quantity of reserves the exploratory well is assumed to be impaired and its costs are charged to exploration expense   development costs of proved oil and gas properties including estimated dismantlement restoration and abandonment costs and acquisition costs are depreciated and depleted on a field basis by the unitsofproduction method using proved developed and proved reserves respectively properties related to gathering and pipeline systems and equipment are depreciated using the straightline method based on estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 25 years generally pipeline and transmission systems are depreciated over 12 to 25 years gathering and compression equipment is depreciated over 10 years and storage equipment and facilities are depreciated over 10 to 16 years buildings are depreciated on a straightline basis over 25 to 40 years certain other assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over 3 to 10 years   costs of retired sold or abandoned properties that make up a part of an amortization base partial field are charged to accumulated depreciation depletion and amortization if the unitsofproduction rate is not significantly affected accordingly a gain or loss if any is recognized only when a group of proved properties entire field that make up the amortization base has been retired abandoned or sold   the

based on estimates of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to the companys undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience the companys expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights during 2013 2012 and 2011 amortization associated with the companys unproved properties was 536 million 181 million and 325 million respectively and is included in depreciation depletion and amortization in the consolidated statement of operations   asset retirement obligations   the company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the longlived asset the asset retirement costs are depreciated using the unitsofproduction method over the assets useful life the majority of the asset retirement obligations recorded by the company relate to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells however liabilities are also recorded for meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors at december 31 2013 there were no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations   additional retirement obligations increase the liability associated with new oil and gas wells and other facilities as these obligations are incurred accretion expense is included in depreciation depletion and amortization expense in the consolidated statement of operations   derivative and hedging activities   the company enters into derivative contracts such as swaps or collars as a hedging strategy to manage commodity price risk associated with its production or other contractual commitments all hedge transactions are subject to the companys risk management policy which does not permit speculative trading activities gains or losses on these hedging activities are generally recognized over the period that its production or other underlying commitment is hedged as an offset to the specific hedged item cash flows related to any recognized gains or losses associated with these hedges are reported as cash flows from operations if a hedge is terminated prior to expected maturity gains or losses are deferred and included in income in the same period that the underlying production or other contractual commitment is delivered unrealized gains or losses associated with any derivative contract not considered a hedge are recognized currently in the results of operations   when the designated item associated with a derivative instrument matures or is sold extinguished or terminated derivative gains or losses are recognized as part of the gain or loss on the sale or settlement of the underlying item when a derivative instrument is associated with an anticipated  69      table of contents  1 summary of significant accounting policies continued  transaction that is no longer expected to occur or if the hedge is no longer effective the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in the results of operations to

and crude oil sales result from interests in oil and gas properties owned by the company sales of natural gas and crude oil are recognized when the product is delivered and title transfers to the purchaser payment is generally received one to three months after the sale has occurred   producer gas imbalances the company applies the sales method of accounting for natural gas revenue under this method revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of natural gas sold to purchasers natural gas production operations may include joint owners who take more or less than the production volumes entitled to them on certain properties production volume is monitored to minimize these natural gas imbalances a natural gas imbalance liability is recorded if the companys excess takes of natural gas exceed its estimated remaining proved developed reserves for these properties at the actual price realized upon the gas sale   brokered natural gas revenues and expenses related to brokering natural gas are reported gross as part of operating revenues and operating expenses in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company buys and sells natural gas utilizing separate purchase and sale transactions typically with separate counterparties whereby the company andor the counterparty takes title to the natural gas purchased or sold   income taxes   the company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year of the enacted rate change a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized   the company is required to make judgments including estimating reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that the company has taken the company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition and measurement threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position the amount of the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of the benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement the effective tax rate and the tax basis of assets and liabilities reflect managements estimates of the ultimate outcome of various tax uncertainties   the company recognizes

depending on the specific provisions of the award stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations   the tax benefit for stockbased compensation is included as both a cash inflow from financing activities and a cash outflow from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows the company recognizes a tax benefit only to the extent it reduces the companys income taxes payable   environmental matters   environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate depending on their future economic benefit expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed liabilities related to future costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental assessments andor remediation activities are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated any insurance recoveries are recorded as assets when received   credit and concentration risk   substantially all of the companys accounts receivable result from the sale of natural gas and crude oil and joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and gas industry this concentration of purchasers and joint interest owners may impact the companys overall credit risk either positively or negatively in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions the company does not anticipate any material impact on its financial results due to nonperformance by the third parties

fair value measurements   the company follows the authoritative accounting guidance for measuring fair values of assets and liabilities in financial statements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price the company utilizes market data or assumptions that market participants who are independent knowledgeable and willing and able to transact would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique the company is able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of these inputs the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined as follows   level 1 unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets   level 2 quoted prices in markets that are not considered to be active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  level 3 significant unobservable inputs for use when little or no market data exists requiring a significant degree of judgment    the hierarchy gives the highest priority to level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to level 3 measurements depending on the particular asset or liability input availability can vary depending on factors such as product type longevity of a product in the market and other particular transaction conditions in some cases certain inputs used to measure fair value may be categorized into different levels of the fair value hierarchy for disclosure purposes under the accounting guidance the lowest level that contains significant inputs used in valuation should be chosen   nonfinancial assets and liabilities   the company discloses or recognizes its nonfinancial assets and liabilities such as impairments of oil and gas properties and other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as none of the companys other nonfinancial assets and liabilities were impaired as of december 31 2013 2012 and  80      table of contents  7 fair value measurements continued  2011 and no other fair value measurements were required to be recognized on a nonrecurring

adjusted riskfree rate which takes into account the companys credit risk the time value of money and the current economic state to the undiscounted expected abandonment cash flows given the unobservable nature of the inputs the measurement of the asset retirement obligation was classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy   financial assets and liabilities   the following fair value

should be aware that the process of estimating quantities of proved and proved developed natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological engineering and economic data for each reservoir the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including but not limited to additional development activity evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions as a result revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various reservoirs make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures   estimates of total proved reserves at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 were based on studies performed by the companys petroleum engineering staff the estimates were computed using the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the respective year the estimates were audited by miller and lents ltd miller and lents who indicated that based on their investigation and subject to the limitations described in their audit letter they believe the results of those estimates and projections were reasonable in the aggregate   no major discovery or other favorable or unfavorable event after december 31 2013 is believed to have caused a material change in the estimates of proved or proved developed reserves as of that date  106      table of contents  the following tables illustrate the companys net proved reserves including changes and proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves

measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves   the following information has been developed based on natural gas and crude oil reserve and production volumes estimated by the companys engineering staff it can be used for some comparisons but should not be the only method used to evaluate the company or its performance further the information in the following table may not represent realistic assessments of future cash flows nor should the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows be viewed as representative of the current value of the company  108      table of contents  the company believes that the following factors should be taken into account when reviewing the following information   future costs and selling prices will probably differ from those required to be used in these calculations   due to future market conditions and governmental regulations actual rates of production in future years may vary significantly from the rate of production assumed in the calculations  selection of a 10 discount rate is arbitrary and may not be a reasonable measure of the relative risk that is part of realizing future net oil and gas revenues  future net revenues may be subject to different rates of income taxation    under the standardized measure future cash inflows for 2013 2012 and 2011 were estimated by using the 12month average crude oil and natural gas index prices calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month during the year   the average prices adjusted for basis and quality differentials related to proved reserves at december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 for natural gas  per mcf were 358 283 and 427 for crude oil  per bbl were 10117 10202 and 9400 and for ngls  per bbl were 2811 3788 and 6733 respectively future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future development and production costs based on year end costs to arrive at net cash flow before tax future income tax expense was computed by applying year end statutory tax rates to future pretax net cash flows less the tax basis of the properties involved and utilization of available tax carryforwards related to oil and gas operations the applicable accounting standards require the use of a 10 discount rate   management does not solely use the following information when making investment and operating decisions these decisions are based on a number of factors including estimates of proved reserves and varying price and cost assumptions considered more representative of a
