    market risk   our primary market risk is exposure to natural gas and crude oil prices realized prices are mainly driven by worldwide prices for crude oil and market prices for north american natural gas production commodity prices can be volatile and unpredictable   derivative instruments and hedging activities   our hedging strategy is designed to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets a hedging committee that consists of members of senior management oversees our hedging activity our hedging arrangements apply to only a portion of our production and provide only partial price protection these hedging arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices but offer protection in the event of price declines further if our counterparties defaulted this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges please read the discussion below as well as note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our hedging arrangements   periodically we enter into commodity derivative instruments including collar and swap agreements to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations on natural gas and crude oil production our credit agreement restricts our ability to enter into commodity hedges other than to hedge or mitigate risks to which we have actual or projected exposure or as permitted under our risk management policies and not subjecting us to material speculative risks all of our derivatives are used for risk management purposes and are not held for trading purposes under the collar agreements if the index price rises above the ceiling price we pay the counterparty if the index price falls below the floor price the counterparty pays us under the swap agreements we receive a fixed price on a notional quantity of natural gas or crude oil in exchange for paying a variable price based on a marketbased index such as the nymex gas and crude oil futures  57      table of contents  as of december 31 2013 we had the following outstanding commodity derivatives designated as hedging instruments                                              collars

mcf the amounts set forth under the estimated fair value asset liability column in the table above represent our total unrealized derivative position at december 31 2013 and exclude the impact of nonperformance risk nonperformance risk is primarily evaluated by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks   during 2013 natural gas collars with floor prices ranging from 309 to 515 per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from 398 to 623 per mcf covered 2417 bcf or 61 of our natural gas production at an average price of 396 per mcf crude oil swaps covered 1095 mbbl or 38 of our crude oil production at an average price 10190 per bbl   we are exposed to market risk on our commodity derivative instruments to the extent of changes in market prices of natural gas and crude oil however the market risk exposure on these derivative contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity although notional contract amounts are used to express the volume of natural gas agreements the amounts that can be subject to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by third parties are substantially smaller we do not anticipate any material impact on our financial results due to nonperformance by third parties our primary derivative contract counterparties are bank of america bank of montreal goldman sachs ing capital markets jpmorgan and morgan stanley   fair market value of other financial instruments   the estimated fair value of other financial instruments is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged currently between willing parties the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the shortterm maturities of these instruments   the fair value of longterm debt is the estimated amount we would have to pay a third party to assume the debt including a credit spread for the difference between the issue rate and the period end market rate the credit spread is our default or repayment risk the credit spread premium or discount is determined by comparing our fixedrate notes and credit facility to new issuances secured and unsecured and secondary trades of similar size and credit statistics for both public and private debt the fair value of all of the fixedrate notes and the credit facility is based on interest rates currently available to us  58      table of contents  we use available market data and valuation methodologies to estimate the fair value of debt the carrying amounts and fair
