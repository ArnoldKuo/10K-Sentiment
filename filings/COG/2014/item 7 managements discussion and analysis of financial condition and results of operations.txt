    the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our results of operations and our present financial condition our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form 10k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material   overview   on an equivalent basis our production in 2013 increased by 55 from 2012 we produced 4136 bcfe or 11 bcfe per day in 2013 compared to 2677 bcfe or 7314 mmcfe per day in 2012 natural gas production increased by 1410 bcf or 56 to 3942 bcf in 2013 compared to 2532 bcf in 2012 this increase was primarily the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and continued expansion of infrastructure in the area partially offsetting the production increase in the marcellus shale were decreases in production primarily in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to reduced natural gas drilling and normal production declines crude oilcondensatengl production increased by 814 mbbls or 34 from 2407 mbbls in 2012 to 3221 mbbls in 2013 this increase was the result of higher production resulting from our oilfocused drilling program in south texas and to a lesser extent oklahoma   our financial results depend on many factors particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms our average realized natural gas price for 2013 was 356 per mcf 3 lower than the 367 per mcf price realized in 2012 our average realized crude oil price for 2013 was 10113 per bbl less than 1 lower than the 10165 per bbl price realized in 2012 these realized prices include realized gains and losses resulting from commodity derivatives for information about the impact of these derivatives on realized prices refer to results of operations in item 7 commodity prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control historically commodity prices have been volatile and we expect them to remain volatile commodity prices are affected by changes in market supply and demand which are impacted by overall economic activity weather pipeline capacity constraints inventory storage levels basis differentials and other factors as a result we cannot accurately predict future natural gas ngl and crude oil prices and therefore we cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program production volumes or future revenues in addition to production volumes and commodity prices finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil reserves at economical costs are critical to our longterm success see risk factorsnatural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business and risk factorsour future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable in item 1a   we drilled 181 gross wells 1535 net with a success rate of 98 in 2013 compared to 170 gross wells 1178 net with a success rate of 98 in 2012 our 2013 total capital and exploration spending was 12 billion compared to 9785 million in 2012 the increase in capital spending was the result of our marcellus shale horizontal drilling program in northeast pennsylvania and our drilling program in the eagle ford shale and pearsall shale in south texas in both 2013 and 2012 we allocated our planned program for capital and exploration expenditures among our various operating areas based on return expectations availability of services and human resources we plan to continue such method of allocation in 2014 our 2014 drilling program includes between 13 billion and 14 billion in capital and exploration expenditures funding of the program is expected to be provided by operating cash flow existing cash and if required borrowings under our credit facility we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment along with our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration expenditures accordingly  42      table of contents  financial condition   capital resources and liquidity   our primary sources of cash in 2013 were from funds generated from the sale of natural gas and crude oil production including hedge realizations from our commodity derivatives proceeds from the sales of certain oil and gas properties during the year and net borrowings under our credit facility these cash flows were primarily used to fund our capital and exploration expenditures repayments of debt and related interest payments share repurchases and the payment of dividends see below for additional discussion and analysis of cash flow   operating cash flow fluctuations are substantially driven by commodity prices and changes in our production volumes and operating expenses prices for natural gas and crude oil have historically been volatile including seasonal influences characterized by peak demand however the impact of other risks and uncertainties have also influenced prices throughout the recent years in addition fluctuations in cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our capital and exploration expenditures see results of operations for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on revenues   our working capital is also substantially influenced by variables discussed above from time to time our working capital will reflect a surplus while at other times it will reflect a deficit this fluctuation is not unusual we believe we have adequate availability under our credit facility and liquidity available to meet our working capital requirements                         year ended december 31      in thousands     2013    2012    2011       cash flows provided by operating activities    1024526

cash provided by operating activities in 2013 increased by 3724 million over 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production partially offset by lower realized natural gas and crude oil prices equivalent production volumes increased by 55 for 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas and crude oil prices decreased by 3 and less than 1 respectively for 2013 compared to 2012   net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 increased by 1503 million over 2011 this increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses excluding noncash expenses and unfavorable changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in equivalent production and higher realized crude oil prices partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices equivalent production volumes increased by 43 for 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of higher natural gas and crude oil production average realized natural gas prices decreased by 18 for 2012 compared to 2011 while average realized crude oil prices increased by 12 compared to the same period   see results of operations for additional information relative to commodity price production and operating expense movements we are unable to predict future commodity prices and as a result cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities realized prices may decline in future periods   investing activities cash flows used in investing activities increased by 1527 million from 2012 to 2013 due to a 2668 million increase in capital and exploration expenditures and a 120 million  43      table of contents increase associated with our equity investment in constitution these increases were partially offset by a net 1261 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets a portion of which was retained in a qualified intermediary and recognized as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet the 2779 million increase from 2011 to 2012 was due to a decrease of 2343 million of proceeds from the sale of assets an increase of 367 million in capital and exploration expenditures and an increase of 69 million associated with our equity investment in constitution   financing activities cash flows used in financing activities increased by 2279 million from 2012 to 2013 due to 1646 million of stock repurchases 770 million of lower net borrowings and an increase in dividends paid of 85 million partially offset by an 189 increase in the tax benefit associated with our stockbased compensation and a decrease in cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 23 million cash flows provided by financing activities increased by 1545 million from 2011 to 2012 due to 1620 million of higher net borrowings partially offset by an increase in dividends paid of 42 million and cash paid for capitalized debt issuance costs of 40 million   in december 2013 we exercised the 500 million accordion feature of our amended credit facility thereby increasing the available credit line to 14 billion as of december 31 2013 the borrowing base under our amended credit facility was 23 billion see note 5 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details   at december 31 2013 we had 4600 million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at a weightedaverage interest rate of 20 compared to 3250 million of borrowings outstanding at a weightedaverage interest rate of 22 at december 31 2012 as of december 31 2013 we had 9390 million available for future borrowings under our credit facility   we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit facility and fixed rate notes as of december 31 2013   we strive to manage our debt at a level below the available credit line in order to maintain borrowing capacity our credit facility includes a covenant limiting our total debt management believes that with internally generated cash flow existing cash

quarterly dividend on our common stock from 001 per share to 002 per share a regular dividend has been declared for each quarter since we became a public company in 1990  44      table of contents  capital and exploration expenditures   on an annual basis we generally fund most of our capital and exploration expenditures excluding any significant property acquisitions with cash generated from operations and when necessary borrowings under our credit facility we budget these expenditures based on our projected cash flows for the year   the following table presents major components of our

in 2014 we plan to spend between approximately 13 billion and 14 billion in total capital and exploration expenditures excluding expected contributions of approximately 364 million to constitution compared to 12 billion in 2013 we will continue to assess the natural gas and crude oil price environment and our liquidity position and may increase or decrease our capital and exploration

                     1interest payments have been calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at december 31 2013 interest payments on our credit facility were calculated by assuming that the december 31 2013 outstanding balance of 4600 million will be outstanding through the may 2017 maturity date a constant interest rate of 20 was assumed which was the december 31 2013 weightedaverage interest rate actual results will differ from these estimates and assumptions 2for further information on our obligations under transportation and gathering agreements drilling rig commitments and operating leases see note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 3for further information on our equity investment contribution commitment see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  45      table of contents  amounts related to our asset retirement obligation are not included in the above table given the uncertainty regarding the actual timing of such expenditures the total amount of our asset retirement obligation at december 31 2013 was 759 million see note 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details   we have no offbalance sheet debt or other similar unrecorded obligations   potential impact of our critical accounting policies   readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place our most significant policies are discussed below   successful efforts method of accounting   we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities acquisition costs for proved and unproved properties are capitalized when incurred exploration costs including geological and geophysical costs the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed development costs including costs to drill and equip development wells and successful exploratory drilling costs to locate proved reserves are capitalized   oil and gas reserves   the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently imprecise and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates the process relies on interpretations of available geologic geophysical engineering and production data the extent quality and reliability of this technical data can vary the process also requires certain economic assumptions some of which are mandated by the sec such as oil and gas prices additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses capital expenditures taxes and availability of funds any significant variance in the interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves   our reserves have been prepared by our petroleum engineering staff and audited by miller and lents independent petroleum engineers who in their opinion determined the estimates presented to be reasonable in the aggregate for more information regarding reserve estimation including historical reserve revisions refer to the supplemental oil and gas information to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8   our rate of recording ddampa expense is dependent upon our estimate of proved and proved developed reserves which are utilized in our unitofproduction calculation if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced the rate at which we record ddampa expense would increase reducing net income such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices which may make it uneconomic to drill and produce higher cost fields a 5 positive or negative revision to proved reserves would result in a decrease of 006 per mcfe and an increase of 007 per mcfe respectively on our ddampa rate revisions in significant fields may individually affect our ddampa rate it is estimated that a positive or negative reserve revision of 10 in one of our most productive fields would result in a decrease of 007 per mcfe and an increase of 008 per mcfe respectively on our total ddampa rate these estimated impacts are based on current data and actual events could require different adjustments to our ddampa rate   in addition a decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of our impairment test under applicable accounting standards due to the inherent imprecision of the reserve estimation process risks associated with the operations of proved producing properties and market sensitive commodity prices utilized in our impairment analysis management cannot determine if an impairment is reasonably likely to occur in the future  46      table of contents  carrying value of oil and gas properties   we evaluate our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a fieldbyfield basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an assets carrying amount may not be recoverable we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset if the future undiscounted expected cash flows based on our estimate of future natural gas and crude oil prices operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and riskadjusted probable and possible reserves are lower than the net book value of the asset the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices in the event that commodity prices remain low or decline there could be a significant revision in the future fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows the discount factor used is based on rates utilized by market participants that are commensurate with the risks inherent in the development and production of the underlying natural gas and crude oil   unproved oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on an aggregate basis through periodic updates to our undeveloped acreage amortization based on past drilling and exploration experience our expectation of converting leases to held by production and average property lives average property lives are determined on a geographical basis and based on the estimated life of unproved property leasehold rights historically the average property life in each of the geographical areas has not significantly changed and generally range from three to five years the commodity price environment may impact the capital available for exploration projects as well as development drilling we have considered these impacts when determining the amortization rate of our undeveloped acreage especially in exploratory areas if the average unproved property life decreases or increases by one year the amortization would increase by approximately 73 million or decrease by approximately 49 million respectively per year   as these properties are developed and reserves are proven the remaining capitalized costs are subject to depreciation and depletion if the development of these properties is deemed unsuccessful the capitalized costs related to the unsuccessful activity is expensed in the year the determination is made the rate at which the unproved properties are written off depends on the timing and success of our future exploration and development program   asset retirement obligation   the majority of our asset retirement obligation aro relates to the plugging and abandonment of oil and gas wells and to a lesser extent meter stations pipelines processing plants and compressors we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred with the associated asset retirement cost capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related longlived asset the recognition of an asset retirement obligation requires management to make assumptions that include estimated plugging and abandonment costs timing of settlements inflation rates and discount rate in periods subsequent to initial measurement the asset retirement cost is depreciated using the unitsofproduction method over the assets useful life while increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time accretion expense are reflected as depreciation depletion and amortization expense   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities   under applicable accounting standards the fair value of each derivative instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet at the end of each quarterly period these instruments are markedtomarket the gain or loss on the change in fair value is recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income a component of equity to the extent that the derivative instrument is  47      table of contents designated as a hedge and is effective the ineffective portion if any of the change in the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges and the change in fair value of derivatives not qualifying as hedges are recorded currently in earnings as a component of natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenue in the consolidated statement of operations   our derivative contracts are measured based on quotes from our counterparties such quotes have been derived using an income approach that considers various inputs including current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments quoted forward prices for natural gas and crude oil basis differentials volatility factors and interest rates such as a libor curve for a similar length of time as the derivative contract term as applicable these estimates are verified using relevant nymex futures contracts or are compared to multiple quotes obtained from counterparties for reasonableness the determination of fair value also incorporates a credit adjustment for nonperformance risk we measure the nonperformance risk of our counterparties by reviewing credit default swap spreads for the various financial institutions in which we have derivative transactions while our nonperformance risk is evaluated using a market credit spread provided by one of our banks   employee benefit plans   our costs of longterm employee benefits particularly postretirement benefits are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions it is managements responsibility often with the assistance of independent experts to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties it also is managements responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions significant assumptions used to determine our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs include discount rates and health care cost trends see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion relative to our employee benefit plans   stockbased compensation   we account for stockbased compensation under the fair value based method of accounting in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the fair value method compensation cost is measured at the grant date for equityclassified awards and remeasured each reporting period for liabilityclassified awards based on the fair value of an award and is recognized over the service period which is generally the vesting period to calculate fair value we use either a binomial or blackscholes valuation model depending on the specific provisions of the award the use of these models requires significant judgment with respect to expected life volatility and other factors stockbased compensation cost for all types of awards is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation  48                table of contents   recent accounting pronouncements   effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in asu no 201111 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities and asu no 201301 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities this guidance impacted the disclosures associated with our commodity derivatives and did not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   effective january 1 2013 we adopted the amended disclosure requirements prescribed in asu no 201302 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income this guidance impacted our disclosures associated with items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income  loss and did not impact our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows   other issues and contingencies   regulations our operations are subject to various types of regulation by federal state and local authorities see regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production natural gas marketing gathering and transportation federal regulation of petroleum pipeline safety regulation and environmental and safety regulations in the other business matters section of item 1 for a discussion of these regulations   restrictive covenants our ability to incur debt and to make certain types of investments is subject to certain restrictive covenants in our various debt instruments among other requirements our revolving credit agreement and our fixed rate notes specify a minimum annual coverage ratio of operating cash flow to interest expense for the trailing four quarters of 28 to 10 and an asset coverage ratio of the present value of proved reserves plus adjusted cash to indebtedness and other liabilities of 175 to 10 our revolving credit agreement also requires us to maintain a current ratio of 10 to 10 at december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all restrictive financial covenants in both the revolving credit agreement and fixed rate notes in the unforeseen event that we fail to comply with these covenants we may apply for a temporary waiver with the lender which if granted would allow us a period of time to remedy the situation   operating risks and insurance coverage our business involves a variety of operating risks see risk factorswe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses in item 1a in accordance with customary industry practice we maintain insurance against some but not all of these risks and losses the occurrence of any of these events not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows the costs of these insurance policies are somewhat dependent on our historical claims experience and also the areas in which we operate   commodity pricing and risk management activities our revenues operating results financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil declines in natural gas and crude oil prices may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity ability to obtain financing and operating results lower natural gas and crude oil prices also may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically historically natural gas and crude oil prices and markets have been volatile with prices fluctuating widely and they are likely to continue to be volatile depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on our future financial results in particular substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially trigger an impairment of our longlived assets because our reserves are predominantly natural gas changes in natural gas prices may have a more significant impact on our financial results  49      table of contents  the majority of our production is sold at market responsive prices generally if the related commodity index declines the price that we receive for our production will also decline therefore the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control however management may mitigate this price risk on all or a portion of our anticipated production with the use of derivative financial instruments most recently we have used financial instruments such as collar and swap arrangements to reduce the impact of declining prices on our revenue under both arrangements there is also a risk that the movement of index prices may result in our inability to realize the full benefit of an improvement in market conditions   results of operations   2013 and 2012 compared   we reported net income for 2013 of 2798 million or 067 per share compared to net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share the increase in net income was due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and

  94        total costs and expenses from operations increased by 2681 million from 2012 to 2013 the primary reasons for this fluctuation are as follows   direct operations increased 226 million largely due to higher operating costs primarily driven by higher production in addition we experienced higher costs associated with oil separation and processing and related fuel charges as a result of more stringent oil pipeline quality requirements in south texas higher plugging and abandonment costs primarily in east texas and higher environmental and regulatory costs partially offsetting these increases were a decrease in workover activity and lower lease maintenance costs  transportation and gathering increased 862 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production slightly higher transportation rates and the commencement of various transportation and gathering agreements primarily in northeast pennsylvania and south texas throughout the second half of 2012   brokered natural gas increased by 14 million from 2012 to 2013 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income decreased 58 million due to lower drilling impact fees associated with our marcellus shale drilling activities full year 2012 included 83 million related to the initial assessment of drilling impact fees associated with 2011 and prior period wells in addition franchise sales and use and ad valorem taxes decreased year over year these decreases were partially offset by higher production taxes as a result of an increase in oil production in south texas   exploration decreased 193 million due to lower exploratory dry hole costs of 136 million primarily due to our brown densesmackover exploratory well in union county arkansas that was recorded in 2012 there were no significant exploratory dry hole costs recorded in 2013 in addition geophysical and geological expenses decreased by 70 million due to fewer requirements for the acquisition and processing of seismic data  depreciation depletion and amortization increased 1996 million of which 2344 million was due to higher equivalent production volumes for 2013 compared to 2012 partially offset by a decrease of 708 million due to a lower ddampa rate of 144 per mcfe for 2013 compared to 161 per mcfe for 2012 the lower ddampa rate was primarily due to lower cost of reserve additions associated with our 2013 and 2012 drilling programs in addition amortization of unproved properties increased 355 million primarily due to an increase in amortization rates as   52      table of contents   a result of our ongoing evaluation of our unproved properties and undeveloped leasehold acquisitions during the year    general and administrative decreased 166 million due to lower pension expense of 195 million associated with the liquidation of our pension plan that occurred in the second quarter of 2012 a decrease in legal expenses of 90 million and 22 million of lower charitable contribution costs associated with the funding of the construction of a hospital in northeast pennsylvania in 2012 these decreases are partially offset by 183 million of higher stockbased compensation expense associated with the marktomarket of our liabilitybased performance awards due to changes in our stock price during 2013 compared to 2012 and the achievement of the interim and final triggers of our supplemental incentive compensation plan during 2013    gain  loss on sale of assets during 2013 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 214 million which includes a 194 million gain from the sale of certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in the oklahoma and texas panhandles and a 175 million loss from the sale certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties located in oklahoma texas and kansas we also sold various other proved and unproved properties for a net gain of 195 million during 2012 we recognized an aggregate net gain of 506 million which includes a 670 million gain associated with the sale of certain of our pearsall shale undeveloped leaseholds in south texas partially offset by an 182 million loss on the sale of certain proved oil and gas properties located in south texas   interest expense and other net interest expense and other decreased by 34 million as a result lower debt extinguishment costs of 13 million associated with our credit facility amendment in may 2012 and lower interest expense as a result of the repayment of 75 million of our 733 weightedaverage fixed rate notes in july 2013 these decreases were offset by an increase in interest expense related to our credit facility due to an increase in weightedaverage borrowings under our revolving credit facility based on daily balances of approximately 4544 million during 2013 compared to approximately 2838 million 2012 partially offset by a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate on our revolving credit facility borrowings of approximately 23 during 2013 compared to approximately 30 during 2012   income tax expense income tax expense increased by 997 million due to an increase in pretax income offset by a lower effective tax rate  the effective tax rates for 2013 and 2012 were 424 and 446 respectively the effective tax rate was lower due to a decrease in the impact of our state rates used in establishing deferred income taxes  53      table of contents  2012 and 2011 compared   we reported net income for 2012 of 1317 million or 031 per share compared to net income for 2011 of 1224 million or 029 per share the increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in natural gas and crude oil and condensate revenues partially offset higher operating costs   revenue price and volume variances   below is a

excluding the impact of the unrealized losses discussed above is due to higher production partially offset by lower realized natural gas prices the increase in our production was the result of higher production in the marcellus shale associated with our drilling program and expanded infrastructure partially offset by the sale of certain oil and gas properties in the rockies in the fourth quarter of 2011 and lower production in texas oklahoma and west virginia due to a shift from natural gas to oilfocused drilling and normal production declines   crude oil and condensate revenues   the increase in crude oil and condensate revenues of 1020 million is primarily due to higher production associated with our eagle ford shale drilling program in south texas and the marmaton oil play in oklahoma and higher realized oil prices  54                 table of contents   brokered natural gas                               year ended december 31                      variance    price and

direct operations increased 108 million largely due to increased operating costs primarily driven by increased production contributing to the increase were higher employee related expenses and lease maintenance costs partially offset by lower workover costs   transportation and gathering increased 700 million due to higher throughput as a result of higher production and transportation rates and

from 2011 to 2012 see the preceding table titled brokered natural gas revenue and cost for further analysis  taxes other than income increased 213 million due to additional costs associated with the
