wholesale cooperative and independent grocery accounts convenience stores drug stores value stores bakeries pharmacies mass merchants club stores foodservice distributors and institutions including hotels restaurants hospitals health care facilities and certain government agencies our largest customer walmart stores inc represented approximately 22 of our net sales in 2016  approximately 20 of our net sales in 2015 and approximately 10 of our net sales in 2014additionally we have significant customers in different regions around the world however none of these customers individually are material to our consolidated business in 2016 the five largest customers in our united states segment accounted for approximately 49 of united states segment sales the five largest customers in our canada segment accounted for approximately 76 of canada segment sales and the five largest customers in our europe segment accounted for approximately 31 of our europe segment salesraw materials and packagingwe manufacture and contract for the manufacture of our products from a wide variety of raw food materials we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat and other goods to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status andor have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programsthe most significant cost components of our cheese products are dairy commodities including milk and cheese we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components in our meat business include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on world markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and world markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of price2our risk management group works with our procurement teams to monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources our risk management group uses a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor any changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measurescompetitionwe face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and generic products in addition to retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation brand recognition and loyalty service the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs distribution shelf space merchandising support and price improving our market position or introducing a new product

liability act cercla cercla imposes joint and several liability on each potentially responsible party we are involved in a number of active proceedings in the united states under cercla and other similar state actions and legislation related to our current operations and certain closed inactive or divested operations for which we retain liability we do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial conditionas of december 31 2016 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial condition however it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reservesforeign operationsin 2016 we generated a significant amount of our net sales from operations outside of the united states and sold our products in approximately 190

information regarding issuers including kraft heinz that are electronically filed with the secitem 1a risk factorswe operate in a highly competitive industrythe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings we compete based on product innovation price product quality service taste convenience brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferenceswe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including changing consumer preferences that may adversely impact the market for our products these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may suffermaintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business successwe have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition across the globe our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offeringswe seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing negative attention on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us our quality and safety our environmental or social impacts or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence and reduce demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 6in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation in addition we might fail to anticipate consumer preferences invest sufficiently in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affectedour international operations subject us to additional risks and costs and may cause our profitability to declinewe are a global company with sales or operations in approximately 190 countries and territories approximately 30 of our 2016 net revenues were generated outside of the united states as a result we are subject to risks inherent in global operations these risks which can vary substantially by market are described in many of the risk factors discussed in this section and also includecompliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states including antibribery laws such as the fcpachanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws or their interpretation or tax audit implicationsthe imposition of increased or new tariffs quotas trade barriers or similar restrictions on our sales or regulations taxes or policies that might negatively affect our salescurrency devaluations or fluctuations in currency valuescompliance with antitrust and competition laws data privacy laws and a variety of other local national and multinational regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictionsdiscriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies in or across foreign jurisdictionschanges in capital controls including currency exchange controls government currency policies or other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product into various countries or repatriate cash from outside the united stateschanges in local regulations and laws the uncertainty of enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resourcesrisks and costs associated with political and economic instability corruption antiamerican sentiment and social and ethnic unrest in the countries in which we operatethe risks of operating in developing or emerging markets in which there are significant uncertainties regarding the interpretation application and enforceability of laws and regulations and the enforceability of contract rights and intellectual property rightsrisks arising from the significant and rapid fluctuations in currency exchange markets and the decisions and positions that we take to hedge such volatilitychanging labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operationsgreater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles anddesign implementation and use of effective control environment processes across our diverse operations and employee basein addition political and economic changes or volatility geopolitical regional conflicts terrorist activity political unrest civil strife acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations or customer demand slow economic growth or high unemployment in the markets in which we operate could constrain consumer spending and declining consumer purchasing power could adversely impact our profitability all of these factors could result in increased costs or decreased revenues and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and results of operations7we must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brandsin nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsour financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovationconsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsprolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or impact on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categoriesthe food and beverage industrys overall growth is generally linked to population growth our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsan impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating resultswe test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value 8fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deterioratean impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worthcommodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating resultswe purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products tomatoes cucumbers potatoes onions other fruits and vegetables spices flour and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins cardboard glass plastic metal paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as water and natural gas to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations furthermore the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultsalthough we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultswe rely on our management team and other key personnelwe depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin particular the success of the continued integration of kraft and heinz will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results9we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitivenesswe have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our integration program as defined below that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefits of our cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production and profitability could decreasechanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail customers could adversely affect our financial performanceretail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may consolidate resulting in fewer but larger customers for our business consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing more favorable terms increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsretail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin addition technologybased systems which give consumers the ability to shop through ecommerce websites and mobile commerce applications are also significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets if we are unable to adjust to developments in these changing landscapes we may be disadvantaged in key channels and with certain consumers which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultschanges in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact uswe have significant sales to certain significant customers there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsdisputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin addition the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control a significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategywe plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels consumer demand behavior taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectations10changes in laws and regulations could increase our costsour activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food and beverage production storage distribution sales and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsfederal state and local governments and administrative bodies within the us which represents a majority of our operations are considering a variety of broad tax trade and other regulatory reforms for example an increase in tariff or restrictive trade activities around the world could negatively impact our ability to succeed in certain markets similarly changes in tax laws such as tax reform in the united states or changes in tax laws resulting from the organization for economic cooperation and developments oecd multijurisdictional plan of action to address base erosion and profit sharing could impact our effective tax rate it is not currently possible to accurately determine the potential impact of these proposed or future changes but these changes could have a material impact on our businesslegal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penaltiesas a large food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating results in addition the costs and other effects of defending potential and pending litigation and administrative actions against us may be difficult to determine and could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results product recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect usselling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration misbranding tampering or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptionswe may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsunanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customerswe have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fire or explosion political unrest terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or comanufacturers operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results11the failure to integrate successfully the business and operations of kraft and heinz in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future resultswhile no material disruptions occurred during the first full year of integration there can be no assurances that the kraft and heinz businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses unexpected integration issues or higher than expected integration costs it is also possible that the overall postmerger integration process will take longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed as we continue to integrate the operations of kraft and heinz in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2015 mergercombining the companies operations and corporate functions combining the businesses of kraft and heinz and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the 2015 merger the failure of which could result in the material anticipated benefits of the 2015 merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating the companies technologies integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical kraft and heinz customers identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assetsharmonizing the companies operating practices employee development and compensation programs internal controls and other policies procedures and processesintegrating the companies financial reporting and internal control systems including our ability to maintain compliance with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended and the rules promulgated thereunder by the sec maintaining existing agreements with customers distributors providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers distributors providers and vendors addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies integrating and consolidating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer systems coordinating distribution and marketing efforts managing the movement of certain positions to different locations andcoordinating geographically dispersed organizations in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the integration of the businesses of kraft and heinz and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our businesswe may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint venturesfrom time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of managements attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances or joint ventures or other developments outside our core regions or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the fcpa currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results12our performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do businessour performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business such conditions and factors include changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in food and drug laws accounting standards and critical accounting estimates taxation requirements and environmental laws other factors impacting our operations in the united states venezuela russia and other international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our financial results for further information on venezuela see note 15 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation to the consolidated financial statementsvolatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our businesschanges in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidityour results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expensesinflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreementsfurthermore we may be subject to increased costs or experience adverse effects to our operating results if we are unable to renew collectively bargained agreements on satisfactory terms our financial condition and ability to meet the needs of our customers could be materially and adversely affected if strikes or work stoppages and interruptions occur as a result of delayed negotiations with unionrepresented employees both in and outside of the united statesvolatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net incomewe use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products coffee beans meat products wheat corn products soybean oils sugar and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income we report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we report these gains and losses in the unallocated corporate items line in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatments13our net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuationswe derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah and chinese renminbi since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe are significantly dependent on information technology and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption misappropriation of data or breaches of securitywe rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage invasions disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown by unintentional or malicious actions of employees and contractors or by cyberattacks and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions reputational damage transaction errors processing inefficiencies the leakage of confidential information and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayedin addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliersmisuse leakage or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations damage to the reputation and credibility of the company loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and therefore could have a negative impact on net operating revenues in addition we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us our current or former employees or to our suppliers or consumers and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight the company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systemsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandswe consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesswe may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products14our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers or regulators operatewe may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers and regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against certain business interruption risks we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chainour level of indebtedness could adversely affect our businesswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt the existing debt together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness couldlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures research and development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes result in a downgrade to our credit rating restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make nonstrategic divestitures limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions make it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness require a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities and in the case of any additional indebtedness exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leveragein addition our credit agreement and indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants will limit our ability to among other things incur or permit to exist certain liens or our ability to merge or consolidate with or into another company in each case with customary exceptions there can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future debt or equity financings will be available to us to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other needs as a result we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity there is no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on favorable terms or at all any inability to generate sufficient cash flow or to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditionthe creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default if we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments the creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation15the sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the futurethe sponsors own approximately 51 of our common stock six of our 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition some of our executive officers including bernardo hees our chief executive officer are partners of 3g capital one of the sponsors as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisionsfuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fallsales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securitieskraft heinz 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway entered into a registration rights agreement requiring us to register for resale under the securities act all registrable shares held by 3g global food holdings lp and berkshire hathaway which represents all shares of our common stock held by the sponsors as of the date of the closing of the 2015 merger as of the closing of the 2015 merger registrable shares represented approximately 51 of our outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis although the registrable shares are subject to certain holdback and suspension periods the registrable shares are not subject to a lockup or similar restriction under the registration rights agreement accordingly sales of a large number of registrable shares may be made upon registration of such shares with the sec in accordance with the terms of the registration rights agreement registration and sales of our common stock effected pursuant to the registration rights agreement will increase the number of shares being sold in the public market and may increase the volatility of the price of our common stockour ability to pay regular dividends to our shareholders is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and may be limited by our debt agreements limitations under delaware lawalthough it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends any such determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the board of directors and will be dependent on thenexisting conditions including our financial condition income legal requirements including limitations under delaware law and other factors the board of directors deems relevant the board of directors may in its sole discretion change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely for these reasons shareholders will not be able to rely on dividends to receive a return on investment accordingly realization of any gain on shares of our common stock may depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock which may never occurwe may not generate us earnings and profits sufficient for distributions paid to stockholders to be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposesin 2016distributions made on our stock including the redemption of 83 billion of our 900 cumulative compounding preferred stock series a series a preferred stock which we believe will be treated as a dividend distribution for us federal income tax purposes significantly exceeded our earnings and profits as determined under us tax principles and therefore only a portion of our regular 2016 quarterly dividends was treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes for purposes of us federal income tax insofar as our earnings and profits are not sufficient these distributions would be treated as a return of capital to each stockholder up to the extent of the stockholders tax basis if a stockholder does not have sufficient tax basis these distributions could result in taxable gains to the stockholder although it is currently anticipated that we will continue to pay regular quarterly dividends we cannot currently anticipate whether our future earnings and profits will be sufficient for all or a portion of future year distributions to be treated as dividends as determined under us tax principles stockholders should consult their tax advisors for a full understanding of all of the tax consequences of the receipt of dividends including distributions in excess of our earnings and profits16item 1b unresolved staff commentsnoneitem 2 properties our corporate coheadquarters are located in pittsburgh pennsylvania and chicago

revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factorsadvertising consumer incentives and trade promotions we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotionsadvertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses sgampa we recorded advertising expense of 708 million in 2016 464 million in 2015 and 241 million in 2014 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information 32goodwill and intangible assetsthe carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets was 974 billion at december 31 2016 and 989 billion at january 3 2016 these balances are largely attributable to asset valuations performed in connection with the 2013 merger and the 2015 merger see note 2 merger and acquisition and note 6 goodwill and intangible assets for additional informationwe test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 no impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test however we noted that one reporting unit within the europe segment had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of less than 10 the goodwill carrying value of this reporting unit was 48 million as of april 4 2016 our goodwill impairment testing date in addition there was no impairment of indefinitelived intangibles as a result of our testing however we noted that seven brands each had excess fair value over its carrying value of less than 10 these brands had an aggregate carrying value of 61 billion at april 4 2016 our indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing date of the 61 billion aggregate carrying value 56 billion was attributable to velveeta lunchables maxwell house and cracker barrelfair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deterioratepostemployment benefit planswe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and sgampa for our postretirement benefit plans our 2017 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 63 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2022 and 2027 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have had the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of december 31 2016 in millions onepercentagepoint increase decreaseeffect on annual service and interest cost6 5effect on postretirement benefit obligation74 63our 2017 discount rate assumption is 40 for service cost and 31 for interest cost for our postretirement plans our 2017 discount rate assumption is 43 for service cost and 36 for interest cost for our us pension plans and 32 for service cost and 23 for interest cost for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the plans changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryear33in 2016 we changed the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement benefit plans cost resulting in a decrease to these cost components we now use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we accounted for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimateour 2017 expected rate of return on plan assets is 57 for our us pension plans and 48 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit paymentswhile we do not anticipate further changes in the 2017 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basis point change in our discount rate or a 100basispoint change in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have had the following

tax rate based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating the uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheetswe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position we have a significant amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested we do not recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or which may be remitted tax free in certain situations we do recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvestedwe intend to continue to reinvest the majority of our foreign subsidiary earnings to support our priorities for growth in international markets and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations if we decided at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on the applicable us tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings we believe it is not practicable because there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact this uncertainty results from the significant judgment required to analyze the amount of foreign tax credits attributable to the earnings the ability to use foreign tax credits to offset the us tax on the earnings the potential timing of any distributions as well as the local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the potential distribution of these earnings34new accounting pronouncementssee note 1 background and basis of presentation to the consolidated

other current liabilities was driven primarily by increased payments in 2016 related to income taxesnet cash provided byused for investing activitiesnet cash used for investing activities was 11 billion in 2016 compared to 97 billion in 2015 the decrease in cash used for investing activities was driven by payments to acquire kraft in connection with the 2015 merger the decrease in cash used for investing activities was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures to 12 billion in 2016 which was primarily due to integration and restructuring activities in the united states we expect 2017 capital expenditures to be approximately 12 billion including capital expenditures required for our ongoing integration and restructuring activities cash used for investing activities also reflected lower proceeds from cash settlements of net investment hedges in 2016 than in 2015net cash provided byused for financing activitiesnet cash used for financing activities was 46 billion in 2016 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 102 billion in 2015 this decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by proceeds of 100 billion from our issuance of common stock to the sponsors in connection with the 2015 merger the series a preferred stock redemption in june 2016 and the impact of five common stock cash distributions in 2016 compared to two such cash distributions in 2015 the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by net proceeds from our longterm debt issuances in may 2016 and net proceeds from our issuance of commercial paper which were our primary sources of funding for the series a preferred stock redemption additionally in the prior year we had a benefit from proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt which were largely offset by repayments of longterm debt our cash used for financing activities in 2016 also reflected the impact of one cash distribution related to our series a preferred stock in 2016 compared to five such cash distributions in 2015 see equity and dividends within this item for further information on cash distributions related to common stock and series a preferred stock35cash flow activity for 2015 compared to 2014net cash provided byused for operating activitiescash provided by operating activities was 25 billion in 2015 compared to 21 billion in 2014 the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in operating income in 2015 as a result of the 2015 merger partially offset by an increase in pension contributions and working capital improvements that were less pronounced than 2014net cash provided byused for investing activitiesnet cash used in investing activities was 97 billion in 2015 compared to 349 million in 2014 the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by our payments to acquire kraft and also included proceeds from our net investment hedges of 488 million capital expenditures were 648 million in 2015net cash provided byused for financing activitiesnet cash provided by financing activities was 102 billion in 2015 compared to net cash used of 18 billion in 2014 the 102 billion of cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by 100 billion proceeds from issuance of common stock to the sponsors our cash provided by financing activities also included 148 billion proceeds from issuances of longterm debt partially offset by longterm debt repayments of 123 billion and the payment of our quarterly common stock cash dividend starting in the third quarter of 2015 additionally related to the series a preferred stock we made cash distributions of 900 million in 2015 which reflected five dividend payments compared to cash distributions of 720 million in 2014 which reflected four dividend paymentscash held by international subsidiariesat december 31 2016 approximately 13 billion of cash and cash equivalents were held by international subsidiaries we have provided for a deferred tax liability of 21 million for undistributed earnings not considered to be indefinitely reinvested we consider the unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed in the united states to be indefinitely reinvested for those undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested our intent is to reinvest these earnings in our international operations and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate the accumulated earnings to fund our united states cash requirements if we decide at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the united states we would be required to pay taxes on these amounts based on the applicable united states tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paidfurther certain previously taxed earnings have not yet been remitted and certain intercompany loans have not yet been repaid as a result in future periods we believe that we could remit approximately 28 billion of cash to the united states without incurring any additional material tax expense total debtin 2016 together with kraft heinz foods company we commenced a commercial paper program as of december 31 2016 we had 642 million of commercial paper outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 1074 during the year ended december 31 2016 the maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding was 12 billion we had no commercial paper outstanding at january 3 2016we maintain our senior credit facilities comprised of our 40 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility and a 600 million senior unsecured loan facility the term loan facility and together with the revolving credit facility the senior credit facilities subject to certain conditions we may increase the amount of revolving commitments andor add additional tranches of term loans in a combined aggregate amount of up to 10 billion our senior credit facilities contain customary representations covenants and events of default at december 31 2016 600 million aggregate principal amount of our term loan facility was outstanding no amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility at december 31 2016 at january 3 2016 or during the years ended december 31 2016 and january 3 2016 our longterm debt including the current portion was 318 billion at december 31 2016 and 252 billion at january 3 2016 the increase during the period was driven by new issuances of longterm debt during the second quarter of 2016 we used the net proceeds from these issuances primarily to redeem all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for 83 billion our longterm debt contains customary representations covenants and events of default and we were in compliance with all such covenants at december 31 2016see note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information36offbalance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual

obligations for materials supplies property plant and equipment and copacking storage and distribution services based on projected needs to be utilized in the normal course of business other purchase obligations include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction a few of these obligations are longterm and are based on minimum purchase requirements certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations we do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations we exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above e other longterm liabilities primarily consist of postretirement benefit commitments future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans through 2026 are expected to be 13 billion we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2026 certain longterm liabilities related to income taxes insurance accruals and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items during the second quarter of 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock therefore we no longer pay series a preferred stock dividends see note 12 capital stock to the consolidated financial statements for additional informationpension contributions were 344 million in 2016 we estimate that 2017 pension contributions will be approximately 150 million to our us plans and approximately 35 million to our nonus plans beyond 2017 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our contributions depend on many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates and other factors as such expected pension contributions for 2017 have been excluded from the above table at december 31 2016 the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 395 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if or when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of net unrecognized tax benefits from the above table37equity and dividendsseries a preferred stockon june 7 2016 we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock therefore we no longer pay series a preferred stock dividends prior to the redemption we made cash distributions of 180 million in 2016 compared to 900 million in 2015 and 720 million in 2014 our series a preferred stock entitled holders to a 900 annual dividend to be paid in four dividends in arrears on each march 7 june 7 september 7 and december 7 in cash in 2015 there were five dividend payments because concurrent with the declaration of our common stock dividend on december 8 2015 we also declared and paid the series a preferred stock dividend that would otherwise have been payable on march 7 2016 accordingly there were no cash distributions related to our series a preferred stock in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in only one dividend payment in 2016 prior to redemptionsee note 12 capital stock to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the series a preferred stockcommon stock dividendswe paid common stock dividends of 36 billion in 2016 and 13 billion in 2015 no common stock dividends were paid in 2014 additionally on february 15 2017 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 060 per share of common stock which is payable on march 17 2017 to shareholders of record on march 3 2017 the present annualized dividend rate is 240 per share of common stock the declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and

basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our underlying operations management believes that presenting our nongaap financial measures ie organic net sales adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps is useful to investors because it i provides investors with meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items ii permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget make operating and strategic decisions and evaluate historical performance and iii otherwise provides supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating our results we believe that the presentation of these nongaap financial measures when considered together with the corresponding us gaap financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosuresorganic net sales is defined as net sales excluding when they occur the impact of acquisitions currency divestitures and a 53rd week of

potentially adverse effects that volatility in these markets may have on our operating results we maintain risk management policies that principally use derivative financial instruments to reduce significant unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows that may arise from variations in commodity prices foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates see note 1 background and basis

companies to create a leading consumer goods company with a mission of longterm growth and sustainable living unilever declined the proposal on february 19 2017 we disclosed that we had amicably withdrawn our proposal for a combination of the two companieschange in fiscal year endon december 9 2016 our board of directors approved a change to our fiscal year end from sunday to saturday effective december 31 2016 we operate on a 52 or 53week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in december in each calendar year in prior years we operated on a 52 or 53week fiscal year ending the sunday closest to december 31 as a result we occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year our year ended january 3 2016 includes a 53rd week of activity this change to our fiscal year end aligns our financial statement reporting date with the fiscal close periods of certain of our us and canada businesses which make up a substantial portion of our results this change did not have a material impact on our current or any prior period financial statements  significant accounting policiesprinciples of consolidationthe consolidated financial statements include the kraft heinz company as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions are eliminated57use of estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap which requires us to make accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statementstranslation of foreign currenciesfor all significant foreign operations the functional currency is the local currency assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income for the periodhighly inflationary accountingwe apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a threeyear period meets or exceeds 100 percent under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net incomeloss rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange ratescash and cash equivalentscash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or lessinventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value inventories primarily using the average cost methodproperty plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years capitalized software costs are included in property plant and equipment and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the software which do not exceed seven years we review longlived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable such conditions include significant adverse changes in the business climate currentperiod operating or cash flow losses significant declines in forecasted operations or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposalgoodwill and intangible assetswe test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value58fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deterioratewe performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2016 see note 6 goodwill and intangible assets for additional information definitelived intangible assets are amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated periods benefited and are reviewed when appropriate for possible impairmentrevenue recognition we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factorsadvertising consumer incentives and trade promotionswe promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotionsadvertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses sgampa we recorded advertising expense of 708 million in 2016 464 million in 2015 and 241 million in 2014 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other informationconsumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other informationresearch and development expensewe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within sgampa research and development expense was approximately 120 million in 2016 105 million in 2015 and 58 million in 2014postemployment benefit planswe maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees these include pension benefits postretirement health care benefits and defined contribution benefits the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses in future periods within cost of products sold and sgampa financial instrumentsas we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results one way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments as a matter of policy we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposesderivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value which fluctuates based on changing market conditionscertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through earnings the effective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses and are recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings in the same line item as the underlying hedged item we also designate certain derivatives and nonderivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our nonderivatives designated as net investment 59hedges are calculated each period with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations the income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities all other cash flows related to derivative instruments are generally classified within operating activities for additional information on derivative activity within our operating results see note 14 financial instrumentsto qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period any hedging ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item we formally document our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items and method for assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in earnings in the current periodunrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded within the applicable segment operating resultswhen we use financial instruments we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement we are also exposed to market risk as the value of our financial instruments might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instrumentsforeign currency cash flow hedges  we use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from thirdparty and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the british pound sterling euro and canadian dollar these instruments include forward foreign exchange contracts substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment we exclude forward points from the assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and report such amounts in current period net income as interest expensenet investment hedges  we have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates we manage this risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative instruments including crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedgesinterest rate cash flow hedges  from time to time we have used derivative instruments including interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations substantially all of these derivative instruments have been highly effective and have qualified for hedge accounting treatmentcommodity derivatives  we are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials we enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for coffee beans meat products sugar wheat products corn products vegetable oils cocoa products and dairy products these commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception we also use commodity futures and options to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs including coffee beans meat products sugar wheat products corn products vegetable oils cocoa products dairy products diesel fuel and packaging products we do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposure60income taxeswe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between us gaap accounting and tax reporting we also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periodswe apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such changewe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial positioncommon stock and preferred stock dividendsdividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings when we have an accumulated deficit dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paidin capitalrecently issued accounting standardsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu that superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance under this asu companies will apply a principlesbased five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 the asu may be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective transition method with a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption while we are still evaluating the impact this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosures we have completed our preliminary scoping reviews and have made progress in our assessment phase we have focused our reviews on the revenue streams in the us canada and europe as they are our most significant at this time we believe the potential impacts on our existing accounting policies may be associated with our consumer incentive and trade promotion programs we will adopt the new standard on january 1 2018 however we are still evaluating our application method our ability to adopt using the full retrospective method is dependent on system readiness which may include software procured from thirdparty providers and finalizing our assessment of information necessary to restate prior period financial statementsin february 2016 the fasb issued an asu that superseded previously existing leasing guidance the asu is intended to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease the new guidance requires lessees to reflect most leases on their balance sheet as assets and obligations this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019 early adoption is permitted the new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition and provides for certain practical expedients based on our initial reviews we expect that the adoption will increase the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets we are still evaluating the impact this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosuresin march 2016 the fasb issued an asu intended to simplify equitybased award accounting and presentation the asu impacts income tax accounting related to equitybased awards the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and the classification on the statement of cash flows as a result of this asu our excess tax benefits upon the exercise of share based payments will be recognized in the tax provision rather than within equity which we expect to generate a favorable impact on our 2017 income tax expense in addition the cash flows related to employee tax withholdings on restricted share vesting will be reclassified from financing activities to operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows the impact of adopting this asu at december 31 2016 would have been a 30 million income tax benefit recorded on the consolidated statement of income and an offsetting noncash deduction in cash flows from operating activities on the statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2016 this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 201761in august 2016 the fasb issued an asu related to the classification of certain cash payments and cash receipts on the statement of cash flows this asu provides guidance on eight specific cash flow classification matters in order to reduce current and future diversity in practice the asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 early adoption is permitted the guidance related to each of the eight separate classification matters must be adopted in the same period using a retrospective transition method while we are still evaluating the impact that this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosures we currently expect one of these classification matters to impact us under the new guidance cash payments for debt prepayment and debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities we expect that this will result in a reclassification of call premiums paid in conjunction with our debt refinancing activity in 2015 from operating activities to financing activities in october 2016 the fasb issued an asu on the income tax accounting impacts of intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory such as intellectual property and property plant and equipment this guidance is intended to reduce the complexity and diversity in practice particularly for intellectual property transfers under the new accounting guidance current and deferred income taxes should be recognized upon transfer of the assets previously recognition of current and deferred income taxes was prohibited until the asset was sold to an external third party this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 early adoption is permitted but must be adopted in the first interim period of the annual period for which the asu is adopted the new guidance must be adopted on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the adoption period we are currently evaluating the impact that this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosuresin november 2016 the fasb issued an asu requiring the statement of cash flows to now explain the change in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in addition to cash and cash equivalents accordingly restricted cash would be required to be included in the beginning and ending cash and cash equivalents balances additionally this asu provides specific guidance on restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents cash flow classification and presentation matters in order to reduce current and future diversity in practice the asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period the new guidance must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented we are currently evaluating the impact that this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosuresin january of 2017 the fasb issued an asu intended to simplify how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating step 2 from the goodwill impairment test under the new guidance if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit previously if the fair value of a reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount step 1 an entity was required to calculate any impairment charge by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount step 2 additionally under the new standard entities that have reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will no longer be required to perform the qualitative assessment to determine whether to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test as a result reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts will generally be expected to pass the simplified impairment test however additional disclosure will be required of those entities this asu will be effective in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2020 early adoption is permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment testing dates after january 1 2017 the new guidance must be adopted on a prospective basis we are currently evaluating the impact that this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosuresnote 2 merger and

which are both variations of the income approach we used the excess earnings method for our most significant trademarks due to their impact on the cash flows of the business and used the relief from royalty method for the remaining trademarks and licenses for customer relationships we used the distributor method a variation of the excess earnings method that uses distributorbased inputs for margins and contributory asset chargessome of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinitelived or definitelived intangible asset including net sales cost of products sold selling and marketing costs and working capitalcontributory asset charges the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream the assessment of each assets life cycle and competitive trends as well as other factors we determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions estimated product category growth rates management plans and market comparables63we used carrying values as of july 2 2015 to value trade receivables and payables as well as certain other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items at the 2015 merger datewe valued finished goods and workinprocess inventory using a net realizable value approach which resulted in a stepup of 347 million that was recognized in cost of products sold in the period from the 2015 merger date to september 27 2015 as the related inventory was sold raw materials and packaging inventory was valued using the replacement cost approachwe valued property plant and

costs under us gaap these include severance and employee benefit costs and other exit costs severance and employee benefit costs primarily relate to cash severance noncash severance including accelerated equity award compensation expense and pension and other termination benefits other exit costs primarily relate to lease and contract terminations we also incur expenses that are an integral component of and directly attributable to our restructuring activities which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs under us gaap these include assetrelated costs and other incremental costs assetrelated costs primarily relate to accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges as well as costs to exit facilities relocation costs and startup costs of new facilities other implementation costs primarily relate to professional fees and other incremental thirdparty feesemployee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements local statutory requirements or historical benefit practices we recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with nonrecurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employees required future service period charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on longlived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale and those assets are written down to expected net realizable value if carrying value exceeds fair value all other costs are recognized as incurred64integration program following the 2015 merger we announced a multiyear program the integration program designed to reduce costs streamline and simplify our operating structure as well as optimize our production and supply chain network across our businesses in the united states and canada segments we expect to incur pretax costs of 20 billion related to the integration program with approximately 60 reflected in cost of products sold within our united states and canada segments these pretax costs are comprised of the following categoriesorganization costs 400 million associated with our plans to streamline and simplify our operating structure resulting in workforce reduction primarily severance and employee benefit costsfootprint costs 12 billion

assumed the assets and liabilities associated with these planswe remeasure our postemployment benefit plans at least annuallyin the first quarter of 2016 we changed the method that we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement costbenefit we use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates the change resulted in a decrease in service and interest cost of approximately 80 million in 2016 compared to what our costs would have been under the previous method this change did not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we have accounted for

our most significant program in place was the us securitization program which was amended in may 2016 and originally entered into in october of 2015 under the program we are entitled to receive cash consideration of up to 800 million which we elected to reduce to 500 million effective february 21 2017 and a receivable for the remainder of the purchase price the deferred purchase price this securitization program utilizes a bankruptcyremote specialpurpose entity spe the spe is whollyowned by a subsidiary of kraft heinz and its sole business consists of the purchase or acceptance through capital contributions of receivables and related assets from a kraft heinz subsidiary and subsequent transfer of such receivables and related assets to a bank although the spe is included in our consolidated financial statements it is a separate legal entity with separate creditors who will be entitled upon its liquidation to be satisfied out of the spes assets prior to any assets or value in the spe becoming available to kraft heinz or its subsidiaries the assets of the spe are not available to pay creditors of kraft heinz or its subsidiaries this program expires in may 2017in addition to the us securitization program we have accounts receivable factoring programs denominated in australian dollars new zealand dollars british pound sterling euros and japanese yen under these programs we generally receive cash consideration up to a certain limit and a receivable for the deferred purchase price there is no deferred purchase price associated with the japanese yen contract related to these programs our aggregate cash consideration limit after applying applicable holdbacks was 245 million us dollars at december 31 2016 generally each of these programs automatically renews annually

rate swaps total notional amount of 79 billion from hedging relationships in connection with the repayment of the term b1 and term b2 loans we determined that the related forecasted future cash flows

a subsidiary in venezuela that manufactures and sells a variety of products primarily in the condiments and sauces and infantnutrition categories we apply highly inflationary accounting to the results of our venezuelan subsidiary and include these results in our consolidated financial statements under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current net incomeloss rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until the venezuelan economy is no longer considered highly inflationary certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange ratesour results of operations in venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary we continue to have sufficient currency liquidity and pricing flexibility to run our operations however the continuing economic uncertainty strict labor laws and evolving government controls over imports prices currency exchange and payments present a challenging operating environment increased restrictions imposed by the venezuelan government or further deterioration of the economic environment could impact our ability to control our venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our venezuelan subsidiary in the futureat december 31 2016 there were two exchange rates legally available to us for converting venezuelan bolivars to us dollars including the official exchange rate of bsf10 per us dollar available through the sistema de divisa protegida dipro which is available for purchases and sales of essential items including food products andan alternative exchange rate available through the sistema de divisa complementaria dicom which is available for all transactions not covered by dipro and is a freefloating exchange rate format93the dicom rate formerly the marginal currency system simadi averaged bsf496 per us dollar in 2016 and was bsf674 per us dollar at december 31 2016 we have had access to us dollars at dicom rates in 2016 as of december 31 2016 we believe that the dicom rate is the most appropriate legally available rate at which to translate the results of our venezuelan subsidiarywe have had no settlements at the current official exchange rate of bsf10 per us dollar in 2016 we have had limited access to and settlements at the former official exchange rate of bsf630 per us dollar in 2016 as of march 10 2016 the official exchange rate was devalued to bsf10 per us dollar we had outstanding requests of 26 million at december 31 2016 for payment of invoices for the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years 2012 through 2015 all of which were requested for payment at bsf630 per us dollarthroughout 2016 we remeasured the net monetary assets and operating results of our venezuelan subsidiary resulting in a net nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of 24 million in 2016 which was recorded in other expenseincome net in the consolidated statement of income during the second quarter of 2016 the dicom rate deteriorated significantly from bsf276 per us dollar as of april 3 2016 to bsf628 per us dollar as of july 3 2016 accordingly as of july 3 2016 we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our venezuelan subsidiary for impairment resulting in a 53 million loss to write down property plant and equipment net and prepaid spare parts which was recorded within cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income for that period we continue to monitor the dicom rate and our nonmonetary assets being supported by the underlying operations in venezuela for impairment the currency has ranged between bsf628 and bsf676 per us dollar from july 3 2016 to december 31 2016 no triggers for impairment resulted from this movement in june 2015 due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty we reevaluated the rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary we determined that the dicom rate was the most appropriate legally available rate at june 28 2015 we remeasured the net monetary assets of our venezuelan subsidiary at the then dicom rate of bsf1977 per us dollar resulting in a nonmonetary currency devaluation loss of 234 million which was recorded in other expenseincome net in the consolidated statements of income for the second quarter of 2015 additionally we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our venezuelan subsidiary for impairment which resulted in a 49 million loss to write down inventory to the lower of cost or market which was recorded in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income for the second quarter of 2015 prior to june 28 2015 we used the official exchange rate of bsf630 per us dollar to translate the results of our venezuelan subsidiaryin 2014 we also had limited access to the complimentary system of foreign currency acquirement sicad ii foreign exchange mechanism which was eliminated in 2016 sicad ii was the market through which us dollars were to be obtained for the remittance of dividends this market had significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms at the time with published weighted average daily exchange rates of approximately bsf50 per us dollar in 2014 we converted 164 million bolivars into 3 million us dollars recognizing a 23 million transactional currency loss which was recorded in other expenseincome net in the consolidated statements of incomenote 16 commitments and contingencieslegal proceedingswe are routinely involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inquiries inspections or investigations legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business on april 1 2015 the commodity futures trading commission cftc filed a formal complaint against mondelēz international formerly known as kraft foods inc and kraft in the

international and kraft 1 manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011 2 violated position limit levels for wheat futures and 3 engaged in noncompetitive trades by trading both sides of exchangeforphysical chicago board of trade wheat contracts as previously disclosed by kraft these activities arose prior to the october 1 2012 spinoff of kraft by mondelēz international to its shareholders and involve the business now owned and operated by mondelēz international or its affiliates the separation and distribution agreement between kraft and mondelēz international dated as of september 27 2012 governs the allocation of liabilities between mondelēz international and kraft and accordingly mondelēz international will predominantly bear the costs of this matter and any monetary penalties or other payments that the cftc may impose we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business while we cannot predict with certainty the results of legal matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the legal matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 94leases rental expenses for leases of warehouse production and
