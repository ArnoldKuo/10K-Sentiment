we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts tomatoes potatoes soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products wheat and other goods to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins and cardboard to package our products and natural gas to operate our facilities for commodities that we use across many of our product categories such as corrugated paper and energy we coordinate sourcing 3requirements and centralize procurement to leverage our scale in addition some of our product lines and brands separately source raw materials that are specific to their operations we source these commodities from a variety of providers including large international producers and smaller local independent sellers where appropriate we seek to establish preferred purchaser status andor have developed strategic partnerships with many of our suppliers with the objective of achieving favorable pricing and dependable supply for many of our commodities the prices of raw materials and agricultural materials that we use in our products are affected by external factors such as global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programsthe most significant cost components of our cheese products are dairy commodities including milk and cheese we purchase our dairy raw material requirements from independent third parties such as agricultural cooperatives and independent processors market supply and demand as well as government programs significantly influence the prices for milk and other dairy products significant cost components in our meat business include pork beef and poultry which we primarily purchase from applicable local markets livestock feed costs and the global supply and demand for us meats influence the prices of these meat products the most significant cost component of our coffee products is coffee beans which we purchase on world markets quality and availability of supply currency fluctuations and consumer demand for coffee products impact coffee bean prices the most significant cost components in our nut products include peanuts cashews and almonds which we purchase on both domestic and world markets where global market supply and demand is the primary driver of price our risk management group works with our procurement teams to monitor worldwide supply and cost trends so we can obtain ingredients and packaging needed for production at competitive prices although the prices of our principal raw materials can be expected to fluctuate we believe there will be an adequate supply of the raw materials we use and that they are generally available from numerous sources our risk management group uses a range of hedging techniques in an effort to limit the impact of price fluctuations on many of our principal raw materials however we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw material costs we actively monitor any changes to commodity costs so that we can seek to mitigate the effect through pricing and other operational measurescompetitionwe face competition in all aspects of our business competitors include large national and international food and beverage companies and numerous local and regional companies we compete with both branded and generic products in addition to retailer brands wholesalers and cooperatives we compete primarily on the basis of product quality and innovation brand recognition and loyalty service the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences the introduction of new products and the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns and marketing programs distribution shelf space merchandising support and

retain liability we do not currently expect these to have a material effect on our earnings or financial conditionas of january 3 2016 we had accrued an amount we deemed appropriate for environmental remediation based on information currently available we believe that the ultimate resolution of existing environmental remediation actions and our compliance in general with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings or financial conditionhowever it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of future compliance efforts and environmental remedial actions and thus future costs associated with such matters may exceed current reservesforeign operationsfor the year ended january 3 2016 we generated a significant amount of our net sales

issuers including kraft heinz that are electronically filed with the secitem 1a risk factorswe operate in a highly competitive industrythe food and beverage industry is highly competitive across all of our product offerings we compete based on product innovation price product quality brand recognition and loyalty effectiveness of marketing and distribution promotional activity and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferenceswe may need to reduce our prices in response to competitive and customer pressures including changing consumer preferences that may adversely impact the market for our products these pressures may also restrict our ability to increase prices in response to commodity and other cost increases we may also need to increase or reallocate spending on marketing retail trade incentives materials advertising and new product innovation to maintain or increase market share these expenditures are subject to risks including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance of our efforts if we are unable to compete effectively our profitability financial condition and operating results may suffer7maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business successwe have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offeringswe seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing negative attention on the role of food and beverage marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about legal or regulatory action against us or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operationsin addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information including misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products or our suppliers and in some cases our competitors on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain extend and expand our reputation brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affectedwe must leverage our brand value to compete against retailer brands and other economy brandsin nearly all of our product categories we compete with branded products as well as retailer and other economy brands which are typically sold at lower prices our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers prefer retailer or other economy brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings a change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital marketing and other expenditures which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsthe consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect usretail customers such as supermarkets warehouse clubs and food distributors in our major markets may consolidate resulting in fewer customers for our business consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored product offerings in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsretail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance may have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsour financial success depends on our ability to correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand to offer new products to meet those changes and to respond to competitive innovationconsumer preferences for food and beverage products change continually our success depends on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to consumer preferences including with respect to health and wellness if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers our sales and market share will decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe must distinguish between shortterm fads midterm trends and longterm changes in consumer preferences if we do not accurately predict which shifts in consumer preferences will be longterm or if we fail to introduce new and improved products to satisfy those preferences our sales could decline in addition because of our varied consumer base we must offer an array of products that satisfy a broad spectrum of consumer preferences if we fail to expand our product offerings successfully across product categories or if we do not rapidly develop products in faster growing or more profitable categories demand for our products could decrease which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results8prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs we strive to respond to consumer preferences and social expectations but we may not be successful in our efforts continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin addition achieving growth depends on our successful development introduction and marketing of innovative new products and line extensions there are inherent risks associated with new product or packaging introductions including uncertainties about trade and consumer acceptance or impact on our existing product offerings we may be required to increase expenditures for new product development successful innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance to obtain protect and maintain necessary intellectual property rights and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others we must also be able to respond successfully to technological advances by and intellectual property rights of our competitors and failure to do so could compromise our competitive position and impact our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key product categories increase our market share or add products that are in faster growing and more profitable categoriesthe food and beverage industrys overall growth is generally linked to population growth our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key product categories and growth in the food and beverage industry in the countries in which we operate our future results will also depend on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products in faster growing and more profitable categories and our ability to increase market share in our existing product categories our failure to drive revenue growth limit market share decreases in our key product categories or develop innovative products for new and existing categories could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsan impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our consolidated operating resultswe test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2015 prior to completion of the 2015 merger  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate  an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets could negatively affect our operating results or net worth9commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and could negatively affect our consolidated operating resultswe purchase and use large quantities of commodities including dairy products meat products coffee beans nuts soybean and vegetable oils sugar and other sweeteners corn products tomatoes cucumbers potatoes onions other fruits and vegetables spices flour and wheat to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of resins cardboard glass plastic metal paper fiberboard and other materials to package our products and we use other inputs such as water and natural gas to operate our facilities we are also exposed to changes in oil prices which influence both our packaging and transportation costs prices for commodities energy and other supplies are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change crop failures or shortages due to plant disease or insect and other pest infestation consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy including increased demand for biofuels and agricultural programs additionally we may be unable to maintain favorable arrangements with respect to the costs of procuring raw materials packaging services and transporting products which could result in increased expenses and negatively affect our operations additionally the cost of raw materials and finished products may fluctuate due to movements in crosscurrency transaction rates rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultsalthough we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to hedge against input price increases to the extent we deem appropriate we do not fully hedge against changes in commodity prices and our hedging strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs for example hedging our costs for one of our key commodities dairy products is difficult because dairy futures markets are not as developed as many other commodities futures markets continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultswe rely on our management team and other key personnelwe depend on the skills working relationships and continued services of key personnel including our experienced management team in addition our ability to achieve our operating goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin particular the success of the continued integration of kraft and heinz will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teams attention may be diverted from successfully integrating kraft and heinz to hiring suitable replacements in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms all of which could adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from streamlining actions to reduce fixed costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitivenesswe have implemented a number of cost savings initiatives including our integration program that we believe are important to position our business for future success and growth we have evaluated changes to our organization structure to enable us to reduce costs simplify or improve processes and improve our competitiveness our future success may depend upon our ability to realize the benefit of our cost savings initiatives in addition certain of our initiatives may lead to increased costs in other aspects of our business such as increased conversion outsourcing or distribution costs we must be efficient in executing our plans to achieve cost savings and operate efficiently in the highly competitive food and beverage industry particularly in an environment of increased competitive activity to capitalize on our efforts we must carefully evaluate investments in our business and execute on those areas with the most potential return on investment if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from our efforts we could be cost disadvantaged in the marketplace and our competitiveness production and profitability could decrease10changes in our relationships with significant customers or suppliers could adversely impact uswe have significant sales to certain significant customers there can be no assurance that all of our significant customers will continue to purchase our products in the same mix or quantities or on the same terms as in the past particularly as increasingly powerful retailers may demand lower pricing and focus on developing their own brands the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales or a change in the mix of products we sell to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsdisputes with significant suppliers including disputes related to pricing or performance could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsin addition the financial condition of such customers and suppliers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control a significant deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers and suppliers could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultswe may not be able to successfully execute our international expansion strategywe plan to drive additional growth and profitability through international distribution channels consumer demand behavior taste and purchasing trends may differ in international markets and as a result our sales may not be successful or meet expectations or the margins on those sales may be less than currently anticipated we may also face difficulties integrating foreign business operations with our current sourcing distribution information technology systems and other operations any of these challenges could hinder our success in new markets or new distribution channels there can be no assurance that we will successfully complete any planned international expansion or that any new business will be profitable or meet our expectationschanges in laws and regulations could increase our costsour activities throughout the world are highly regulated and subject to government oversight various laws and regulations govern food and beverage production storage distribution sales and marketing as well as licensing trade tax and environmental matters governing bodies regularly issue new regulations and changes to existing regulations our need to comply with new or revised regulations or their interpretation and application could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultslegal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penaltiesas a large food and beverage company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating resultsproduct recalls or other product liability claims could materially and adversely affect usselling products for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks including product contamination spoilage product tampering allergens or other adulteration we could decide to or be required to recall products due to suspected or confirmed product contamination adulteration misbranding tampering or other deficiencies product recalls or market withdrawals could result in significant losses due to their costs the destruction of product inventory and lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time we could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products or ingredients or the food safety system generally adverse attention about these types of concerns whether or not valid may damage our reputation discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptionswe may also suffer losses if our products or operations violate applicable laws or regulations or if our products cause injury illness or death in addition our marketing could face claims of false or deceptive advertising or other criticism a significant product liability or other legal judgment or a related regulatory enforcement action against us or a significant product recall may materially and adversely affect our reputation and profitability moreover even if a product liability or fraud claim is unsuccessful has no merit or is not pursued the negative publicity surrounding assertions against our products or processes could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results11unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customerswe have a complex network of suppliers owned manufacturing locations comanufacturing locations distribution networks and information systems that support our ability to consistently provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control such as weather raw material shortages natural disasters fire or explosion terrorism generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations or our suppliers or comanufacturers operations these disruptions may require additional resources to restore our supply chain or distribution network if we cannot respond to disruptions in our operations whether by finding alternative suppliers or replacing capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or if we are unable to quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers and may also be unable to track orders inventory receivables and payables if that occurs our customers confidence in us and longterm demand for our products could decline any of these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsthe failure to integrate successfully the business and operations of kraft and heinz in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future resultsprior to the 2015 merger kraft and heinz operated as independent companies there can be no assurances that these businesses can be integrated successfully it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key historical kraft or heinz employees the loss of customers the disruption of ongoing businesses unexpected integration issues or higher than expected integration costs it is also possible that the overall postmerger integration process will take longer than originally anticipated specifically the following issues among others must be addressed as we continue to integrate the operations of kraft and heinz in order to realize the anticipated benefits of the 2015 mergercombining the companies operations and corporate functions combining the businesses of kraft and heinz and meeting the capital requirements of the combined company in a manner that permits us to achieve the cost savings anticipated to result from the 2015 merger the failure of which could result in the material anticipated benefits of the 2015 merger not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating the companies technologies integrating and unifying the offerings and services available to historical kraft and heinz customers identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming functions and assetsharmonizing the companies operating practices employee development and compensation programs internal controls and other policies procedures and processes integrating the companies financial reporting and internal control systems including our ability to become compliant with the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as amended and the rules promulgated thereunder by the sec maintaining existing agreements with customers distributors providers and vendors and avoiding delays in entering into new agreements with prospective customers distributors providers and vendors addressing possible differences in business backgrounds corporate cultures and management philosophies integrating and consolidating the companies administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer systems coordinating distribution and marketing efforts managing the movement of certain positions to different locations andcoordinating geographically dispersed organizations in addition at times the attention of certain members of our management may be focused on the integration of the businesses of kraft and heinz and diverted from daytoday business operations which may disrupt our business12we may not successfully identify or complete strategic acquisitions alliances divestitures or joint venturesfrom time to time we may evaluate acquisition candidates alliances or joint ventures that may strategically fit our business objectives or we may consider divesting businesses that do not meet our strategic objectives or growth or profitability targets these activities may present financial managerial and operational risks including but not limited to diversion of managements attention from existing core businesses difficulties integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems inability to effectively and immediately implement control environment processes across a diverse employee population adverse effects on existing or acquired customer and supplier business relationships and potential disputes with buyers sellers or partners activities in such areas are regulated by numerous antitrust and competition laws in the united states the european union and other jurisdictions and we may be required to obtain the approval of acquisition and joint venture transactions by competition authorities as well as to satisfy other legal requirements in addition to the extent we undertake acquisitions alliances or joint ventures or other developments outside our core geography or in new categories we may face additional risks related to such developments for example risks related to foreign operations include compliance with us laws affecting operations outside of the united states such as the foreign corrupt practices act currency rate fluctuations compliance with foreign regulations and laws including tax laws and exposure to politically and economically volatile developing markets any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating resultsour performance may be adversely affected by economic and political conditions in the united states and in various other nations where we do businessour performance has been in the past and may continue in the future to be impacted by economic and political conditions in the united states and in other nations where we do business such conditions and factors include changes in applicable laws and regulations including changes in food and drug laws accounting standards and critical accounting estimates taxation requirements and environmental laws other factors impacting our operations in the united states venezuela russia and other international locations where we do business include export and import restrictions currency exchange rates currency devaluation cash repatriation restrictions recessionary conditions foreign ownership restrictions nationalization the impact of hyperinflationary environments terrorist acts and political unrest such factors in either domestic or foreign jurisdictions could materially and adversely affect our financial results for further information on venezuela see note 17 venezuela  foreign currency and inflation to the consolidated financial statementsvolatility of capital markets or macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our businesschanges in financial and capital markets including market disruptions limited liquidity and interest rate volatility may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt in addition our borrowing costs can be affected by short and longterm ratings assigned by rating organizations a decrease in these ratings could limit our access to capital markets and increase our borrowing costs which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultssome of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged consolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers some of which are highly leveraged and facing increased competition and continued credit market volatility these factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk a significant adverse change in the financial andor credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables this could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension labor and peoplerelated expensesinflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the united states canada and other foreign jurisdictions including pension health and welfare and severance benefits any declines in market returns could adversely impact the funding of pension plans the assets of which are invested in a diversified portfolio of equity and fixedincome securities and other investments additionally the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreementsvolatility in the market value of all or a portion of the derivatives we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices may cause volatility in our operating results and net incomewe use commodity futures and options to partially hedge the price of certain input costs including dairy products coffee beans meat products wheat corn products soybean oils sugar and natural gas changes in the values of these derivatives are currently recorded in net income resulting in volatility in both gross profits and net income we report these gains and losses in cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of income to the extent we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process we report these gains and losses in the unallocated corporate items line in our segment operating results until we sell the underlying 13products at which time we reclassify the gains and losses to segment operating results we may experience volatile earnings as a result of these accounting treatmentsour net sales and net income may be exposed to exchange rate fluctuationswe derive a substantial portion of our net sales from international operations we hold assets and incur liabilities earn revenue and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the us dollar primarily the british pound sterling euro australian dollar canadian dollar new zealand dollar brazilian real indonesian rupiah and chinese renminbi since our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars fluctuations in exchange rates from period to period will have an impact on our reported results we have implemented currency hedges intended to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates however these hedging strategies may not be successful and any of our unhedged foreign exchange exposures will continue to be subject to market fluctuations in addition in certain circumstances we may incur costs in one currency related to services or products for which we are paid in a different currency as a result factors associated with international operations including changes in foreign currency exchange rates could significantly affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe are significantly dependent on information technologywe rely on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic and financial information to manage a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory legal and tax requirements we also depend on our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations personnel customers and suppliers these information technology systems some of which are managed by third parties may be susceptible to damage disruptions or shutdowns due to hardware failures computer viruses hacker attacks and other cybersecurity risks telecommunication failures user errors catastrophic events or other factors if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience business disruptions transaction errors processing inefficiencies and the loss of customers and sales causing our product sales financial condition and operating results to be adversely affected and the reporting of our financial results to be delayedin addition if we are unable to prevent security breaches or disclosure of nonpublic information we may suffer financial and reputational damage litigation or remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners customers consumers or suppliersour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brandswe consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our patents trade secrets copyrights and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuses of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our technology or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesswe may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technology brands or products any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products14our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we or our customers suppliers or regulators operatewe may be impacted by severe weather and other geological events including hurricanes earthquakes floods or tsunamis that could disrupt our operations or the operations of our customers suppliers and regulators natural disasters or other disruptions at any of our facilities or our suppliers facilities may impair or delay the delivery of our products influenza or other pandemics could disrupt production of our products reduce demand for certain of our products or disrupt the marketplace in the foodservice or retail environment with consequent material adverse effects on our results of operations while we insure against certain business interruption risks we cannot provide any assurance that such insurance will compensate us for any losses incurred as a result of natural or other disasters to the extent we are unable to or cannot financially mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events or effectively manage such events if they occur particularly when a product is sourced from a single location there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and additional resources could be required to restore our supply chainour indebtedness levels could impact our businessour ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness including any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations financings or asset sales our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control we may not generate sufficient funds to service our debt and meet our business needs such as funding working capital or the expansion of our operations if we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due we may be forced to take disadvantageous actions including reducing spending on marketing retail trade incentives advertising and product innovation reducing financing in the future for working capital capital expenditures and general corporate purposes selling assets or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness the creditors who hold our debt could also accelerate amounts due in the event that we default which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of the maturity of our other debt if our operating performance declines we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required creditors under our indebtedness instruments to avoid being in default if we breach the covenants under our indebtedness instruments and seek a waiver we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required creditors if this occurs we would be in default under our indebtedness instruments the creditors could exercise their rights as described above and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidationour indebtedness could also impair our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures or general corporate purposes especially if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward in addition our leverage could put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to lessleveraged competitors that could have greater financial flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and secure additional financing for their operations our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the food and beverage industry could be impaired making us more vulnerable in the event of a general downturn in economic conditions in our industry or in our businessour level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and make strategic acquisitions limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our existing indebtednesswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and are permitted to incur a substantial amount of additional indebtedness including secured debt the existing debt together with the incurrence of additional indebtedness could have important consequences for example our indebtedness couldlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures research and development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes result in a downgrade to our credit rating restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make nonstrategic divestitures limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions make it more difficult for us to make payments on our existing indebtedness require a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities and 15in the case of any additional indebtedness exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leveragein addition the credit agreement and indentures governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants will limit our ability to among other things incur or permit to exist certain liens or merge or consolidate with or into another company in each case with customary exceptionsthe terms of our series a preferred stock provide for a 900 annual dividend payment of which could adversely affect our results of operations and could result in a net lossthe terms of our series a preferred stock provide for a 900 annual dividend these dividend payments resulted in a net loss attributable to kraft heinzs common shareholders in our fiscal year ended january 3 2016 despite having otherwise generated 634 million in net income during that period to the extent dividend payments to holders of the 900 series a cumulative redeemable preferred stock series a preferred stock exceed our net income before taking into account such payments in any fiscal year a net loss would result even if such dividend payments do not exceed our net income the payment obligation will have a negative impact on our results of operations in addition the ability to pay these dividend payments is also subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control while we currently intend to refinance the series a preferred stock in 2016 there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully undertake such refinancingthe sponsors have substantial control over us and may have conflicts of interest with us in the futurethe sponsors together with employees who were heinz stockholders prior to the consummation of the 2015 merger own approximately 51 of our common stock six of our 11 directors had been directors of heinz prior to the closing of the 2015 merger and remained directors of kraft heinz pursuant to the merger agreement in addition some of our executive officers including bernardo hees our chief executive officer are partners of 3g capital one of the sponsors as a result the sponsors have the potential to exercise influence over management and have substantial control over decisions of our board of directors as well as over any action requiring the approval of the holders of our common stock including adopting any amendments to our charter electing directors and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of our capital stock or our assets in addition to the extent that the sponsors collectively hold a majority of our common stock they together would have the power to take shareholder action by written consent to adopt amendments to our charter or take other actions such as corporate transactions that require the vote of holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock the directors designated by the sponsors may have significant authority to effect decisions affecting our capital structure including the issuance of additional capital stock incurrence of additional indebtedness the implementation of stock repurchase programs and the decision of whether or not to declare dividends additionally the sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us the sponsors may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and as a result those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us so long as the sponsors continue to own a significant amount of our equity they will continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control our decisionsfuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause volatility in the price of our common stock or cause the share price to fallsales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity

continue to pay regular quarterly dividends our earnings as determined under us tax principles may not be sufficient for all or a portion of these distributions to be treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes if our earnings and profits are not sufficient these distributions would be treated as a return of capital to each shareholder up to the extent of the shareholders tax

prior year we compare our year ended december 28 2014 to the 2013 successor period and the unaudited predecessor period from december 24 2012 through june 7 2013 we believe this is the most appropriate way to compare our full year 2014 results to a comparable prior year period all data for the unaudited predecessor period december 24 2012 to june 7 2013 is derived from our unaudited

our multiyear 19 billion integration program which we announced following the 2015 merger the costs primarily include organization costs including cash and noncash severance footprint costs to exit facilities and other costs incurred as a direct result of restructuring activities related to the 2015 merger additionally we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately 11 billion related to the integration program and have recognized 225 million in the year ended january 3 2016 the integration program is designed to reduce costs integrate and optimize our combined organization and is expected to achieve 15 billion of pretax savings by 2017 primarily benefiting the united states and canada segments we realized approximately 125 million of pretax savings in the year ended january 3 2016 these expenses also include costs associated with other restructuring activities focused primarily on workforce reductions and factory closures and consolidations in relation to the 2013

to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors  advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions  advertising expenses are recorded in selling general and administrative expenses sgampa we recorded advertising expense of 464 million in the year ended january 3 2016 241 million in the year ended december 28 2014 190 million in the 2013 successor period 22 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 305 million in fiscal 2013 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information  consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information  goodwill and intangible assetsas a result of the 2013 merger and the 2015 merger the carrying value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets is substantial as of january 3 2016 431 billion of goodwill and 558 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets as more fully described in note 7 goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements valuations attributed to the 2015 merger 290 billion goodwill and 451 billion indefinitelived intangible assets are preliminary and potentially subject to change we test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2015 prior to completion of the 2015 merger  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value no impairment of goodwill was reported as a result of our 2015 or 2014 annual goodwill impairment tests however the historical heinz north america consumer products reporting unit had an estimated fair value in excess of its carrying value of less than 10 as a result of our annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests we recognized noncash impairment losses of 58 million in the year ended january 3 2016 and 221 million in the year ended december 28 2014fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased 31discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate  postemployment benefit planswe provide a range of benefits to our eligible employees and retirees these include defined benefit pension postretirement benefit plans defined contribution and multiemployer pension and medical benefits we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets in future periods within cost of sales and sgampafor our postretirement benefit plans our 2016 health care cost trend rate assumption will be 65 we established this rate based upon our most recent experience as well as our expectation for health care trend rates going forward we anticipate the weighted average assumed ultimate trend rate will be 49 the year in which the ultimate trend rate is reached varies by plan ranging between the years 2016 and 2024 assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans a onepercentagepoint change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost and obligation as of january 3 2016 onepercentagepoint increase

discount rate assumption is 43 for our us pension plans and 38 for our nonus pension plans we model these discount rates using a portfolio of high quality fixedincome debt instruments with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the benefit obligations changes in our discount rates were primarily the result of changes in bond yields yearoveryearbeginning in 2016 we will change the method we use to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of net pension costbenefit and net postretirement benefit plans cost resulting in a decrease to these cost components we will use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows previously we estimated service cost and interest cost using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period we are making this change to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates this change will not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we will account for this change prospectively as a change in accounting estimateour 2016 expected rate of return on plan assets is 57 for our us pension plans and 58 for our nonus pension plans we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets from the plan assets historical longterm investment performance current and future asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset class we attempt to maintain our target asset allocation by rebalancing between asset classes as we make contributions and monthly benefit paymentswhile we do not anticipate further changes in the 2016 assumptions for our us and nonus pension and postretirement benefit plans as a sensitivity measure a 100basis point change in our discount rate or a 100basis point change in the actual rate of return on plan assets would have the following effects increasedecrease in cost as of

tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we earn income significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating 32uncertainty of our tax positions we recognize a benefit for tax positions that we believe will more likely than not be sustained upon examination the amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that we believe has more than a 50 probability of being realized upon settlement we regularly monitor our tax positions and adjust the amount of recognized tax benefit based on our evaluation of information that has become available since the end of our last financial reporting period the annual tax rate includes the impact of these changes in recognized tax benefits when adjusting the amount of recognized tax benefits we do not consider information that has become available after the balance sheet date however we do disclose the effects of new information whenever those effects would be material to our financial statements unrecognized tax benefits represent the difference between the amount of benefit taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting these unrecognized tax benefits are recorded primarily within other liabilities on the balance sheetwe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position we have a significant amount of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested we do not recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested or which may be remitted tax free in certain situations we do recognize us taxes on undistributed earnings in foreign subsidiaries which are currently not considered to be indefinitely reinvestedwe intend to continue to reinvest the majority of our foreign subsidiary earnings to support our priorities for growth in international markets and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations if we decided at a later date to repatriate these funds to the us we would be required to provide taxes on these amounts based on the applicable us tax rates net of credits for foreign taxes already paid it is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability associated with the indefinitely reinvested undistributed earnings we believe it is not practicable because there is a significant amount of uncertainty with respect to the tax impact this uncertainty results from the significant judgment required to analyze the amount of foreign tax credits attributable to the earnings the ability to use foreign tax credits to offset the us tax on the earnings the potential timing of any distributions as well as the local withholding tax and other indirect tax consequences that may arise due to the potential distribution of these earnings new accounting pronouncementssee note 1 background and basis of presentation to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new

subsidiaries continue to be indefinitely reinvested and would not be available for use in the united states without incurring united states federal and state income tax consequences we also made taxable distributions of earnings in in the year ended december 28 2014 and in the 2013 predecessor period we did not have significant taxable distributions of foreign earnings in the 2013 successor period or for fiscal 2013 for the distributions of earnings in the year ended december 28 2014 we incurred tax expense of approximately 64 million the 2014 distributions used the majority of our united states foreign tax credit carry forwards in the 2013 predecessor period our taxable distributions of earnings resulted in a charge to our provision for income taxes of approximately 100 million we were able to use existing foreign tax credit carryforwards to offset the tax liability created by this distribution and therefore there were not incremental cash taxes incurred total debtour longterm debt increased to 252 billion at january 3 2016 as compared to 134 billion at december 28 2014 see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements for information on our debt including

include commitments for marketing advertising capital expenditures information technology and professional services arrangements are considered purchase obligations if a contract specifies all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased a pricing structure and approximate timing of the transaction a few of these obligations are longterm and are based on minimum purchase requirements certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments are expected to fluctuate based on changes in these variable components due to the proprietary nature of some of our materials and processes certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early terminations we do not believe that a material amount of penalties is reasonably likely to be incurred under these contracts based upon historical experience and current expectations we exclude amounts reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued liabilities from the table above eberkshire hathaway has an 80 billion preferred stock investment in kraft heinz which entitles it to a 900 annual dividend to be paid quarterly in cash or inkind we currently intend to refinance the series a preferred stock in 2016 however there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully undertake such refinancing and as such we have reflected continued quarterly cash distributions in all periods presented in the table above see note 13 preferred stock and warrants to the consolidated financial statements for additional informationf other longterm liabilities primarily consist of certain specific incentive compensation arrangements and postretirement benefit commitments future benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans through 2025 are expected to be 14 billion we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of the payments beyond 2025 longterm liabilities related to income taxes insurance accruals and other accruals included on the consolidated balance sheet are excluded from the above table as we are unable to estimate the timing of payments for these items pension contributions were 286 million for the year ended january 3 2016 we estimate that 2016 pension contributions will be approximately 315 million to our us plans and approximately 30 million to our nonus plans our us contributions include approximately 160 million in the first quarter of 2016 related to the termination of our us nonqualified pension plan that was effective december 31 2015 beyond 2016 we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of contributions to our pension plans our contributions depend on many factors including changes in tax employee benefit or other laws tax deductibility significant differences between expected and actual pension asset performance or interest rates and other factors as such expected pension contributions for 2016 have been excluded from the above table at january 3 2016 the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions including an accrual of related interest and penalties along with positions only impacting the timing of tax benefits was approximately 397 million the timing of payments will depend on the progress of examinations with tax authorities we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations within the next year we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to when any significant cash settlements with taxing authorities may occur therefore we have excluded the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits from the above table37equity and dividendsseries a preferred stockour series a preferred stock entitles holders to a 900 annual dividend to be paid quarterly in arrears on each march 7 june 7 september 7 and december 7 in cash while the series a preferred stock remains outstanding if we declare or pay a dividend on our common stock we must also declare and pay in full the dividend on the series a preferred stock for the thencurrent quarterly period we made cash distributions of 900 million during the year ended january 3 2016 which reflects five payments due to the fact that in connection with the declaration of our dividend on our common stock on december 8 2015 we also declared and paid the dividend on the series a preferred stock for the quarterly period that ends march 7 2016 we expect to continue to make cash distributions to pay this dividend as long as the series a preferred stock remains outstanding we made cash distributions of 720 million in the year ended december 28 2014 and 360 million in the 2013 successor period the series a preferred stock was issued in connection with the 2013 merger and therefore there were no preferred dividends paid in any of the predecessor periodssee note 13 preferred stock and warrants to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the series a preferred stockcommon stock dividendswe paid common stock dividends of 13 billion in the year ended january 3 2016 no common stock dividends were paid in the year ended december 28 2014 the 2013 successor period or the 2013 predecessor period we paid common stock dividends of 666 million in fiscal 2013 on december 8 2015 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0575 per share of common stock which was paid on january 15 2016 to shareholders of record on december 23 2015 in connection with this dividend we recorded 762 million of dividends payable as of january 3 2016 additionally on february 25 2016 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0575 per share of common stock which is payable on april 8 2016 to shareholders of record on march 18 2016 the present annualized dividend rate is 230 per share of common stock the

2013 the first business day of our 2014 fiscal yearconsistent with internal management reporting there are no pro forma adjustments in any of the 2013 periods presented as it would be impracticable to develop adjustments that would be meaningful the information would not be meaningful due to the difficulty of interpreting these pro forma impacts on the various durations of the multiple 2013 periods presented as well as the length of time that has passed since 2013 makes it difficult to assess how the company would have performed if kraft and heinz had been a combined company at that timeour pro

2015 we made the following changes in accounting and reporting to harmonize our accounting and reporting as kraft heinz we made a voluntary change in accounting policy to classify certain warehouse and distribution costs including shipping and handling costs associated with the distribution of finished product to our customers as cost of products sold which were previously recorded in selling general and administrative expenses sgampa we made this voluntary change in accounting policy because we believe this presentation is preferable as the classification in cost of products sold better reflects the cost of producing and distributing products additionally this presentation enhances the comparability of our financial statements with industry peers and aligns with how we now internally manage and review costs as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the change has been reflected in the consolidated statements of income through retrospective application of the change in accounting policy the impact of this change was to increase cost of products sold and decrease sgampa by 666 million for the year ended december 28 2014 367 million in the 2013 successor period 66 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 656 million in fiscal 2013 63we made a voluntary change in accounting policy to classify our trademark and license intangible asset impairments and amortization in sgampa which were previously recorded in cost of products sold we made this voluntary change in accounting policy because we believe this presentation is preferable as removing these expenses from cost of products sold better aligns cost of products sold with costs directly associated with generating revenue additionally this presentation enhances the comparability of our financial statements with industry peers and aligns with how we now internally manage and review costs as required by us gaap the change has been reflected in the consolidated statements of income through retrospective application of the change in accounting policy the impact of this change was to increase sgampa and decrease cost of products sold by 244 million for the year ended december 28 2014 11 million in the 2013 successor period 2 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 13 million in fiscal 2013 in 2015 we determined that we had previously misclassified customer related intangible asset amortization such costs were previously included in cost of products sold but should have been included in sgampa we have revised the classification to report these expenses in sgampa in the consolidated statements of income for all prior periods presented the impact of this revision was to increase sgampa and decrease cost of products sold by 68 million for the year ended december 28 2014 36 million in the 2013 successor period 1 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 18 million in fiscal 2013 these misstatements were not material to our current or any prior period financial statementswe separately presented sold receivables on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows to align with current period presentation  we revised our other assets longterm accrued postemployment costs longterm and other liabilities longterm on our 2014 consolidated balance sheet to correct for a prior period classification error and to correct for the misclassification of other assets to accrued postemployment costs longterm this correction resulted in an increase of 36 million to other assets an increase of 43 million to accrued postemployment costs longterm and a decrease of 7 million to other liabilities longterm this misstatement was not material to our current or any prior period financial statementsin 2015 we determined that we had misstated foreign currency translation gains and losses on goodwill from the date of the 2013 merger through december 28 2014 as well as deferred taxes recognized on the 2013 merger opening balance sheet in 2015 we recorded outofperiod corrections to reduce goodwill by 40 million reduce deferred tax assets by 11 million and reduce accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses by 51 million these misstatements were not material to our current or any prior period financial statementssignificant accounting policiesprinciples of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the kraft heinz company as well as our whollyowned and majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions are eliminated our year end date for financial reporting purposes is the sunday closest to december 31 as a result we occasionally have a 53rd week in a fiscal year our year ended january 3 2016 includes a 53rd week of activity the year end date of certain of our us and canada businesses is the saturday closest to december 31 use of estimateswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap which requires us to make accounting policy elections estimates and assumptions that affect a number of amounts in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable if actual amounts differ from estimates we include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period the actual amounts become known historically the aggregate differences if any between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial statementstranslation of foreign currencies for all significant foreign operations the functional currency is the local currency assets and liabilities of these operations are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period end income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net income for the period 64highly inflationary accounting we apply highly inflationary accounting if the cumulative inflation rate in an economy for a threeyear period meets or exceeds 100 percent under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of a subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars and exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in net income rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until such time as the economy is no longer considered highly inflationary certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates cash and cash equivalentscash equivalents include demand deposits with banks and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or lessinventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or market we value inventories primarily using the average cost methodproperty plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment are stated at historical cost and depreciated on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods ranging from 3 to 20 years and buildings and improvements over periods up to 40 years capitalized software costs are included in property plant and equipment and amortized on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the software which do not exceed seven years we review longlived assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable such conditions include significant adverse changes in the business climate currentperiod operating or cash flow losses significant declines in forecasted operations or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life we perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists when testing for impairment of assets held for use we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable if an impairment is determined to exist the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value impairment losses on assets to be disposed of if any are based on the estimated proceeds to be received less costs of disposalgoodwill and intangible assetswe test goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment at least annually in the second quarter or when a triggering event occurs we performed our annual impairment testing in the second quarter of 2015 prior to completion of the 2015 merger  the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the reporting units estimated fair value with its carrying value if the carrying value of a reporting units net assets exceeds its fair value the second step would be applied to measure the difference between the carrying value and implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the goodwill would be considered impaired and would be reduced to its implied fair value we test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of each intangible asset with its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds fair value the intangible asset would be considered impaired and would be reduced to fair value fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions estimates and market factors estimating the fair value of individual reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans as well as industry and economic conditions these assumptions and estimates include projected revenues and income growth rates terminal growth rates competitive and consumer trends marketbased discount rates and other market factors if current expectations of future growth rates are not met or market factors outside of our control such as discount rates change significantly then one or more reporting units or intangible assets might become impaired in the future additionally as goodwill and intangible assets associated with recently acquired businesses are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated acquisition date fair values those amounts are more susceptible to an impairment risk if business operating results or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate   revenue recognition we recognize revenues when title and risk of loss pass to our customers we record revenues net of consumer incentives and trade promotions and include all shipping and handling charges billed to customers we also record provisions for estimated product returns and customer allowances as reductions to revenues within the same period that the revenue is recognized we base these estimates principally on historical and current period experience factors  advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions we promote our products with advertising consumer incentives and trade promotions  65advertising expenses are recorded in sgampa we recorded advertising expense of 464 million in the year ended january 3 2016 241 million in the year ended december 28 2014 190 million in the 2013 successor period 22 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 305 million in fiscal 2013 for interim reporting purposes we charge advertising to operations as a percentage of estimated full year sales activity and marketing costs we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information  consumer incentives and trade promotions include but are not limited to discounts coupons rebates instore display incentives and volumebased incentives consumer incentive and trade promotion activities are recorded as a reduction to revenues based on amounts estimated as being due to customers and consumers at the end of a period we base these estimates principally on historical utilization and redemption rates we review and adjust these estimates each quarter based on actual experience and other information  research and development expensewe expense costs as incurred for product research and development within sgampa research and development expense was 105 million in the year ended january 3 2016 58 million in the year ended december 28 2014 53 million in the 2013 successor period 10 million in the 2013 predecessor period and 93 million in fiscal 2013  postemployment benefit planswe provide a range of benefits to our eligible employees and retirees these include defined benefit pension postretirement benefit plans defined contribution and multiemployer pension and medical benefits we maintain various retirement plans for the majority of our employees the cost of these plans is charged to expense over the working life of the covered employees we generally amortize net actuarial gains or losses and changes in the fair value of plan assets in future periods within cost of products sold and sgampafinancial instrumentsas we source our commodities on global markets and periodically enter into financing or other arrangements abroad we use a variety of risk management strategies and financial instruments to manage commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks our risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of these markets may have on our operating results one way we do this is through actively hedging our risks through the use of derivative instruments as a matter of policy we do not use highly leveraged derivative instruments nor do we use financial instruments for speculative purposesderivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value which fluctuates based on changing market conditionscertain derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment while others are not designated as hedging instruments and are marked to market through earnings the effective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses and are recognized in earnings at the time the hedged item affects earnings in the same line item as the underlying hedged item we also designate certain derivatives and nonderivatives as net investment hedges to hedge the net assets of certain foreign subsidiaries which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates the fair value of these derivatives and remeasurements of our nonderivatives designated as net investment hedges are calculated each period with changes reported in foreign currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses such amounts will remain in accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses until the complete or substantially complete liquidation of our investment in the underlying foreign operations the income statement classification of gains and losses related to derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments is determined based on the underlying intent of the contracts cash flows related to the settlement of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are classified in the consolidated statements of cash flows within investing activities all other cash flows related to derivative instruments are generally classified within operating activities for additional information on derivative activity within our operating results see note 16 financial instrumentsto qualify for hedge accounting a specified level of hedging effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged must be achieved at inception and maintained throughout the hedged period any hedging ineffectiveness is recognized in net earnings when the change in the value of the hedge does not offset the change in the value of the underlying hedged item we formally document our risk management objectives strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions the nature of and relationships between the hedging instruments and hedged items and method for assessing hedge effectiveness additionally for qualified hedges of forecasted transactions we specifically identify the significant characteristics and expected terms of the forecasted transactions if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur the hedge will no longer be effective and all of the derivative gains or losses would be recognized in earnings in the current periodunrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded within the applicable segment operating results66when we use financial instruments we are exposed to credit risk that a counterparty might fail to fulfill its performance obligations under the terms of our agreement we minimize our credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings limiting the amount of exposure we have with each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of our counterparties we also maintain a policy of requiring that all significant nonexchange traded derivative contracts with a duration of greater than one year be governed by an international swaps and derivatives association master agreement we are also exposed to market risk as the value of our financial instruments might be adversely affected by a change in foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices or interest rates we manage market risk by incorporating monitoring parameters within our risk management strategy that limit the types of derivative instruments and derivative strategies we use and the degree of market risk that we hedge with derivative instrumentsforeign currency cash flow hedges  we use various financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to changes in exchange rates from thirdparty and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions our principal foreign currency exposures that are hedged include the british pound sterling euro and canadian dollar these instruments may include forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options substantially all of these derivative instruments are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting treatment we exclude forward points from the assessment and measurement of hedge ineffectiveness and report such amounts in current period net income as interest expensenet investment hedges  we have numerous investments in our foreign subsidiaries the net assets of which are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates we manage this risk by utilizing derivative and nonderivative instruments including crosscurrency swap contracts and certain foreign denominated debt designated as net investment hedgesinterest rate cash flow hedges  from time to time we have used derivative instruments including interest rate swaps as part of our interest rate risk management strategy we have primarily used interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of interest payment cash flows on a portion of our future debt obligations substantially all of these derivative instruments have been highly effective and have qualified for hedge accounting treatmentcommodity derivatives  we are exposed to price risk related to forecasted purchases of certain commodities that we primarily use as raw materials we enter into commodity purchase contracts primarily for coffee beans meat products sugar wheat products corn products vegetable oils cocoa products and dairy products these commodity purchase contracts generally are not subject to the accounting requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities under the normal purchases exception we also use commodity futures and options to economically hedge the price of certain commodity costs including coffee beans meat products sugar wheat products corn products vegetable oils cocoa products dairy products diesel fuel and packaging products we do not designate these commodity contracts as hedging instruments we also sell commodity futures to unprice future purchase commitments and we occasionally use related futures to economically cross hedge a commodity exposureincome taxeswe recognize income taxes based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and record deferred tax assets or liabilities for any difference between us gaap accounting and tax reporting we also recognize deferred tax assets for temporary differences operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes realization of certain deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periodswe apply a morelikelythannot threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions accordingly we recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement future changes in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will affect income in the quarter of such changewe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized when assessing the need for valuation allowances we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs along with a corresponding increase or charge to income the resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position common stock and preferred stock dividendsdividends are recorded as a reduction to retained earnings when we have an accumulated deficit dividends are recorded as a reduction of additional paidin capital67recently issued accounting standardsin may 2014 the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu that superseded previously existing revenue recognition guidance under this asu an entity will apply a principlesbased five step model to recognize revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers and in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu will be effective beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2018 we are currently evaluating the impact that this asu will have on our financial statements and related disclosuresin april 2015 the fasb issued an asu intended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs the asu requires that debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt consistent with debt discounts the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this asu we earlyadopted this asu in 2015 and accordingly reclassified unamortized debt issuance costs of 228 million from other assets to longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at december 28 2014in september 2015 the fasb issued an asu intended to simplify the accounting for measurement period adjustments in a business combination measurement period adjustments are changes to provisional amounts recorded when the accounting for a business combination is incomplete as of the end of a reporting period the measurement period can extend for up to a year following the transaction date during the measurement period companies may make adjustments to provisional amounts when information necessary to complete the measurement is received the asu requires companies to recognize these adjustments including any related impacts to net income in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined companies are no longer required to retroactively apply measurement period adjustments to all periods presented we earlyadopted this asu in 2015 see note 2 merger and acquisition for additional information on measurement period adjustmentsin november 2015 the fasb issued an asu intended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes the asu requires that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet previously companies were required to classify deferred tax liabilities and assets as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related asset or liability we early adopted this asu 2015 on a prospective basis as the impact to prior periods was not significantnote 2 merger and acquisition2015

liabilities assumed our purchase price allocation is substantially complete with the exception of identifiable intangible assets certain income tax accounts and goodwill during our fourth quarter 2015 we made measurement period adjustments to reflect facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date these adjustments included a 54 billion increase in indefinitelived trademarks a related 20 billion increase in deferred tax liabilities and a 34 billion decrease in goodwill in addition we reflected a correction to our third quarter foreign currency exchange rate assumptions impacting foreign currency translation and goodwill by approximately 100 million this misstatement was not material to our current or any prior period financial statements as we continue to integrate kraft businesses we may obtain additional information on the acquired identifiable intangible assets which if significant could require revisions to preliminary valuation assumptions estimates and resulting fair values amounts for certain income tax accounts are also subject to change pending the filing of krafts preacquisition tax returns and the receipt of information from taxing authorities which if significant could require revisions to preliminary assumptions and estimates if we determine any measurement period adjustments are significant we will recognize those adjustments including

trademarks and licenses for customer relationships we used the distributor method a variation of the excess earnings method that uses distributorbased inputs for margins and contributory asset charges69some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinitelived or definitelived intangible asset including net sales cost of products sold selling and marketing costs and working capitalcontributory asset charges the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash

2013 we acquired an additional 15 interest in coniexpress sa industrias alimenticias coniexpress a leading brazilian manufacturer of the quero brand of tomatobased sauces tomato paste ketchup condiments and vegetables for 80 million prior to this transaction we owned 80 of coniexpress see note 18 commitments and contingencies for further details regarding this redeemable noncontrolling interest in the 2011 fiscal year we acquired foodstar holding pte foodstar a manufacturer of soy sauces and fermented bean curd in china which included a potential earnout payment contingent upon certain net sales and ebitda targets during fiscal 2013 and the 2014 fiscal year during fiscal 2013 we renegotiated the terms of the earnout agreement to obtain future flexibility for growing our business in china resulting in a cash settlement of the earnout for 60 million including a 12 million charge for the difference between the settlement amount and the carrying value of the earnout as reported on our balance sheet at the date of this transactionnote 3 integration and restructuring expensesfollowing the 2015 merger we announced a multiyear program the integration program designed to reduce costs integrate and optimize the combined organization as part of these activities we incur expenses primarily employee separations lease terminations and other direct exit costs that qualify as exit and disposal costs under us gaap we also incur expenses that are an integral component of and directly attributable to our restructuring activities which do not qualify as exit and disposal costs primarily accelerated depreciation asset impairments implementation costs such as new facility relocation and startup costs and other incremental costs employee severance and other termination benefit packages are primarily determined based on established benefit arrangements local statutory requirements or historical benefit practices we recognize the contractual component of these benefits when payment is probable and estimable additional elements of severance and termination benefits associated with nonrecurring benefits are recognized ratably over each employees required future service period assetrelated costs consist primarily of accelerated depreciation and to a lesser degree asset impairments charges for accelerated depreciation are recognized on longlived assets that will be taken out of service before the end of their normal service in which case depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over its shortened useful life asset impairments establish a new fair value basis for assets held for disposal or sale and those assets are written down to expected net realizable if carrying value exceeds fair value all other costs are recognized as incurredintegration program we currently expect the integration program will result in 19 billion of pretax costs with approximately 60 reflected in cost of products sold comprised of the following categories organization costs 650 million associated with our plans to streamline and simplify our operating structure resulting in workforce reduction these costs will primarily include severance and employee benefits cash severance noncash severance including accelerated equity award compensation expense and pension and other termination benefits 73beginning in august 2015 we announced a new streamlined structure for our businesses in the united states and canada segments this resulted in the reduction of salaried positions across the united states and canada we currently expect to eliminate 2650 positions footprint costs 11 billion associated with our plans to optimize our production and supply chain network resulting in facility closures and consolidations these costs will primarily include assetrelated costs accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges costs to exit facilities relocation and startup costs of new facilities and severance and employee benefits on november 4 2015 we announced the closure of seven factories and began consolidation of our distribution network in a staged process over the next 12 to 24 months production in these locations will shift to other existing factories in the united states and canada overall we expect to eliminate 2600 positions other costs 150 million incurred as a direct result of restructuring activities primarily including contract and lease terminations professional fees and other incremental thirdparty fees for the year ended january 3 2016 we have incurred 829 million of costs under the integration program including 562 million of severance and employee benefit costs 136 million of noncash assetrelated costs 76 million of other implementation costs and 55 million of other exit costs we expect approximately 60 of the integration program expenses will be cash expenditures at january 3 2016 the total integration program liability related primarily to the elimination of general salaried and footprintrelated positions across the united states and canada 2500 of whom have left the company by january 3 2016 the liability balance associated with the integration program which

the tax benefit for the 2013 successor period included a benefit related to the impact on deferred taxes of a 300 basis point statutory rate reduction in the united kingdom the benefits of these statutory rate reductions in the united kingdom were favorably impacted by the increase in deferred tax liabilities recorded in purchase accounting in the 2013 merger the tax provision for the june 7 2013 predecessor period was principally caused by the effect of repatriation costs of approximately 100 million for earnings of foreign subsidiaries distributed during the period and the effect of

target asset allocation and estimates of future longterm returns by asset classplan assetsthe underlying basis of the investment strategy of our defined benefit plans is to ensure that pension funds are available to meet the plans benefit obligations when they are due our investment objectives include investing plan assets in a highquality diversified manner in order to maintain the security of the funds achieving an optimal return on plan assets within specified risk tolerances and investing according to local regulations and requirements specific to each country in which a defined benefit plan operates the investment strategy expects equity investments to yield a higher return over the long term than fixedincome securities while fixedincome securities are expected to provide certain matching characteristics to the plans benefit payment cash flow requirements our investment policy specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the applicable plan asset allocation

primarily in the condiments and sauces and infantnutrition categories we apply highly inflationary accounting to our business in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting the financial statements of our venezuelan subsidiary are remeasured into our reporting currency us dollars based on the legally available exchange rate at which we expect to settle the underlying transactions exchange gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are reflected in current net income rather than accumulated other comprehensive incomelosses on the balance sheet until the venezuelan economy is no longer considered highly inflationary certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are recorded at the applicable historical exchange rates there are currently three exchange rates legally available to us for converting venezuelan bolivars to us dollars includingthe official exchange rate of bsf630 per us dollar which is available through the governmentoperated national center of foreign commerce cencoex and is applicable to import activities related to certain necessities including food productsthe complimentary system of foreign currency acquirement sicad i rate of approximately bsf12 per us dollar which operates similar to an auction system and allows entities in specific sectors to bid for us dollars to be used for specified import transactions andthe marginal currency system simadi rate which has averaged approximately bsf198 per us dollar since commencement of trading and is an openmarket exchange format that allows for legal trading of foreign currency based upon supply and demand108prior to february 2015 a fourth foreign exchange market mechanism sicad ii was available to us sicad ii became effective on march 24 2014 and was the market through which us dollars were to be obtained for the remittance of dividends this market had significantly higher foreign exchange rates than those available through the other foreign exchange mechanisms with published weighted average daily exchange rates of approximately bsf50 per us dollar during 2014 we had limited access to the sicad ii market mechanism and converted 164 million bolivars into 3 million us dollars recognizing a 23 million transactional currency loss which was recorded in other expenseincome net in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 28 2014 in february 2015 the sicad i and sicad ii foreign currency exchange systems were merged thereafter called sicad the published exchange rate for the sicad mechanism continues to be approximately bsf12 per us dollar we have had limited access to and settlements at the current official exchange rate of bsf630 per us dollar during the year ended january 3 2016 we had 26 million of outstanding requests at january 3 2016 for payment of invoices for the purchase of ingredients and packaging materials for the years from 2012 through 2015 subsequent to january 3 2016 we have received approvals for payment of invoices at bsf630 of approximately 2 million until june 2015 we had determined that the official cencoex rate of bsf630 per us dollar was the most appropriate rate to use for remeasurementin june 2015 due to the continued lack of liquidity and increasing economic uncertainty we reevaluated the rate used to remeasure the monetary assets and liabilities of our venezuelan subsidiary as of june 28 2015 we determined that the then simadi rate of bsf1977 per us dollar was the most appropriate legally available rate and remeasured our net monetary assets of our venezuelan subsidiary resulting in a nonmonetary currency devaluation of 234 million recorded in other expenseincome net in the consolidated statements of income during the second quarter of 2015 additionally we assessed the nonmonetary assets of our venezuelan subsidiary for impairment which resulted in a 49 million loss to write down inventory to the lower of cost or market which was recorded in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income during the second quarter of 2015 as of january 3 2016 we continue to believe that the simadi rate is the most appropriate legally available rate prior to the devaluation our venezuelan subsidiary had recognized net sales of 352 million and operating income of 51 million for the first half of 2015 as a result of the devaluation it recognized net sales of 10 million and had an operating loss of 8 million for the second half of 2015 our results of operations in venezuela reflect a controlled subsidiary however the continuing economic uncertainty strict labor laws and evolving government controls over imports prices currency exchange and payments present a challenging operating environment increased restrictions imposed by the venezuelan government could impact our ability to control our venezuelan operations and could lead us to deconsolidate our venezuelan subsidiary in the futureon february 18 2016 the venezuelan government announced two changes to its exchange controls i an official exchange rate change from bsf630 per us dollar to bsf10 per us dollar and ii a transition of simadi from openmarket exchange format to freefloating format in which exchange rates will fluctuate based on supply and demand we do not expect these changes to have a significant impact on our venezuelan resultsnote 18 commitments and contingencieslegal proceedingswe are routinely involved in legal proceedings claims and governmental inquiries inspections or investigations legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business  on april 1 2015 the commodity futures trading commission cftc filed a formal complaint against mondelēz international and kraft in the us district court for the northern district of illinois eastern division related to activities involving the trading of december 2011 wheat futures contracts the complaint alleges that mondelēz international and kraft 1 manipulated or attempted to manipulate the wheat markets during the fall of 2011 2 violated position limit levels for wheat futures and 3 engaged in noncompetitive trades by trading both sides of exchangeforphysical chicago board of trade wheat contracts as previously disclosed by kraft these activities arose prior to the october 1 2012 spinoff of kraft by mondelēz international to its shareholders and involve the business now owned and operated by mondelēz international or its affiliates the separation and distribution agreement between kraft and mondelēz international dated as of september 27 2012 governs the allocation of liabilities between mondelēz international and kraft and accordingly mondelēz international will predominantly bear the costs of this matter and any monetary penalties or other payments that the cftc may impose we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or business  as previously disclosed six lawsuits were filed in connection with the 2015 merger against kraft members of its board of directors heinz kite merger sub corp and kite merger sub llc the plaintiffs in these matters alleged among other things that i the form s4 contained material omissions and misleading statements and ii the members of the kraft board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the 2015 merger the plaintiffs sought among other things injunctive relief and damages as disclosed in krafts form 8k filed on june 24 2015 on june 23 2015 kraft entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs providing for the settlement of all of these lawsuits on october 28 2015 we executed a stipulation of settlement 109with the plaintiffs formalizing the terms of the memorandum of understanding on november 10 2015 the us district court for the eastern district of virginia issued an order preliminarily approving the settlement and providing for notice to krafts shareholders regarding the proposed settlement on february 18 2016 the court held a hearing regarding the proposed settlement the court indicated that it intends to approve the settlement and requested that plaintiffs counsel provide certain additional information we do not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations while we cannot predict with certainty the results of legal matters in which we are currently involved or may in the future be involved we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve any of the legal matters that are currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations leases rental expenses for leases of warehouse production and office facilities and equipment were 160 million for the year ended january 3 2016 102

brazilian subsidiary coniexpress has the right at any time to exercise a put option that would require us to purchase their equity interest at a redemption value determinable from a specified formula based on a multiple of ebitda subject to a fixed minimum linked to the original acquisition date value we also have a call right on this noncontrolling interest exercisable at any time and subject to the same redemption price the put and call options cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interest and the combination of a noncontrolling interest and the redemption feature require classification of the minority partners interest as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets in fiscal 2013 the minority partner exercised their put option for 15 of their initial 20 equity interest retaining 5 an adjustment was made to retained earnings to record the carrying value at the maximum redemption value immediately prior to this transaction as this exercise did not result in a change in control of coniexpress it was accounted for as an equity transaction in addition the amount of cumulative translation adjustment previously allocated to the redeemable noncontrolling interest was adjusted to reflect the change in ownership any subsequent change in maximum redemption value will be adjusted through retained earnings the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest approximates its maximum redemption value of the remaining 5 equity interest at january 3 2016 we do not currently believe the exercise of the put option would materially impact our results of operations or financial condition110note 19 earnings per shareas a result of the stock conversion prior to the 2015 merger all historical successor period per share

defined by geographic region united states canada and europe our remaining businesses are combined and disclosed as rest of world rest of world is comprised of three operating segments asia pacific latin america and russia india the middle east and africa rimea we began to report on our reorganized segment structure during the third quarter of 2015 and have reflected this structure for all historical periods presented  management evaluates segment performance based on several factors including net sales and segment adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization segment adjusted ebitda management uses segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources segment adjusted ebitda assists management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decisionmaking by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations these items include depreciation and amortization including amortization of postretirement benefit plans prior service credits equity award compensation expense integration and restructuring expenses merger costs unrealized gains and losses on commodity hedges the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in general corporate expenses until realized once realized the gains and losses are recorded in the applicable segment operating results impairment losses gainloss associated with the sale of a business nonmonetary currency devaluation and certain general corporate expenses in addition consistent with the manner in which management evaluates segment performance and allocates resources segment adjusted ebitda includes the operating results of kraft on a pro forma basis as if kraft had been acquired as of december 30 2013 there are no pro forma adjustments to any of the numbers disclosed in this note to the consolidated financial statements except for the segment adjusted ebitda reconciliationconsistent with internal management reporting there are no pro forma adjustments in any of the 2013 periods presented as it would be impracticable to develop adjustments that would be meaningful the information would not be meaningful due to the difficulty of interpreting these pro forma impacts on the various durations of the multiple 2013 periods presented as well as the length of time that has passed since 2013 makes it difficult to assess how the company would have performed if kraft and heinz had been a combined company at that timemanagement does not use assets by segment to evaluate performance or
