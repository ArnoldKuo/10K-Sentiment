companies have contributed sourcing and supply chain expertise to the 5050 joint venture and have committed to source generic pharmaceuticals through arrangements negotiated by it red oak sourcing will negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts on behalf of both companies but will not own products or hold inventory on behalf of either company we are required to pay 39 quarterly payments of 256 million to cvs commencing in october 2014 and only if certain milestones are achieved to pay additional predetermined amounts to cvs beginning in fiscal 2016 the  fixed payments of 256 million will be expensed evenly commencing with the rampup of the venture which we expect to begin by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015 no physical assets were contributed by either company to red

allowance for doubtful accounts of 137 million and 134 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date in accordance with contract terms we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due we continuously monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses which are based primarily on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountswe provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest were 158 million

in the consolidated balance sheets finance notes receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 18 million and 17 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountsconcentrations of credit riskwe maintain cash depository accounts with major banks and we invest in high quality shortterm liquid instruments and in marketable securities our shortterm liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses investments in marketable securities consist of a portfolio of highgrade instruments such investments are made only in instruments issued by highlyrated institutions whose financial condition we monitor31table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedour trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base including its wide geographic dispersion we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and maintain reserves for credit losses historically such losses have been within our expectationsmajor customersthe following table summarizes all of our customers that individually account for at least 10 percent of revenue and their corresponding percent of gross

organizations gpos which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 17 percent 13 percent and 13 percent of revenue for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangementsinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 61 percent and 65 percent at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation  if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2014 or 2013 inventories valued at lifo were 98 million and 97 million higher than the average cost value at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2014 and 2013 our remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 44 million and 40 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand

equipmentproperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amountsduring fiscal 2013 as a result of the reductions in the anticipated future cash flows in our nuclear pharmacy services division as discussed in note 5 we also performed recoverability testing for the longlived assets of this division which consist primarily of leasehold improvements machinery and equipment based on the assessment performed we determined that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are recoverabledepreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets including capital lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases we generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories buildings and improvements3 to 39 years machinery and equipment3 to 20 years and furniture and fixtures3 to 7 years we recorded depreciation expense of 265 million 269 million and 243 million for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 32table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated

are expensed as incurred interest on longterm projects is capitalized using a rate that approximates the weightedaverage interest rate on longterm obligations which was 368 percent at june 30 2014 the amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presentedbusiness combinationsthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trade names and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assetspurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks trade names and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful livesgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an  operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwillwe have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division home division and home divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 12 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and 33table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedassumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment as discussed further in note 5 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assetinvestmentsinvestments in nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for under either the cost or equity method of accounting and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets for investments in which we can exercise significant influence we use the equity method of accounting and our share of the earnings and losses which was immaterial both individually and in the aggregate for all periods presented is recorded in other income net in the consolidated statements of the earnings we monitor investments for otherthantemporary impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditionsduring fiscal 2014 we sold our minority equity interests in two investments for proceeds of 47 million which resulted in a pretax gain of 32 million 20 million net of tax included in other income net in the consolidated statements of earningsalso during fiscal 2014 we purchased marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities net of applicable taxes are included within shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci we monitor these securities for otherthantemporary impairment by considering factors such as the duration that and the extent to which the fair value is below cost the operating performance and credit worthiness of the issuer of the securities and current economic and market conditions see note 6 for additional information regarding availableforsale securities we previously held 72 million of investments in fixed income corporate debt securities which were classified as heldtomaturity and matured during fiscal 2013vendor reservesin the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the claim types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment all adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold in addition the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies vendor reserves were 82 million and 66 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively excluding thirdparty returns see separate section in note 1 for a description of thirdparty returnsvendor incentivesfees for services and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory represent product discounts and are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings upon sale of the related inventoryloss contingencieswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 9 for additional information regarding loss contingenciesincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions 34table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedin which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings are permanently reinvestedtax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 for additional information regarding income taxesother accrued liabilitiesother accrued liabilities represent various current obligations including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payablesharebased compensationsharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using a lattice valuation model the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the compensation expense recognized for sharebased awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards we classify sharebased compensation expense in distribution selling general and administrative sgampa expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees if awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity the incremental sharebased compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance see note 16 for additional information regarding sharebased compensationdividendswe paid cash dividends per common share of 121 1025 and 086 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyrevenue recognitionwe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured pharmaceutical segmentthe pharmaceutical segment recognizes distribution revenue when title transfers to its customers and we have no further obligation to provide services related to such merchandise revenue for deliveries that are directly shipped to customer warehouses from the manufacturer when we act as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of products is recorded gross this is in accordance with accounting standards addressing reporting revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent this revenue is recorded on a gross basis since we incur credit risk from the customer bear the risk of loss for incomplete shipments and do not receive a separate fee or commission for the transaction and as such are the primary obligor revenue from these sales is recognized

that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value or returned to vendors for credit merchantable product product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customereffective june 30 2013 we updated our policy to accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends margin rates and processing costs this prospective change did not have a material effect on consolidated revenue cost of products sold or operating earnings at june 30 2014 and 2013 the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was 273 million and 291 million respectively the impact of which is reflected in trade receivables net and inventories net in the consolidated balance sheets prior to this change in policy we recognized sales returns as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost respectively when products were returned amounts recorded in revenue and cost of products sold under our prior accounting policy closely approximated what would have been

product returns from our customers many of our customers return nonmerchantable pharmaceutical products to our vendors through third parties since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with our vendors our vendors pass the value of the returns to us usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction we in turn pass the value received less an administrative fee to our customer in certain instances we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to processing the deduction with our vendors although we believe we have satisfactory protections we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers we have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolutiondistribution service agreement and other vendor feesour pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from its distribution service agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendors inventory we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees and as such a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is

focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants a threetier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values arelevel 1 observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 2 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant

noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings this impairment charge did not impact our liquidity cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenantsas a result of significant softness in the lowenergy diagnostics market we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for our nuclear pharmacy services division during the three months ended december 31 2012 and determined that there was no impairment as the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of its carrying amount during the second half of fiscal 2013 we experienced sustained volume declines and  price erosion for the core lowenergy products provided by this division in addition we experienced reduced sales for some existing highenergy diagnostic products slowerthanexpected adoption of new highenergy diagnostic products and reimbursement developments that could have adversely impacted the future growth of these products using this information we adjusted our outlook and longterm business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unitwe completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2013 which we perform annually in the fourth quarter in conjunction with the preparation of our fiscal 2013 consolidated financial statements using a combination of the incomebased approach using a discount rate of 10 percent and the marketbased approach the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated to be below the carrying amount and therefore indicated impairment the second step of the

valuation allowance at june 30 2014 applies to certain federal state and international loss carryforwards that in our opinion are more likely than not to expire unutilized however to the extent that tax benefits related to these carryforwards are realized in the future the reduction in the valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense we had 510 million 650 million and 654 million of unrecognized tax benefits at june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 balances include 322 million 371 million and 337 million respectively of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would have an impact on the effective tax rate the remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty as to the timing of such deductibility recognition of these tax benefits would not affect our effective tax rate we include the full amount of unrecognized tax benefits in deferred

intellectual property matters government contract compliance matters disputes regarding environmental cleanup costs claims in connection with acquisitions and divestitures and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in such matterswe may be named from time to time in qui tam actions which are cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments that allege that false claims have been submitted or have been caused to be submitted for payment by the government after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in the matter these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determinationin addition we occasionally may suspect that products we manufacture market or distribute do not meet product specifications published standards or regulatory requirements in such circumstances we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such actions can lead to product recalls costs to repair or replace affected products temporary interruptions in product sales and action by regulatorswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters described below since damages or fines have not been specified or the proceedings are at stages where significant uncertainty exists as to legal or factual issues and as to whether such matters will proceed to trial we do not believe based on currently available information that the outcomes of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows though the outcome of one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations for a particular periodwe recognize income

licensing agreements and other agreements such indemnification 45table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedobligations vary in scope and when defined in duration in many cases a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated where appropriate such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability historically we have not individually or in the aggregate made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts in certain circumstances we believe that existing insurance arrangements subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations in addition we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not significantfrom time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business generally the obligation is capped at an explicit amount 11 fair value measurementsthe following tables present the fair values for those assets measured on a recurring basis at june 30 2014in millionslevel 1 level 2 level 3 totalcash
