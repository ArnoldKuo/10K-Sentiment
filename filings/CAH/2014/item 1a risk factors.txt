proceedings for instance some of the products that we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims our medical segments manufacturing businesses operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation patent litigation is costly to defend and can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments
