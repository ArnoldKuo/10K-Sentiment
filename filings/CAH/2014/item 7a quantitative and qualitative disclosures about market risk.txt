notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent financial accounting standardscritical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimatescritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsallowance for doubtful accountstrade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 137 million and 134 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 18 million and 17 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accountsthe allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risksour methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe19table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesfinancial review continuedthe following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful

the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables and finance notes receivables at june 30 2014 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 6 millionwe believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2014 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenueinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 61 percent and 65 percent at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products soldthe lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in first out method or market if we had used the average  cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2014 or 2013 primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have declined over time inventories valued at lifo were 98 million and 97 million higher than the average cost value at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2014 and 2013inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 44 million and 40 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be requiredbusiness combinationsthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assetspurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful lives20table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesfinancial review continuedgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our home division and home divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 12 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of  reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013 if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 as discussed further in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assetvendor reservesin the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was madevendor reserves were 82 million and 66 million at june 30 2014 and 2013 respectively approximately 68 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2014 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 60 percent at the end of fiscal 2013 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations 21table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesfinancial review continuedof outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptciesthe ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstancesloss contingencieswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding loss contingenciesprovision for income taxesour income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be

allowance primarily relates to federal state and international loss carryforwards for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after applying the valuation allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described abovewe believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accrued tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefitsif any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective income tax rate by 1 percent would have caused income tax expense to increase or decrease 18 million for fiscal 2014sharebased compensationsharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptionswe analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensationitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskwe are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations as a result of certain market risks these market risks primarily relate to foreign exchange interest rate and commodity pricerelated changes we maintain a hedging program to manage volatility related to

instruments to mitigate our exposure to interest rate movementsas part of our risk management program we perform an annual sensitivity analysis on our forecasted exposure to interest rates for the following fiscal year this analysis assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at june 30 2014 and 2013 the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 4 million and 2 million respectivelyduring fiscal 2014 we purchased marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets the fair value is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness at june 30 2014 a hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates would cause a potential decrease of up to 1 million in the estimated fair valuecommodity price
