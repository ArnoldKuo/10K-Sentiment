accounting policies that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for a discussion of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsallowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us through our distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 135 million and 137 million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 14 million and 18 million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accountsthe allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risksour methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed  quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severethe following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal yearsin millions except

notes receivables at june 30 2015 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 7 millionwe believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal june 30 2015 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenueinventories a substantial portion of our inventories 58 percent and 61 percent at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products soldthe lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our  older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2015 or 2014 inventories valued at lifo were 114 million and 98 million higher than the average 19cardinal health  fiscal 2015 form 10k mdampacritical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates cost value at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2015 and 2014inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 57 million  and 44 million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be requiredbusiness combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents developed technology and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when  an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assets purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful livesgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its identifiable net assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill we have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal  health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and cardinal health at home divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 to 11 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services  cardinal health  fiscal 2015 form 10k 20mdampacritical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates division which was fully impaired in fiscal 2013 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013 if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2015 2014 or 2013 as discussed further in note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assetvendor reserves in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made vendor reserves were 88 million and 82 million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively approximately 75 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2015 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 68 percent at the end of fiscal 2014 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptciesthe ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstancesloss contingencies we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events  we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding loss contingenciesprovision for income

anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described abovewe believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accruedtax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon  examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax

million for fiscal 2015sharebased compensation sharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding sharebased compensation cardinal health  fiscal 2015 form

2014 we purchased marketable securities which are classified as availableforsale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets the fair value is subject to change primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness at june 30 2015 and 2014 a hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest

million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date in accordance with contract terms we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due we continuously monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses which are based primarily on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write  off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountswe provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is

months and we have not historically incurred any related losses investments in marketable securities consist of a portfolio of highgrade instruments such investments are made only in instruments issued by highlyrated institutions whose financial condition we monitorour trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base including its wide geographic dispersion we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and maintain reserves

partners lp are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 18 percent 17 percent and 13 percent of revenue for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangementsinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 58 percent and 61 percent at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2015 or 2014 inventories valued at lifo were 114 million and 98 million higher than the average cost value at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2015 and 2014 our remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete

acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trade names and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair  cardinal health  fiscal 2015 form 10k 50notes to financial statements  value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates discount periods and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assetspurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks trade names and patents and developed technology are amortized over their useful livesgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its identifiable net assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwillwe have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and our cardinal health at home divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate  future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 to 11 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division in fiscal 2013 concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as discussed further in note 4 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the future forecasted undiscounted

reservesin the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the claim types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment all adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold in addition the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies vendor reserves were 88 million and 82 million at june 30 2015 and 2014 respectively excluding thirdparty returns see separate section in note 1 for a description of thirdparty returnsdistribution service agreement and other vendor feesour pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from its distribution service agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendors inventory we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees and as such a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is soldloss contingencieswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss  may differ from these estimates see note 9 for additional information regarding loss contingenciesincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the united states when it is expected that these earnings are permanently reinvestedtax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 8 for additional information regarding income taxesother accrued liabilitiesother accrued liabilities represent various current obligations including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payablesharebased compensationsharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date using a lattice valuation model the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the compensation expense recognized for sharebased awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards we classify sharebased compensation expense in distribution selling general and administrative sgampa expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees if awards are modified in connection with a restructuring activity the incremental sharebased compensation expense is classified in restructuring and employee severance see note 16 for additional information regarding sharebased compensationdividendswe paid cash dividends per common share of 137 121 and 1025 in

throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customerwe accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends margin rates and processing costs our accrual for sales returns is reflected as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost respectively at june 30 2015 and

nonmerchantable product returns from our customers many of our customers return nonmerchantable pharmaceutical products to the manufacturer through third parties since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with manufacturers our vendors pass the value of such returns to us usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction for distribution to customers we in turn pass the value received less an administrative fee to our customer in certain instances we pass the  estimated value of the return to our customer prior to our receipt of the value from the vendor although we believe we have satisfactory protections we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers we have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their

price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date it focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants a threetier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values arelevel 1 observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level 2 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilitiessee note 11 for additional information regarding fair value measurementsrecent financial accounting standardsin july 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amended accounting guidance that simplifies the current guidance surrounding the measurement of

10k notes to financial statements  or state governments that allege that false claims have been submitted or have been caused to be submitted for payment by the government after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination if the government declines to intervene the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own on behalf of the governmentfrom time to time we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer supplier or other industry participant most of these matters are resolved without incident however such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us in addition we occasionally may suspect that products we manufacture market or distribute do not meet product specifications published standards or regulatory requirements in such circumstances we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such actions can lead to product recalls costs to repair or replace affected products temporary interruptions in product sales and action by regulatorswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimateswith respect to the unresolved matters described below we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters for which there is no accrual or additional loss for matters for which we have recorded an accrual since damages or fines have not been specified or the proceedings are at stages where significant uncertainty exists as to legal or factual issues and as to whether such matters will proceed to trial we do not believe based on currently available information that the outcomes of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or cash flows though the outcome of one or more of these

acquisition and disposition agreements customer agreements intellectual property licensing agreements and other agreements such indemnification obligations vary in scope and when defined in duration in many cases a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated where appropriate such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability historically we have not individually or in the aggregate made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts in certain circumstances we believe that existing insurance arrangements subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations in addition we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not significant from time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business generally the obligation is capped at an explicit amount see note 11 for
