segments generic pharmaceutical distribution and related services businesses harvard drug also repackages generic pharmaceuticals and overthecounter healthcare productsrefer to note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on acquisitionstrends within our pharmaceutical segment we expect segment profit for fiscal 2017 to be essentially flat compared to fiscal 2016 the factors contributing to our expectation include less profit growth from the segments generics program and the loss of a large pharmaceutical distribution customer beginning april 1 2016 combined with the adverse impact of customer pricing changes similar to those in fiscal 2016 while we expect that the segments generics program will be positively impacted by benefits from both red oak sourcing and new generic pharmaceutical launches we expect that both of these items will have significantly less of a yearoveryear positive segment profit  impact in fiscal 2017 than fiscal 2016 the impact of these factors will be more pronounced in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 when we expect pharmaceutical segment profit to be significantly less than in the prioryear period and consolidated operating earnings to be less than in the prioryear period however as is generally the case the frequency magnitude and profit impact of future generic pharmaceutical product launches as well as other factors impacting our generics program are uncertain and their impact on fiscal 2017 pharmaceutical segment profit and consolidated operating earnings could be more or less than we

that i can have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and ii require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates because estimates are inherently uncertain actual results may differ in this section we describe the significant policies applied in preparing our consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on estimates and assumptions for further discussion of accounting policies for items within this section and of additional accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statementsallowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 135 million at both june 30 2016 and 2015 we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit to customers and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accountsthe allowance for doubtful accounts includes general and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risksour methodology for estimating the general reserve is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severe the following table gives

hypothetical 01 percent increase or decrease in the reserve as a percentage of trade receivables at june 30 2016 would result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 8 millionwe believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2016 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that are likely to lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenueinventories a substantial portion of our inventories 58 percent at both june 30 2016 and 2015 are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals generally tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals generally tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products soldthe lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if there is a decrease in inventory levels that have experienced pharmaceutical price appreciation the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if there is a  decrease in inventory levels that have experienced a pharmaceutical price decline the result generally will be an increase in future cost of products sold as our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2016 or 2015 because inventories valued at lifo were 9 million and 114 million higher than the average cost value at june 30 2016 and june 30 2015 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such the lifo reserve was zero at both june 30 2016 and 2015 our remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market  19cardinal health  fiscal 2016 form 10k mdampacritical

reserves may be requiredbusiness combinations the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected  future cash flows for customer relationships trademarks trade names patents developed technology inprocess research and development and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assets purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment existgoodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill our determination of estimated fair value of our reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 percent to 125 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairment we performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of our reporting units for fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily inprocess research and development iprampd requires comparing the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles under the income approach using a discounted cash flow model we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for the indefinitelived intangible including among other factors assumptions on regulatory approval for iprampdintangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks trade names and patents and developed technology are amortized using a combination of straightline and accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires estimating future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts cardinal health  fiscal 2016 form 10k20mdampacritical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates vendor reserves in the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was made vendor reserves were 62 million and 88 million at june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively approximately 66 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2016 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 75 percent at the end of fiscal 2015 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations in outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issuesthe ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are reasonable based upon current facts and circumstancesloss contingencies we accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events  we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding loss contingenciesprovision for income taxes our income tax expense deferred income tax

uncertainexpiring loss and credit carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted quarterly after applying the valuation  allowances we do not anticipate any limitations on our use of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described abovewe believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and unrecognized tax benefits are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates the amount we ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accruedtax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50

 fiscal 2016 form 10k mdampacritical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates sharebased compensation sharebased compensation provided to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of restricted share units and performance share units is determined by the grant date market price of our common shares the compensation expense associated with nonvested performance share units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate which may vary over time of the number of shares that ultimately will be issued the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptions we analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and postvesting forfeitures to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or lower than our current estimates see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for

analyzing our business based on financial information prepared in accordance with gaap we use these nongaap financial measures internally to evaluate our performance evaluate the balance sheet engage

correlated to the performance of our underlying ongoing business we provide these nongaap financial measures to investors as supplemental metrics to assist readers in assessing the effects of items

employee severance costs which include charges for programs in which we fundamentally change our operations and are excluded because they are not part of the ongoing operations of our underlying business which includes normal levels of reinvestment in the businessamortization and other acquisitionrelated costs we began excluding amortization costs in fiscal 2013 primarily for consistency with the presentation of the financial results of our peer group companies additionally these noncash amounts are variable in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions so their exclusion allows for better comparison of forecasted current and historical financial results other acquisitionrelated costs are excluded because they are directly related to an acquisition but do not meet the criteria to be recognized on the acquired entitys initial balance sheet as part of the purchase price allocation they are also significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitionsimpairments and gains or loss on disposal of assets which are excluded because they do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our ongoing business operations and their

prior or multiple periods do not occur in or reflect the ordinary course of our business and are inherently unpredictable in timing and amountlifo charges and credits which we began excluding in fiscal 2015 because the factors that drive lifo charges or credits such as pharmaceutical manufacturer price appreciationdeflation and yearend inventory levels which can be meaningfully influenced by customer buying behavior immediately preceding our fiscal yearend are largely out of our control and cannot be accurately predicted we also believe that exclusion of lifo charges from nongaap metrics allows for better comparison of our financial results to our historical operations and to our peer group companies loss on extinguishment of debt which does not typically occur in the normal course of business and may obscure analysis of trends and financial performance additionally the amount and frequency of these notable onetime charges is not consistent and is significantly impacted by the

our forecasted transactional exposure for the upcoming fiscal year these analyses include the estimated impact of our hedging program which is designed to mitigate transactional exposure our forecasted transactional exposure at june 30 2016 increased from the prior year primarily as a result of changes in the volume of transactions in foreign currencies due to the acquisition of cordis at

2016 and 2015 an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date in accordance with contract terms we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due we regularly monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses which are based primarily on  historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountswe provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 270 days to 5 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and related accrued interest were 145 million current portion 31 million and 161 million current portion 53 million at june 30

allowance for doubtful accounts of 19 million and 14 million at june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively we estimate an allowance for these financing receivables based on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountsconcentrations of credit riskwe maintain cash depository accounts with major banks and we invest in high quality shortterm liquid instruments and in marketable securities our shortterm liquid instruments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related losses investments in marketable securities consist of a portfolio of highgrade instruments such investments are made only in instruments issued by highlyrated institutions whose financial condition we monitorour trade receivables and finance notes and related accrued interest are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base including its wide geographic dispersion we perform regular credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and maintain reserves for credit losses historically such losses have been within our expectations refer to the receivables section within this note 1 for additional information on the accounting treatment of reserves for credit losses major customerscvs health corporation cvs health which is primarily serviced through our pharmaceutical segment is our only customer that individually accounts for at least 10 percent of revenue and gross trade receivables the

negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members vizient formerly novation llc and premier inc are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 17 percent 18 percent and 17 percent of revenue for fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangementsinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 58 percent at both june 30 2016 and 2015 are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories the lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within these distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuationour remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2016 or 2015 because inventories valued at lifo were 9 million and 114 million higher than the average cost value at june 30 2016 and june 30 2015 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2016 and 2015inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 79 million and 57 million at june 30 2016 and 2015 respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using

component of inventory cost and recognized as a reduction of cost of products sold when the related inventory is soldproperty and equipmentproperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated

lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment existgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount which may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a component goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each  cardinal health  fiscal 2016 form 10k52notes to financial statements  reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwillwe have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our cardinal health at home division and navihealth division cardinal health at home division and navihealth divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 85 percent to 125 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including forecasted operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 and concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying valuethe impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily inprocess research and development iprampd consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date if the carrying amount of the indefinitelived intangible exceeds its fair value an impairment loss must be recognized in an amount equal to that excess we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles under the income approach using a discounted cash flow  model we use our internal forecasts which we believe are consistent with those of a market participant to estimate future cash flows and include

accelerated methods based on the expected cash flows from the asset over their estimated useful lives we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in

vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other disputes these disputes are researched and resolved based upon the findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the  53cardinal health  fiscal 2016 form 10k notes to financial statements  type of claim and status of review though the claim types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment all adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold in addition the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies vendor reserves were 62 million and 88 million at june 30 2016 and

recognizes fees received from its distribution service agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment since the benefit provided to a vendor is related to the purchase and distribution of the vendors inventory we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees and as such a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is soldloss contingencieswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates see note 8 for additional information regarding loss

willing market participants a threetier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values arelevel 1 observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 2 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilitiessee note 10 for additional information regarding fair value measurementsrecent

involved from time to time in disputes litigation and regulatory matterswe may be named from time to time in qui tam actions which are initiated by private third parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments and which allege that false claims have been submitted or have been caused to be submitted for payment by the government after a private party has filed a qui tam action the government must investigate the private partys claim and determine whether to intervene in and take control over the litigation these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determination if the government declines to intervene the private party may nonetheless continue to pursue the litigation on his or her own on behalf of the governmentfrom time to time we receive subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to our business or to the business of a customer supplier or other industry participant most of these matters are resolved without incident however such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against us from time to time we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications regulatory requirements or published standards when we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such actions can lead to product recalls costs to repair or replace affected products temporary interruptions in product sales action by regulators and product liability claims and lawsuits including class actionswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because these matters are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimateswith respect to the matters described below we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters for which there is no accrual or additional loss for matters for which we have recorded an accrual since damages or fines have not been specified or the proceedings are at stages where significant uncertainty exists as to legal or factual issues and as to whether such matters will proceed to trial we do not believe based on currently available information that the outcomes of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations or

acquisition and disposition agreements customer agreements intellectual property licensing agreements and other agreements such indemnification obligations vary in scope and when defined in duration in many cases a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated where appropriate such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability historically we have not individually or in the aggregate made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts in certain circumstances we believe that existing insurance arrangements subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations in addition we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not probablefrom time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business generally the obligation is capped at an explicit amount see note 10 for detail
