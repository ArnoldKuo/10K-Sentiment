cardinal health chinapharmaceutical distributionour pharmaceutical distribution division generates gross margin when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost  of products sold net of cash discounts gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time although this may vary margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciationbulk and nonbulk salesthe pharmaceutical segment historically has differentiated between bulk and nonbulk sales based on the nature of our customers operations when presenting information on the segments operations the table below shows the pharmaceutical segments revenue segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk salesin

subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions past experience and judgment that we believe were reasonablebulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses in the united states all other sales were classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales required more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities warehoused the product for a longer period of time picked individual products specific to a customers order and delivered that smaller order to a customer locationbulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers and hence less costs were incurred by us in providing these products in addition bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales due to the mix of products sold 2table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiaries   within the bulk category segment distribution selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk salesin light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future as such in the future we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and nonbulk sales to investorsspecialty pharmaceutical products and serviceswe refer to products and services offered by our specialty solutions division as specialty pharmaceutical products and services the

the nature of our business we may become involved in legal proceedings that could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operationsdue to the nature of our businesses which includes the manufacture and distribution of healthcare products we may from time to time become involved in disputes or legal proceedings for instance some of the products we manufacture or distribute may be alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections we also may be named in breach of contract claims or qui tam actions false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations acquisitions can have unanticipated resultsan important element of our growth strategy has been to acquire other businesses that expand or complement our existing businesses acquisitions involve risks we may overpay for a business or fail to realize the synergies and other benefits we expect from the acquisition future developments may impair the value of our purchased goodwill or intangible assets or we may encounter unforeseen accounting internal control regulatory or compliance issueswe depend on certain suppliers to make their raw materials and products available to us and are subject to fluctuations in costs of raw materials and productswe depend on the availability of various components compounds raw materials including radioisotopes and energy supplied by others for our operations any of our supplier relationships could be interrupted due to

resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass

impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services divisionour cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion at june 30 2013 compared to 23 billion at june 30 2012 the decrease in cash and

revenueour pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens will expire at the end of august 2013 because sales to walgreens generated approximately 20 percent of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2013 we expect the expiration of this contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are taking steps to reduce our costs and otherwise mitigate the impact of the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal 2014 and afterward largely as a result of the contract expiration we do not currently expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in fiscal

assets including the 829 million nuclear pharmacy services division goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013 net litigation recoveries and charges and charges and tax benefits associated with each of these items after the expiration of this contract we also anticipate  a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by reduced accounts payable based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net aftertax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 in excess of 500 milliongoodwillin conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 we recently completed our annual goodwill impairment test which we perform annually in the fourth quarter as part of this annual test we concluded that the entire goodwill amount of our nuclear pharmacy services division was impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 829 million 799 million net of tax this impairment charge does not impact our liquidity cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenantsthe majority of the goodwill of our nuclear pharmacy services division was acquired through our acquisition of syncor international corporation in fiscal 2003 681 million of goodwill excluding the impact of the impairment charge we have a total of approximately 10 billion of invested capital in our nuclear pharmacy services division inclusive of the syncor acquisition accumulated over the past 12 years as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form 10q for the quarters ended december 31 2012 and march 31 2013 our nuclear pharmacy services division has experienced significant softness in the lowenergy diagnostics market during the second half of fiscal 2013 we experienced sustained volume declines and price erosion for the core lowenergy products provided by this division in addition we experienced reduced sales for some existing highenergy diagnostic products slowerthanexpected adoption of new highenergy diagnostic products and recent reimbursement developments that may adversely impact the future growth of these products using this information we adjusted our outlook and longterm business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process which we recently concluded this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information restructuring on january 30 2013 we announced a restructuring plan within our medical segment under this restructuring plan we are moving production of procedure kits from our facility in waukegan illinois to other facilities and selling property and consolidating office space in waukegan illinois in addition we reorganized our medical segment and plan to sell our sterilization processes in el paso texas we estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately 79 million on a pretax basis of which 51

determined that at june 30 2013 it does not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale the costs recognized during 2013 are classified as restructuring and employee severance and

on september 30 2012 of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts approximately 67 billion the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately 36 billion primarily as a result of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than from us the decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers approximately 38 billion and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division 961

distribution businesses and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 134 million and 126 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we also provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 120 days to 7 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest income on these arrangements is recognized as it is earned the financings may be collateralized guaranteed by third parties or unsecured finance notes and accrued interest receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of 17 million and 16 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively and are included in other assets current portion is included in prepaid expenses and other we must use judgment when deciding whether to extend credit and when estimating the required allowance for doubtful accountsthe allowance for doubtful accounts includes portfolio and specific reserves we determine the appropriate allowance by reviewing accounts receivable aging industry trends customer financial strength and credit standing historical writeoff trends and payment history we also regularly evaluate how changes in economic conditions may affect credit risksour methodology for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts is assessed annually based on historical losses and economic business and market trends in addition the allowance is reviewed quarterly and updated if appropriate we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts if changes in customers financial condition or general economic conditions make defaults more frequent or severethe following table gives information regarding the allowance for doubtful accounts over the past three fiscal yearsin millions except percentages2013 2012 2011allowance for doubtful

increase or decrease in bad debt expense of 6 millionwe believe the reserve maintained and expenses recorded in fiscal 2013 are appropriate at this time we are not aware of any analytical findings or customer issues that might lead to a significant future increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenueinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 65 percent and 69 percent at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lifo method or market these are primarily merchandise inventories at the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities within our pharmaceutical segment the lifo impact on the consolidated statements of earnings in a given year depends on pharmaceutical price  appreciation and the level of inventory prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise which results in an increase in cost of products sold whereas prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline which results in a decrease in cost of products soldthe lifo method presumes that the most recent inventory purchases are the first items sold so lifo helps us better match current costs and revenue using lifo if branded pharmaceutical inventory levels decline the result generally will be a decrease in future cost of products sold prices for branded pharmaceuticals tend to rise over time so our older inventory is held at a lower cost conversely if generic pharmaceutical inventory levels decline future cost of products sold generally will increase prices for generic pharmaceuticals tend to decline over time so our older inventory is held at a higher cost we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation reasonably approximates the current cost of replacing inventory within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities accordingly the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuation the remaining inventory is stated at the lower of cost using the first in first out method or market if we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the pharmaceutical distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2013 or 2012 primarily because prices for our generic pharmaceutical inventories have continued to decline inventories valued at lifo were 97 million and 72 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2013 and 2012inventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 40 million and 37 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we reserve for inventory obsolescence using estimates based on historical experience sales trends specific categories of inventory and age of onhand inventory if actual conditions are less favorable than our assumptions additional inventory reserves may be requiredbusiness combinationsthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trade names and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and therefore could materially affect our financial position or results of 19table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesfinancial review continuedoperations see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assetspurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful livesgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a componentwe have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our assuramed division and assuramed divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 12 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments  that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2013 and 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment if we were to alter our impairment testing by increasing the discount rate in the discounted cash flow analysis by 1 percent there still would not be any impairment indicated for any of these reporting units for fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 as discussed further in note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax noncash goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earnings we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assetvendor reservesin the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience changes to the estimate percentages affect the cost of products sold in the period in which the change was madevendor reserves were 66 million and 75 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively approximately 60 percent of the vendor reserve at the end of fiscal 2013 pertained to the pharmaceutical segment compared to 79 percent at the end of fiscal 2012 the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptciesthe ultimate outcome of specific claims may be different than our original estimate and may require adjustment we believe however that reserves recorded for such disputes are adequate based upon current facts and circumstancesprovision for income taxesour income tax expense deferred income tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be

ultimately pay when matters are resolved may differ from the amounts accruedtax benefits from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits if

fiscal 2013sharebased compensationsharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model we believe the lattice model provides reasonable estimates because it has the ability to take into account employee exercise patterns based on changes in our stock price and other variables and it provides for a range of input assumptionswe analyze historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted is calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years as required the forfeiture estimates are adjusted to reflect actual forfeitures when an award vests the actual forfeitures in future reporting periods could be higher or

assumes a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates at both june 30 2013 and 2012 the potential increase or decrease in annual interest expense under this analysis as a result of this hypothetical change was 2 millioncommodity price sensitivitywe are exposed to market price changes for commodities including oilbased resins cotton latex and diesel fuel we typically purchase raw materials at market prices and some finished goods at prices based in part on a commodity price index as part of our risk management program we perform sensitivity analysis on our forecasted commodity exposure for the following fiscal year our forecasted commodity exposure at june 30 2013 decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of commodity prices and changes in purchasing volumesat june 30 2013 and 2012 we had hedged a portion of these commodity exposures see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion the table below summarizes our analysis

allowance for doubtful accounts of 134 million and 126 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively an account is considered past due on the first day after its due date in accordance with contract terms we generally have the ability to charge customers service fees or higher prices if an account is considered past due we continuously monitor past due accounts and establish appropriate reserves to cover potential losses which are based primarily on historical collection rates and the credit worthiness of the customer we write off any amounts deemed uncollectible against the established allowance for doubtful accountswe provide financing to various customers such financing arrangements range from 120 days to 7 years at interest rates that are generally subject to fluctuation interest

shortterm liquid instruments such investments are made only in instruments issued by highly rated institutions these investments mature within three months and we have not historically incurred any related lossesour trade receivables finance notes and accrued interest receivables are exposed to a concentration of credit risk with customers in the retail and healthcare sectors credit risk can be affected by changes in reimbursement and other economic pressures impacting the healthcare industry such credit risk is limited due to supporting collateral and the diversity of the customer base including its wide geographic dispersion we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial conditions and maintain reserves for credit losses historically such losses have been within our expectations30table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedmajor customersthe following table summarizes all of our customers that

pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co which is scheduled to expire at the end of august 2013 will not be renewedwe have entered into agreements with group purchasing organizations gpos which act as purchasing agents that negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members novation llc and premier purchasing partners lp are our two largest gpo member relationships in terms of revenue sales to members of these two gpos collectively accounted for 13 percent 13 percent and 14 percent of revenue for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our trade receivable balances are with individual members of the gpo and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists with these types of arrangementsinventoriesa substantial portion of our inventories 65 percent and 69 percent at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively are valued at the lower of cost using the lastin firstout lifo method or market these inventories are included within the core pharmaceutical distribution facilities of our pharmaceutical segment distribution facilities and are primarily merchandise inventories we believe that the average cost method of inventory valuation provides a reasonable approximation of the current cost of replacing inventory within the distribution facilities as such the lifo reserve is the difference between a inventory at the lower of lifo cost or market and b inventory at replacement cost determined using the average cost method of inventory valuationif we had used the average cost method of inventory valuation for all inventory within the distribution facilities the value of our inventories would not have changed in fiscal 2013 or 2012 inventories valued at lifo were 97 million and 72 million higher than the average cost value as of june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we do not record inventories in excess of replacement cost as such we did not record any changes in our lifo reserve in fiscal 2013 and 2012 our remaining inventory is primarily stated at the lower of cost using the firstin firstout method or marketinventories presented in the consolidated balance sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory which were 40

property and equipmentproperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation property and equipment held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amountsas a result of the reductions in the anticipated future cash flows in our nuclear pharmacy services division as discussed in note 5 we also performed recoverability testing for the longlived assets of this division which consist primarily of improvements machinery and equipment based on the assessment performed we determined that the carrying amounts of the longlived assets are recoverabledepreciation expense is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets including capital lease assets which are depreciated over the terms of their respective leases we generally use the following range of useful lives for our property and equipment categories buildings and improvements3 to 39 years machinery and equipment3 to 20 years and furniture and fixtures3 to 7 years we recorded depreciation

interest rate on longterm obligations which was 378 percent at june 30 2013 the amount of capitalized interest was immaterial for all periods presentedbusiness combinationsthe assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination including identifiable intangible assets are based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill we base the fair values of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions critical estimates and assumptions include expected future cash flows for customer relationships trade names and other identifiable intangible assets discount rates that reflect the risk factors associated with future cash flows and estimates of useful lives when an acquisition involves contingent consideration we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the acquisition date the estimate of fair value of a contingent consideration obligation requires subjective assumptions to be made regarding future business results discount rates and probabilities assigned to various potential business result scenarios subsequent revisions to these assumptions could materially change the estimate of the fair value of contingent consideration obligations and 31table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedtherefore could materially affect our financial position or results of operations see note 2 for additional information regarding our acquisitionsgoodwill and other intangible assetspurchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment exist intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships trademarks and patents and noncompete agreements are amortized over their useful livesgoodwill impairment testing involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting units to the respective carrying amount this step may be performed utilizing either a qualitative or quantitative assessment if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount then no impairment exists if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value then a second step is performed to determine the amount of impairment if any an impairment charge is the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the estimated implied fair value of goodwill we estimate the implied fair value of goodwill as the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of its net tangible and identifiable intangible assets this is the same manner we use to recognize goodwill from a business combination goodwill impairment testing involves judgment including the identification of reporting units the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit and if necessary the estimation of the implied fair value of goodwill a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment also known as a componentwe have two operating segments which are the same as our reportable segments pharmaceutical and medical these operating segments are comprised of divisions components for which discrete financial information is available components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing to the extent that they share similar economic characteristics our reporting units are pharmaceutical operating segment excluding our nuclear pharmacy services division and cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division nuclear pharmacy services division cardinal health china  pharmaceutical division medical operating segment excluding our assuramed division and assuramed divisionfair value can be determined using market income or costbased approaches our determination of estimated fair value of the reporting units is based on a combination of the incomebased and marketbased approaches under the incomebased approach we use a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several future periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate riskadjusted rate of return we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and include an estimate of longterm growth rates based on our most recent views of the longterm outlook for each reporting unit actual results may differ materially from those used in our forecasts we use discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and in our internallydeveloped forecasts discount rates used in our reporting unit valuations ranged from 9 to 12 percent under the marketbased approach we determine fair value by comparing our reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets to further confirm fair value we compare the aggregate fair value of our  reporting units to our total market capitalization estimating the fair value of reporting units requires the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results the use of alternate estimates and assumptions or changes in the industry or peer groups could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and potentially result in goodwill impairmentwe performed annual impairment testing in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and with the exception of our nuclear pharmacy services division concluded that there were no impairments of goodwill as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value for our fiscal 2013 and 2012 testing we elected to bypass the optional qualitative assessment as discussed further in note 5 during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 we recognized an 829 million 799 million net of tax goodwill impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services division which is included in impairments and loss on disposal of assets in our consolidated statements of earningswe review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assetvendor reservesin the ordinary course of business our vendors may dispute deductions taken against payments otherwise due to them or assert other billing disputes these disputed transactions are researched and resolved based upon our policy and findings of the research performed at any given time there are outstanding items in various stages of research and resolution in determining appropriate reserves for areas of exposure with our vendors we assess historical experience and current outstanding claims we have established various levels of reserves based on the type of claim and status of review though the transaction types are relatively consistent we periodically refine our methodology by updating the reserve estimate percentages to reflect actual historical experience the ultimate outcome of certain claims may be different than our original estimate and may require an adjustment all adjustments to vendor reserves are included in cost of products sold in addition the reserve balance will fluctuate due to variations of outstanding claims from periodtoperiod timing of settlements and specific vendor issues such as bankruptcies vendor reserves were 66 million and 75 million at june 30 2013 and 2012 respectively excluding thirdparty returns see separate section in note 1 for a description of thirdparty returnsvendor incentivesfees for services and other incentives received from vendors relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory represent product discounts and are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings upon sale of the related inventoryincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method the asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between the tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings 32table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial

more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination of the technical merits of the position including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement see note 7 for additional information regarding income taxesother accrued liabilitiesother accrued liabilities represent various current obligations including certain accrued operating expenses and taxes payablesharebased compensationsharebased compensation to employees is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings based on the grant date fair value of the awards the fair value of stock options is determined using a lattice valuation model the compensation expense recognized for sharebased awards is net of estimated forfeitures and is recognized ratably over the service period of the awards we generally classify sharebased compensation expense within distribution selling general and administrative sgampa expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees see note 15 for

accordance with accounting standards addressing reporting revenue on a gross basis as a principal versus on a net basis as an agent this revenue is recorded on a gross basis since we incur credit risk

that the product be physically returned subject to restocking fees in a condition suitable to be added back to inventory and resold at full value or returned to vendors for credit merchantable product product returns are generally consistent throughout the year and typically are not specific to any particular product or customereffective june 30 2013 we updated our policy to accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon historical customer return trends margin rates and processing costs this prospective change did not have a material effect on consolidated revenue cost of products sold and operating earnings at june 30 2013 the accrual for estimated sales returns and allowances was 291 million the impact of which is reflected in trade receivables net and inventories net in the consolidated balance sheets prior to this change in policy we recognized sales returns as a reduction of revenue and cost of products sold for the sales price and cost respectively when products were returned amounts recorded in revenue and cost of products sold under our prior accounting policy closely approximated what would have been recorded had we accrued for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of the sale transaction as such retrospective adoption of our new policy to accrue for estimated sales returns and allowances would not have

respectivelythirdparty returnssince we generally do not accept nonmerchantable product returns from our customers many of our customers return nonmerchantable pharmaceutical products to our vendors through third parties since our customers generally do not have a direct relationship with our vendors our vendors pass the value of the returns to us usually in the form of an accounts payable deduction we in turn pass the value received less an administrative fee to our customer in certain instances we pass the estimated value of the return to our customer prior to processing the deduction with our vendors although we believe we have satisfactory protections we could be subject to claims from customers or vendors if our administration of this overall process was deficient in some respect or our contractual terms with vendors are in conflict with our contractual terms with our customers we have maintained reserves for some of these situations based on their nature and our historical experience with their resolutiondistribution service agreement and other vendor feesour pharmaceutical segment recognizes fees received from its distribution service agreements and other fees received from vendors related to the purchase or distribution of the vendors inventory when those fees have been earned and we are entitled to payment we recognize the fees as a reduction in the carrying value of the inventory that generated the fees and as such the fees are recognized as a reduction of cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of earnings when the inventory is

valuation of identifiable intangible assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs and thus represents a level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement as further defined in note 10 the estimated fair value of the identifiable intangible assets was determined using an incomebased approach which includes market participant expectations of the cash flows that an asset could generate over its remaining useful life discounted back to present value using an appropriate rate of return the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the identifiable intangible assets was 95 percent to reflect the internal rate of return and uncertainty in the cash flow projections the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the

disclosed in our quarterly reports on form 10q for the 36table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statements continuedquarters ended december 31 2012 and march 31 2013 our nuclear pharmacy services division has experienced significant softness in the lowenergy diagnostics market we performed interim goodwill impairment testing for this reporting unit during the three months ended december 31 2012 and determined that there was no impairment as the fair value of the reporting unit was estimated to be in excess of its carrying amount during the second half of fiscal 2013 we experienced sustained volume declines and price erosion for the core lowenergy products provided by this division in addition we experienced reduced sales for some existing highenergy diagnostic products slowerthanexpected adoption of new highenergy diagnostic products and recent reimbursement developments that may adversely impact the future growth of these products using this information we adjusted our outlook and longterm business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process which we recently concluded this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit using a combination of the incomebased approach using a discount rate of 10 percent and the marketbased approach the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated to be below the carrying amount and therefore indicated impairment the second step of the impairment test resulted in the impairment of the entire 829 million carrying amount of goodwill for this reporting unit our fair value estimates utilize significant unobservable inputs and thus represent level 3 fair value

out of the normal conduct of our business we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in such litigationwe may be named from time to time in qui tam actions which are cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments that allege that false claims have been submitted or have been caused to be submitted for payment by the government after a qui tam action has been filed the government must investigate and determine whether to intervene in the matter these actions may remain under seal while the government makes this determinationin addition we occasionally may suspect that products we manufacture market or distribute do not meet product specifications published standards or regulatory requirements in such circumstances we investigate and take appropriate corrective action such actions can lead to product recalls costs to repair or replace affected products temporary interruptions in product sales and action by regulatorswe accrue for contingencies related to disputes litigation and regulatory matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated because litigation is inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments  about future events we regularly review contingencies to determine whether our accruals and related disclosures are adequate the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for matters described below since damages or fines have not been specified and the proceedings are in early stages with significant uncertainty as to factual issues we do not believe based on currently available information that the outcomes of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition though the outcomes could be material to our results of

class memberincome taxessee note 7 for discussion of contingencies related to our income taxes9 guaranteesin the ordinary course of business we agree to indemnify certain other parties under acquisition and disposition agreements customer agreements intellectual property licensing agreements and other agreements such indemnification obligations vary in scope and when defined in duration in many cases a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated and therefore the overall maximum amount of the liability under such indemnification obligations cannot be reasonably estimated where appropriate such indemnification obligations are recorded as a liability historically we have not individually or in the aggregate made payments under these indemnification obligations in any material amounts in certain circumstances we believe that existing insurance arrangements subject to the general deduction and exclusion provisions would cover portions of the liability that may arise from these indemnification obligations in addition we believe that the likelihood of a material liability being triggered under these indemnification obligations is not significantfrom time to time we enter into agreements that obligate us to make fixed payments upon the occurrence of certain events such obligations primarily relate to obligations arising under acquisition transactions where we have agreed to make payments based upon the achievement of certain financial performance measures by the acquired business generally the obligation is capped at an explicit amount see note 2 for detail regarding the p4 healthcare contingent consideration obligation10 fair value measurementsfair value is defined as the price that would be received upon selling an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability on the measurement date it focuses on the exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants a threetier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value this hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs the three levels of inputs used to measure fair values are as followslevel 1 observable prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilitieslevel 2 observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level 3 unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilitiesrecurring fair value measurementsthe following tables present the fair values for

11201cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less the carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair value due to their shortterm maturities2the fair value of interest rate swaps foreign currency contracts and commodity contracts is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows considering the risks involved including nonperformance risk and using discount rates appropriate for the respective maturities observable level 2 inputs are used to determine the present value of expected future cash flows3the other investments balance includes investments in mutual funds which are used to offset fluctuations in deferred compensation liabilities these mutual funds primarily invest in the equity securities of companies with large market capitalization and high quality fixed income debt securities the fair value of these investments is determined using quoted market prices4the contingent consideration obligation was incurred in connection with the acquisition of p4 healthcare the former owners of p4 healthcare had the right to receive certain contingent payments based on targeted ebitda the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation was determined based on a probabilityweighted income approach derived from ebitda estimates and probability assessments with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various ebitda targets the fair value measurement was based on significant inputs unobservable in the market and thus represented a level 3 measurement at each reporting date we revalued the contingent consideration obligation to estimated fair value changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation resulted from changes in the terms of the contingent payments changes in discount periods and rates changes in the timing and amount of ebitda estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the timing and likelihood of achieving the ebitda targets as a result of changes in our estimate of performance in future periods coupled with the progress of discussions with the former owners regarding an early termination and settlement we recorded a 71 million decrease in fair value of the obligation to 4 million at june 30 2012 we terminated and settled the remaining contingent consideration obligation in july 2012 for 4 million11 financial instrumentswe utilize derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to certain risks related to our ongoing operations the primary risks managed through the use of derivative instruments include interest rate risk currency exchange risk and commodity price risk we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes while the majority of our

require collateral under these agreementsinterest rate risk managementwe are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on cash flows

provides for a range of input assumptions which are disclosed in the table below the riskfree rate is based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of the grant we analyzed historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and employee terminations to be used within the lattice model the expected life of the options granted was calculated from the option valuation model and represents the length of time in years that the options granted are expected to be outstanding expected volatilities are based on implied volatility from traded options on our common shares and historical volatility over a period of time commensurate with the contractual term of the option grant up to ten years the following table provides the range of assumptions used to estimate the fair value of
