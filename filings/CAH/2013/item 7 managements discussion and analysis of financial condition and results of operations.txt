programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time although this may vary margin from branded

subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions past experience and judgment that we believe were reasonablebulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses in the united states all other sales were classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales required more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities warehoused the product for a longer period of time picked individual products specific to a customers order and delivered that smaller order to a customer locationbulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers and hence less costs were incurred by us in providing these products in addition bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales due to the mix of products sold 2table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiaries   within the bulk category segment distribution selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk salesin light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future as such in the future we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and nonbulk

providers focus on patient care while reducing costs enhancing efficiency and improving quality we also provide medical products to patients in the home we report our financial results in two segments pharmaceutical and medicalduring fiscal 2013 revenue decreased 6 percent to 1011 billion largely due to the previously disclosed expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts and the impact of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions gross margin increased 8 percent to 49 billion reflecting strong performance in our pharmaceutical segment generic programs

impairment charge related to our nuclear pharmacy services divisionour cash and equivalents balance was 19 billion at june 30 2013 compared to 23 billion at june 30 2012 the decrease in cash and

revenueour pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreens will expire at the end of august 2013 because sales to walgreens generated approximately 20 percent of our consolidated revenue for fiscal 2013 we expect the expiration of this contract to have an adverse impact on our results of operations we are taking steps to reduce our costs and otherwise mitigate the impact of the expiration of the walgreens contract in fiscal 2014 and afterward largely as a result of the contract expiration we do not currently expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to grow in fiscal

assets including the 829 million nuclear pharmacy services division goodwill impairment charge in fiscal 2013 net litigation recoveries and charges and charges and tax benefits associated with each of these items after the expiration of this contract we also anticipate  a significant net working capital decrease based on reduced inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by reduced accounts payable based on the expected working capital decrease and other factors we anticipate that the expiration of the walgreens contract will result in a net aftertax benefit to cash flow from operating activities in fiscal 2014 in excess of 500 milliongoodwillin conjunction with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 we recently completed our annual goodwill impairment test which we perform annually in the fourth quarter as part of this annual test we concluded that the entire goodwill amount of our nuclear pharmacy services division was impaired resulting in a noncash impairment charge of 829 million 799 million net of tax this impairment charge does not impact our liquidity cash flows from operations or compliance with debt covenantsthe majority of the goodwill of our nuclear pharmacy services division was acquired through our acquisition of syncor international corporation in fiscal 2003 681 million of goodwill excluding the impact of the impairment charge we have a total of approximately 10 billion of invested capital in our nuclear pharmacy services division inclusive of the syncor acquisition accumulated over the past 12 years as previously disclosed in our quarterly reports on form 10q for the quarters ended december 31 2012 and march 31 2013 our nuclear pharmacy services division has experienced significant softness in the lowenergy diagnostics market during the second half of fiscal 2013 we experienced sustained volume declines and price erosion for the core lowenergy products provided by this division in addition we experienced reduced sales for some existing highenergy diagnostic products slowerthanexpected adoption of new highenergy diagnostic products and recent reimbursement developments that may adversely impact the future growth of these products using this information we adjusted our outlook and longterm business plans for this division during our annual budgeting process which we recently concluded this update resulted in significant reductions in the anticipated future cash flows and estimated fair value for this reporting unit see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information restructuring on january 30 2013 we announced a restructuring plan within our medical segment under this restructuring plan we are moving production of procedure kits from our facility in waukegan illinois to other facilities and selling property and consolidating office space in waukegan illinois in addition we reorganized our medical segment and plan to sell our sterilization processes in el paso texas we estimate the total costs associated with this restructuring plan to be approximately 79 million on a pretax basis of which 51 million was recognized during fiscal 2013 of the estimated 28 million remaining costs to be recognized through the end of fiscal 2014 we estimate that approximately 3 million will be employeerelated costs 11 million will be facility exit and other costs and 14 million will be an expected loss on disposal of the property in waukegan illinois described above we have evaluated this property and have determined that at june 30 2013 it does not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale the costs recognized during 2013 are classified as restructuring and employee severance and

on september 30 2012 of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with express scripts approximately 67 billion the revenue from which was classified as bulk sales revenue from existing pharmaceutical distribution customers decreased by approximately 36 billion primarily as a result of brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions brandtogeneric pharmaceutical conversions impact our revenue because generic pharmaceuticals generally sell at a lower price than the corresponding brand product and because some of our customers primarily source generic products directly from manufacturers rather than from us the decrease was partially offset by increased pharmaceutical distribution revenue from new customers approximately 38 billion and revenue growth within our specialty solutions division 961 million revenue from bulk sales was 298 billion and 402 billion for fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively bulk sales for fiscal 2013 decreased by 26 percent driven primarily by the expiration of our

6 percent driven by growth from new customers see item 1 business for more information about bulk and nonbulk sales in light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical
