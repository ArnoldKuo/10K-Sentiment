products sold net of cash discounts gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time although this may vary margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciationbulk and nonbulk salesthe pharmaceutical segment historically has differentiated between bulk and nonbulk sales based on the nature of our customers operations when presenting information on the segments operations the table below shows the pharmaceutical segments revenue segment expenses segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and nonbulk salesin

subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions past experience and judgment that we believe were reasonablebulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers centralized warehouse operations and customers mail order businesses in the united states all other sales were classified as nonbulk sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and nonbulk sales with respect to its retail stores substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping in contrast nonbulk sales required more complex servicing for nonbulk sales we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities warehoused the product for a longer period of time picked individual products specific to a customers order and delivered that smaller order to a customer locationbulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than nonbulk sales as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers and hence less costs were incurred by us in providing these products in addition bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than nonbulk sales due to the mix of products sold 2table of contents cardinal health inc and subsidiaries   within the bulk category segment distribution selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from nonbulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than nonbulk salesin light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with walgreen co walgreens we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future as such in the future we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and nonbulk

the companies respective businesses and other matters if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the irs ruling or the opinions of tax counsel similarly the irs could determine on audit that the carefusion spinoff is taxable if it determines that any of the facts assumptions

alleged to cause personal injury or violate the intellectual property rights of another party subjecting us to product liability or infringement claims while we generally obtain indemnity rights from the manufacturers of products we distribute and we carry product liability insurance it is possible that liability from such claims could exceed those protections we also may be named in breach of

unfavorable resolution of one or more of these legal proceedings could adversely affect our cash flows or results of operations acquisitions can have unanticipated resultsan important element of our

resins cotton latex and other commodities as raw materials in many products prices of oil and gas also affect our distribution and transportation costs prices of these commodities are volatile and have fluctuated significantly in recent years so costs to produce and distribute our products also have fluctuated due to competitive dynamics and contractual limitations we may be unable to pass

could be adversely affectedour global operations are subject to economic political and currency risksour global operations are affected by local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition political changes also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location we may not be able to hedge or obtain insurance to protect us against these risks and any hedges or insurance may be expensive and may not successfully mitigate these risks economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and servicesdeterioration in general economic conditions in the united states and other countries in which we do business could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions filled and the number of medical procedures undertaken and therefore reduce purchases of our products and services by our customers which could adversely affect our results of operations
