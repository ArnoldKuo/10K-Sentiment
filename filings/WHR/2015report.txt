basecompetitioncompetition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux general electric panasonic haier kenmore lg mabe and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our regional footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measuresraw materials and purchased componentswe are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedulestrademarks licenses and patentswe consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid amana and acros the most important trademarks to latin america are consul brastemp whirlpool and kitchenaid the most important

protect our designs and technologiesresearch and developmentexpenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 563 million 582 million and 553 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyprotection of the environmentour manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility4we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2014 and are not expected to be material in 2015the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulationsstate and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of superfund sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding

materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the followingrisks relating to our businesswe face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier lg panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affectedwe face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and participate in joint ventures we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activitiesour growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us if our compliance policies including the requirement to comply with all laws are not followed such noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hefei sanyo and indesit acquisitions7the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operationsrisks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2014 we derived approximately 47 of our net sales from outside of north america including 23 in latin america 20 in emea and 4 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the followingpolitical legal and economic instability and uncertaintyforeign currency exchange rate fluctuationschanges in foreign country tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax lawsinflationchanges in foreign country regulatory requirementsvarious importexport restrictions and the availability of required importexport licensesimposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriersmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and antitrust lawswork stoppages and labor relationsdisruptions in the shipping of imported and exported productsgovernment price controlsextended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable andlimitations on the repatriation of earnings and cashas a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on usterrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewherefluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 8foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure unfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities relating to befiex cfc tax and to ipi tax credits see note 7 and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse affect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters no insurance is likely available regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserveswe are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions for example we have been subject to governmental investigations related to pricing practices of our global compressor business see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operationschanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect usfailure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations9in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affectedan inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and enable us to receive an acceptable return on our investments our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breachin addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee moraleour information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our businessproduct liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance therefore any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flowswe regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations10we face inventory and other asset risk we writedown product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultschanges in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher deficit spending and debt levels and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states latin america europe and the other areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performancewe are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain economic conditions within our regions and slow recovery in europe and asia along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates the demand for our products depends largely on consumer spending and the availability of financing economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectivelyuncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital marketsif we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 11our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operationsa deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2014 we had approximately 100000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees and may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitivenesswe have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performancemoreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain productssignificant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as of december 31 2014 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 16 billion 11 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 05 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses 12item 1bunresolved staff commentsnoneitem 2propertiesour principal executive offices are located in

calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and

accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates pension and other postretirement benefitsaccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense26managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of

which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is madeas of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had total deferred tax assets of 32 billion and 30 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 308 million and 186 million respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million in 2011 to the current year tax expense of 189 million and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including remaining befiex credits business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws in

historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangiblescertain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2014 we had goodwill of 28 billion goodwill increased by 11 billion in 2014 due to the acquisitions of hefei sanyo and indesit there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for goodwill resulting from the acquisitions we have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a carrying value of approximately 15 billion 629 million and 42 million respectively as of december 31 2014 we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist goodwill valuationswe evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment test in 2014 this assessment was performed for the nar and lar operating segments as impairment indicators do not exist for goodwill acquired in 2014in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative tests performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit actual and projected operating results relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill evaluating goodwill  results and significant assumptions based on the favorable results of the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2014 there was no goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2014 28managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedfor our north america reporting unit our qualitative assessment included a review of the events and factors outlined above our last quantitative test was performed in 2011 significant weight was provided to the following factors as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unitoperating profit margins remain strong for the third consecutive year at 101 in 2014 compared to 105 and 88 in 2013 and 2012 respectively margins have been driven by higher net sales ongoing cost productivity the benefit of cost and capacityreduction initiatives as well as our continued ability to deliver innovative and consumer relevant products to the marketplace the improvement in operating margins compared to the prior quantitative assessment performed in 2011 provides significant positive evidence for the qualitative assessmentwe experienced a 125 basis point decrease in the discount rate from our last quantitative assessment performed in 2011 primarily driven by a decrease in the risk free rate and a decline in our company specific risk premium the decrease in the company specific risk premium is driven largely by the structural improvement in our operating model delivered through successful execution of our cost and capacity reductions and implementation of previously announced costbased price increases since 2011 the decrease in the discount rate provides significant positive evidence for the qualitative assessmentthe implied increases to the fair value of our north america reporting unit noted above are further supported by an increase in our overall market capitalization of approximately 11 billion or approximately 280 as of october 1 2014 compared to the prior quantitative assessment in 2011 this increase is largely attributable to the improved operating performance of the north america reporting unit intangible valuationswe evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative testwhen the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value evaluating trademarks  results and significant assumptionswe performed a qualitative assessment for one trademark with a value of approximately 18 million our prior quantitative test performed in 2011 indicated that the fair value for this trademark exceeded its respective carrying value by approximately 400 based on the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2014 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of this trademark was greater than its respective carrying value therefore no impairment was recordedbased on the results of our impairment test performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately 12 million the fair values of all other trademarks tested exceed their carrying values by more than 10 with the exception of one north american trademark the fair value of this trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately 1 billion by 5 the fair value of this trademark was lower in 2014 as a result of extended transitions to deliver product innovation in north america we invested significantly in this trademark in 2014 and are on track to deliver these new products in 2015in performing the quantitative test significant assumptions used in our relief from royalty model as of october 1 2014 included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our annual long range plan and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment for the appliance industry or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a future impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues would result in an impairment of approximately 56 million29managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedin determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the intrinsic royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademark the most significant factors in determining the intrinsic royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in a given market segment based on this analysis we determined royalty rates of 2 to 3 for our value brands 35 to 4 for our mass market brands and 6 for our super premium brand we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point reduction of the royalty rates for each brand would result in an impairment of approximately 175 millionin developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used the industry average weighted average cost of capital as the base adjusted for the higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined discount rates ranging from 85 to 1025 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that an increase in the discount rates used for the valuation of 100 basis points would result in an impairment of approximately 100 millionmany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairmentsfor additional information about goodwill and intangible valuations see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsissued but not yet effective accounting

based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the asu also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract this pronouncement is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 including interim periods within that reporting period and is to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods with early application not permitted we have not yet determined the potential effects on the consolidated condensed financial statements if anyall other issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statementsother mattersembraco antitrust mattersbeginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the united states embraco also has resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending additional lawsuits could be filedat december 31 2014 25 million remains accrued with installment payments of 21 million plus interest remaining to be made to government authorities at various times through 2015 we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodbefiex credits and other tax mattersin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales as the credits are monetized we monetized 14 million 109 million and 37 million of export credits in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we recognized export credits as they were monetized30managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedin december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2014 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period is currently being reviewed by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits the outcome and timing of the brazilian court decisions remains uncertain our brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2014 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 14 billion brazilian reais approximately 533 million as of december 31 2014relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 204 million brazilian reais approximately 78 million as of december 31 2014 reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these mattersin 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled in our case finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2014 our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 178 million brazilian reais approximately 67 million as of december 31 2014 we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2014in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million brazilian reais approximately 28 million as of december 31 2014 paid in 30 monthly installments from december 2013in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other befiex matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions litigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period31managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedother litigationwe are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment product liability claims and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of many of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product liability claims fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our consolidated financial statements other mattersin 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in france the investigation includes 11 manufacturers including the whirlpool and indesit operations in france although it is currently not

business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2014 a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain or loss of approximately 6580 million consistent with the use of these

amana bauknecht jennair and indesit whirlpools reportable segments consist of north america latin america emea europe middle east and africa and asia principles of consolidationour consolidated financial statements include all majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation we do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have an ownership interest of 50 or less unless that company is deemed to be a variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary certain vies are consolidated when the company is the primary beneficiary of these entities and has the ability to directly impact the activities of these entitiesreclassificationswe reclassified certain prior period amounts in our consolidated financial statements to be consistent with current period presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not materialuse of estimateswe are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimatesrevenue recognitionsales are recorded when title passes to the customer as determined by the shipping terms for the majority of our sales title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped for a portion of our sales title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customers location allowances for estimated returns are made on sales of certain products based on historical return rates for the products involvedaccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accountswe carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances credit conditions and the history of writeoffs and collections we evaluate items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable writeoffs in general our policy is to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due a receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within agreed upon invoice termssecuritization of financing receivables  variable interest entitiesindesit acquired by whirlpool in the fourth quarter of 2014 has maintained a securitization program since 2010 the securitization involves the withoutrecourse sale of trade receivables by indesit the receivables are acquired by special purpose entities spes which are financed by the issuance of securities whose repayment is guaranteed by the cash flows generated by the receivables soldat december 31 2014 liabilities related to the securitization were comprised of senior securities issued on the assetbacked security market and totaled 88 million at the same date financial receivables represented by junior securities total 53 million cash not yet collected on receivables sold was 38 million and cash held by the spes reflected in other current assets due to its restricted use for debt repayment was 5 million at december 31 2014 35 million from the securitization is included in whirlpools notes payable balance the spes related to the securitization are designed to create and pass along debt proceeds and related debt expenses to indesit its interest holder additionally indesit has the ability to directly impact the activities of these entities therefore these entities are considered variable interest entities and indesit is considered the primary beneficiary of these entities accordingly the results of these entities have been consolidated into whirlpools financial results at december 31 201440notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedwhirlpool stopped the sale of receivables related to the securitization beginning in december 2014 we anticipate exiting this debt securitization by the end of the first quarter of 2015freight and warehousing costswe classify freight and warehousing costs within cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of incomecash and equivalentsall highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalentsrestricted cashrestricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire a portion of the shares needed to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo in october 2014 the restricted cash is used to fund capital and technical resources to enhance hefei sanyos research and development and working capital as of december 31 2014 restricted cash was approximately 237 million of which approximately 50 million is recorded in other current assets with the remaining portion recorded in other noncurrent assetsfair value measurementswe measure fair value based on an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we had no level 3 assets or liabilities at december 31 2014 and 2013 with the exception of those disclosed in note 13we measured fair value for money market funds and available for sale investments using quoted market prices in active markets for identical or comparable assets we measured fair value for derivative contracts all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings based on model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from observable market data inventoriesinventories are stated at firstin firstout fifo cost except united states production inventories which are stated at lastin firstout lifo cost and latin america asia and certain emea inventories which are stated at average cost costs do not exceed net realizable values see note 5 for additional information about inventoriespropertyproperty is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation for production machinery and equipment we record depreciation based on units produced unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straightline method excluding property acquired from hefei sanyo and indesit acquisitions for nonproduction assets and assets acquired from hefei sanyo and indesit as of december 31 2014 we depreciate costs based on the straightline method depreciation expense for property including accelerated depreciation classified as restructuring expense in our consolidated statements of income was 527 million 515 million and 521 million in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelythe following table summarizes our property as of december 31 2014 and 2013millions of dollars 2014 2013 estimated useful

we retired approximately 503 million and 282 million of machinery and equipment no longer in use during 2014 and 2013 respectively net gains and losses recognized in cost of products sold were not material for 2014 2013 and 2012we record impairment losses on longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts there were no significant impairments recorded during 2014 2013 and 2012goodwill and other intangibleswe evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment testif the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwillwe evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative testwhen the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected

challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 204 million brazilian reais approximately 78 million as of december 31 2014 reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these mattersin 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled in our case finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2014 our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 178 million brazilian reais approximately 67 million as of december 31 2014 we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2014in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million brazilian reais approximately 28 million as of december 31 2014 paid in 30 monthly installments from december 2013in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other befiex matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positionslitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period52notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedother litigationwe are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment product liability claims and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of many of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product liability claims fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our consolidated financial statements other mattersin 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in france the investigation includes 11 manufacturers including the whirlpool and indesit operations in france although it is currently not possible to assess the impact if any this matter

for at fair value based on market rates derivatives where we elect hedge accounting are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges derivatives that are not accounted for based on hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the fair value of the hedge does not offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earningsusing derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract we generally deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties the amount of counterparty credit exposure is limited to the unrealized gains if any on such derivative contracts we do not require nor do we post collateral or security on such contracts54notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedhedging strategyin the normal course of business we manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations including those arising from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition we use a variety of strategies including the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesforeign currency exchange rate riskwe incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from crosscurrency sales of products as a result we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencieswe enter into certain undesignated nonfunctional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to shortterm payables receivables and intercompany loans these forecasted crosscurrency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements royalty agreements and dividends when we hedge a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable with a derivative the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rates are reflected currently in interest and sundry income expense for both the payablereceivable and the derivative therefore as a result of the economic hedge we do not elect hedge accountingcommodity price riskwe enter into commodity derivative contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process the objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of commoditiesinterest rate riskwe may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure our interest rate swap agreements if any effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis these agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts respectively over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts we also may utilize a crosscurrency interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure relating to certain intercompany debt denominated in one foreign currency that will be repaid in another foreign currency at december 31 2014 and 2013 there were no outstanding swap agreementswe may enter into treasury rate lock agreements to effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by lockingin interest rates on probable longterm debt issuances55notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedthe following tables summarize our outstanding

are weighted by the targeted asset allocations the resulting weightedaverage return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percentfor foreign pension plans the expected rate of return on plan

orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we manage the process and approve the results of a third party pricing service to value the majority of our securities and to determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy 68notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedthe fair values of our pension plan assets at december 31 2014 and 2013 by
