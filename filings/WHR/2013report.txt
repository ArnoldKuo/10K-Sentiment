fullservice distributors to a large network of retail stores3competitioncompetition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier kenmore lg  mabe and samsung moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our markets is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our global footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measuresraw materials and purchased componentswe are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated cost pressure has been experienced during 2012 in some areas such as base metals and plastic resins supply constraints due to environment impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecast production schedulestrademarks licenses and patentswe consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid amana and acros the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool bauknecht and ignis in latin america the most important trademarks are consul brastemp whirlpool and kitchenaid the most important trademark to asia is whirlpool we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid jennair and amana brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologiesresearch and developmentexpenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 553 million 578 million and 532 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectivelyprotection of the environmentour manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibilitywe believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries that we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2012 and are not expected to be material in 2013the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards will be phased in over the next several years and include the general phaseout of ozone depleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulationsstate and federal environmental protection agencies have notified us of our possible involvement in a number of superfund sites in the united states however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters4other informationfor information about the challenges and risks associated with our foreign operations

and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the followingrisks relating to our businesswe face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as electrolux lg samsung bosch siemens panasonic and general electric are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover the united states customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms in the past our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affectedthe loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea alno major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demands requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot best buy casas bahia ikea alno major buying groups or builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products higher unemployment rates higher fuel and other energy costs higher deficit spending and debt levels and higher tax rates adversely affect demand a decline in economic activity and conditions in the united states brazil europe and the other markets in which we operate has had an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations over the past few years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse affect we face inventory and other asset risk we writedown for product and component inventories that have become obsolete or exceed anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value although we believe our inventory and other asset related provisions are currently adequate no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results6          risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2012 we derived approximately 48 of our net sales from outside of north america which includes canada and mexico including 27 in latin america 16 in emea and 5 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the following changes in foreign country regulatory requirementsvarious importexport restrictions and the availability of required importexport licensesimposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barrierspolitical legal and economic instability and uncertaintyforeign currency exchange rate fluctuationschanges in foreign country tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax lawsinflationmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and antitrust lawswork stoppages and labor relationsdisruptions in the shipping of imported and exported productsgovernment price controlsextended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable andlimitations on the repatriation of earningsas a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa could have a material adverse effect on usterrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewherewe are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy  uncertain global economic conditions and slowing or negative growth in the united states europe and china along with continuing difficulties in the financial markets national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions including a potential fiscal cliff in the united states and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates the markets for our products depend largely on consumer spending and the availability of financing economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectivelyuncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risksif we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected7an inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements and accelerate our rate of innovation our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which it could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operationsin addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affectedfluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel oil plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances these inflationary costs are expected to have a material impact in 2013 largely driven by increases in the cost of plastic resins and base metals such as copper aluminum zinc and nickel as well as component parts continued significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating resultsunfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks including litigation concerning products intellectual property rights taxes environmental matters commercial matters and compliance with competition laws and sales and trading practices results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty regardless of merit litigation may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and cause significant diversion of management attention and expense for which no insurance is likely available we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reservesproduct liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance so any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flows8we regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationswe are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions government regulators in various jurisdictions are currently investigating alleged pricing practices in the global compressor industry including our embraco compressor business headquartered in brazil in addition we have been named as a defendant in related lawsuits in various jurisdictions which seek damages in connection with the pricing of compressors and additional lawsuits may be filed the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operationsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitivenesswe have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performancemoreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products           the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities including our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risks in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages intellectual property claims against suppliers hazards such as fire earthquake flooding or other natural disasters such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance          significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan9as of december 31 2012 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 21 billion 16 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 05 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health care benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses          we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breachin addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee morale                our information systems could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assetsa deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 68000 employees of those employees various labor unions with separate collective bargaining agreements represent approximately 50 our current collective bargaining agreements generally have three year terms due to the large number of collective bargaining agreements we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees we may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operationschanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our

regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect us10new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and may make our supply chain more complex in august 2012 the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals known as conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries in their products these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in 2013 with initial disclosure requirements beginning in 2014 there will be significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposureitem 1bunresolved staff commentsnone11item 2propertiesour principal executive offices are

flow and the appropriate mix of longterm and shortterm debt by diversifying the maturity structure we avoid concentrations of debt reducing liquidity risk we have varying needs for shortterm working

spending to support innovation and productivity initiatives funding our pension plans and term debt liabilities return to shareholders and potential acquisitions in our core business andor strategic adjacent business opportunities these priorities are aligned with our goal to return our credit ratings to prerecession levels we have continued to operate under uncertain and volatile global economic conditions for most of 2012 experiencing higher material costs recessionary demand levels in developed markets and slowing growth in certain emerging markets we believe that operating cash flow together with access to sufficient sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our ongoing requirements to fund our operations our short term potential uses of liquidity include funding 600 million

exposure by counterparty we continue to monitor the general financial instability and uncertainty throughout europe at december 31 2012 we had cash cash equivalents and thirdparty receivables of approximately 160 million in italy and 310 million in belgium which were the only countries in europe with exposures for cash cash equivalents and third party receivables greater than 1 of our

alno is taking steps to strengthen their equity base and reduce their longterm debt during the fourth quarter 2012 alno issued 44 million additional shares at a per share price of euro 105 the proceeds of which were used to retire all of alnos bank debt upon completion of the share issuance we increased our ownership in alno from 1825 to 3058 while the share subscription is a significant

provided by operations during 2011 reflects a 301 million payment related to the settlement of the brazilian collection dispute funding of our united states qualified pension plans of 298 million and lower net earnings partially offset by significant reductions in inventory the timing of cash flows from operations varies significantly within a quarter primarily due to changes in production levels sales patterns promotional programs funding requirements as well as receivable and payment terms dependent on timing of cash flows the location of cash balances as well as the liquidity requirements of each country external sources of funding are used to support working capital requirements throughout the year due to the variables discussed above cash flow used in operations during the year may significantly exceed our quarter and yearend balancesduring the first quarter of 2011 the european parliament approved a directive that changes existing laws regarding supplier payment terms the approved directive generally requires payment terms to be 30 days from the invoice date unless otherwise stated in the contract an extension of up to 60 days is allowed if both parties agree to the terms countries within the european union are required to adopt this directive within 2 years we continue to monitor this situation as these changes once adopted could negatively affect our cash flows to suppliers and from customers since our payment terms to affected suppliers are generally longer than from affected customers we offer our suppliers access to third party payables processors

institutionscash flows from investing activitiescash used in investing activities of 494 million during 2012 decreased 102 million from 2011 primarily driven by lower capital investment due to project timing and the completion of a significant investment in a new cooking facility in the united states during 2011 cash used in investing activities during 2011 was 596 million which was consistent with cash used during 2010 reflecting continued capital spending to support new products and innovation cash flows from financing activitiescash used in financing activities during 2012 decreased compared

assets and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we

taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is madeas of december 31 2012 and 2011 we had total deferred tax assets of 31 billion and 28 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 130 million and 208 million respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million to the current year tax expense of 133 million and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including the reinstatement of the us energy tax credit legislation in january 2013 remaining

to the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangiblescertain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinite lived intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2012 we have goodwill of 1727 million mostly recorded within our north america reporting unit there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units we have trademark assets in our north america and emea operating segments with a carrying value of 1470 million and 51 million respectively as of december 31 2012 during 2012 we voluntarily changed the date of our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets from november 30 to october 1 we determined that this change is preferable under the circumstances as the timing better aligns with the companys annual and longterm business planning cycle and financial reporting process the voluntary change in accounting principle was not made to delay accelerate or avoid an impairment chargegoodwill valuationswe evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment test in conducting a qualitative assessment the company analyzes a variety of events or factors that may influence the fair value of the reporting unit including but not limited to the results of prior quantitative tests performed changes in the carrying amount of the reporting unit actual and projected operating results relevant market data for both the company and its peer companies industry outlooks macroeconomic conditions liquidity changes in key personnel and the companys competitive position significant judgment is used to evaluate the totality of these events and factors to make the determination of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value if the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill evaluating goodwill  results and significant assumptions based on the favorable results of the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2012 there was no goodwill impairment charge recorded in 2012 f14managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedfor our north america reporting unit where the majority of our goodwill is held our qualitative assessment included a review of the events and factors outlined above significant weight was provided to the following factors as we determined that these items have the most significant impact on the fair value of this reporting unitoperating profit margins improved from 42 in 2011 to 88 in 2012 driven primarily by successful execution of the cost and capacity reduction plans announced during the fourth quarter 2011 and previously announced costbased price increases as well as our continued ability to deliver innovative and consumer relevant products to the marketplace the improvement in operating margins compared to the prior year assessment provides significant positive evidence for the qualitative assessmentwe experienced a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate in 2012 resulting from a decline in both the risk free rate and our company specific risk premium as we have structurally improved our operating model through successful execution of our cost and capacity reductions and implementation of costbased price increases based on prior year sensitivities this decrease would increase the fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 1 billion which provides significant positive evidence for the qualitative assessmentthe implied increases to the fair value of our north america reporting unit noted above are further supported by an increase in our overall market capitalization of approximately 25 billion or 65 as of october 1 2012 compared to the prior year assessment this increase was largely driven by the improved operating performance of the north america reporting unit intangible valuationswe evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative test  when the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value evaluating trademarks  results and significant assumptionswe performed a qualitative assessment for two trademarks with a combined carrying value of approximately 30 million our prior year quantitative test indicated that the fair value for each trademark exceeded its respective carrying value by more than 200 based on the qualitative assessment conducted on october 1 2012 we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of these two trademarks was greater than their respective carrying values therefore no impairment was recordedwe performed a quantitative test for our remaining trademarks based on the results of our test as of october 1 2012 we determined that no impairment existed for our trademarks with the exception of one european trademark with a preimpairment carrying value of 14 million we recognized a 4 million impairment charge on this trademark within selling general and administrative expense during the fourth quarter 2012 in performing the quantitative test significant assumptions used in our relief from royalty model as of october 1 2012 included revenue growth rates assumed royalty rates and the discount rate which are discussed further below  revenue growth rates relate to projected revenues from our annual long range plan and vary from brand to brand adverse changes in the operating environment for the appliance industry or our inability to grow revenues at the forecasted rates may result in a future impairment charge we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues would result in an impairment of approximately 95 millionin determining royalty rates for the valuation of our trademarks we considered factors that affect the intrinsic royalty rates that would hypothetically be paid for the use of the trademark the most significant factors in determining the intrinsic royalty rates include the overall role and importance of the trademarks in the particular industry the profitability of the products utilizing the trademarks and the position of the trademarked products in a given market segment based on this analysis we determined royalty rates of 23 for our value brands 4 for our mass market brands and 6 for our super premium brand we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 100 basis point reduction of the royalty rates for each brand would result in an impairment of approximately 290 millionf15managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedin developing discount rates for the valuation of our trademarks we used the industry average weighted average cost of capital as the base adjusted for the higher relative level of risks associated with doing business in other countries as applicable as well as the higher relative levels of risks associated with intangible assets based on this analysis we determined discount rates ranging from 95 to 130 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that an increase in the discount rates used for the valuation of 100 basis points would result in an impairment of approximately 125 millionmany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairmentsfor additional information about goodwill and intangible valuations see

been recorded within interest and sundry income expense at december 31 2012 111 million remains accrued with installment payments of 73 million plus interest remaining to be made to government authorities at various times through 2015 we continue to work toward resolution of ongoing government actions in other jurisdictions to defend the related antitrust lawsuits and to take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operationsbrazilian collection disputewe reached an agreement in june 2011 to settle all claims arising from our longstanding dispute in brazil with banco safra sa such settlement was subsequently approved by a brazilian court in july 2011 pursuant to the settlement our subsidiary agreed to pay banco safra sa 959 million  brazilian reais in two installments the first of 469 million reais equivalent to 301 million was made in july 2011 and the second of 490 million reais equivalent to 275 million was made during january 2012 befiex creditsin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales after a favorable court decision in 2005 upheld by a december 2011 appellate court decision we were able to recognize approximately 37 million 266 million and 225 million of export credits in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we recognize export credits as they are monetized however future actions by the brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits as of december 31 2012 approximately 184 million of future cash monetization remained including 56 million of related court awarded fees which will be payable in subsequent yearsour brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 12 billion brazilian reais equivalent to 590 millionlitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodf17managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedbrazil tax matters previously operating tax matterrelying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a special brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received a tax assessment of 178 million brazilian reais equivalent to 87 million in january 2013 reflecting the original assessment plus interest and penalties we are disputing this assessment and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on our analysis of the facts including the opinion of our legal advisors we did not record additional charges related to these matters in 2012we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters these matters are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings we routinely assess these matters and record our best estimate of loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss to be probable we believe these assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions however each of these matters may take several years to resolve and the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictableother litigationwe are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states and various jurisdictions in canada relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek unspecified compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statementsin addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product defect fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our consolidated financial statements antidumping actionsin march 2011 we filed antidumping and countervailing duty petitions against bottommount refrigerators from south korea and an antidumping petition against the same product from mexico the whirlpool products affected by this case are made in amana iowa where whirlpool employs approximately 2200 people in march 2012 the us department of commerce doc issued favorable final determinations in which it found that several korean and mexican producers had engaged in dumping and that certain korean producers received countervailable government subsidies in april 2012 the us international trade commission itc reached an unfavorable final determination that dumped and subsidized imports were not a cause of material injury to domestic producers and therefore trade remedies were not imposed on the subject imports we disagree with the itcs decision and we have filed an appeal with the us court of international trade timing of the ultimate resolution depends on many factors and is therefore uncertainf18managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedin december 2011 we filed petitions requesting that the doc and the itc initiate antidumping and countervailing duty investigations against large residential washers from south korea and an antidumping investigation against the same products from mexico the whirlpool products affected by this case are made in clyde ohio where whirlpool employs approximately 3500 people in december 2012 the doc issued a final determination in which it found that several korean and mexican producers had engaged in dumping and that certain korean producers received countervailable government subsidies in january 2013 the itc unanimously determined that dumped and subsidized imports caused material injury to domestic producers final orders are expected to be issued by the doc in february 2013 as a result certain korean and mexican producers are required to pay cash deposits on large residential washers imported into the united states based on the estimated dumping and countervailing duty margins determined by the doc in the investigation the ultimate amount of dumping and countervailing duties owed by importers will be determined by the doc through administrative review procedures over the next several years conflict mineralsin august 2012 the sec issued final rules requiring disclosure of the use of conflict

segments which consist of north america latin america emea europe middle east and africa and asia our consolidated financial statements include all majorityowned subsidiaries all intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidationreclassificationswe reclassified certain prior period amounts in our consolidated financial statements to be consistent with current period presentation the effect of these reclassifications is not materialuse of estimateswe are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from those estimatesrevenue recognitionsales are recorded when title passes to the customer as determined by the shipping terms for the majority of our sales title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped for a portion of our sales title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customers location allowances for estimated returns are made on sales of certain products based on historical return rates for the products involvedaccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accountswe carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances credit conditions and the history of writeoffs and collections we evaluate items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable writeoffs in general our policy is to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due a receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within agreed upon invoice termsfreight and warehousing costswe classify freight and warehousing costs within cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of incomecash and equivalentsall highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalentsfair value measurementswe measure fair value based on an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we had no level 3 assets or liabilities at december 31 2012 and 2011we measured fair value for money market funds and available for sale investments using quoted market prices in active markets for identical or comparable assets we measured fair value for derivative contracts all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings based on model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from observable market data inventoriesinventories are stated at firstin firstout fifo cost except united states production inventories which are stated at lastin firstout lifo cost and latin america and asia inventories which are stated at average cost costs do not exceed net realizable values see note 4 for additional information about inventoriesf26notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedpropertyproperty is stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation for production machinery and equipment we record depreciation based on units produced unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straightline method for nonproduction assets we depreciate costs based on the straightline method depreciation expense for property including accelerated depreciation classified as restructuring expense in our consolidated statements of income was 521 million 530 million and 527 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectivelythe following table summarizes

consolidated statements of income we retired approximately 558 million  and 600 million of machinery and equipment no longer in use during 2012 and 2011 respectively net gains and losses recognized in cost of products sold were not material for 2012 2011 and 2010 we record impairment losses on longlived assets excluding goodwill and intangibles when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the estimated future cash flows generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts there were no significant impairments recorded during 2012 2011 and 2010goodwill and other intangibleswe evaluate goodwill using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value of the reporting unit may be less than its carrying amount we evaluate goodwill using a twostep impairment test otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the twostep impairment testif the qualitative assessment concludes that the twostep impairment test is necessary we first compare the book value of a reporting unit including goodwill with its fair value the fair value is estimated based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow analysis also known as the income approach and is reconciled back to the current market capitalization for whirlpool to ensure that the implied control premium is reasonable if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we perform the second step to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets the difference between the total fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of all the assets and liabilities other than goodwill is the implied fair value of that goodwill the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the book value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwillwe evaluate certain indefinitelived intangibles using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount if we determine that the fair value may be less than its carrying amount the fair value of the trademark is estimated and compared to its carrying value to determine if an impairment exists otherwise we conclude that no impairment is indicated and we do not perform the quantitative test when the qualitative assessment is not utilized and a quantitative test is performed we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademarks and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying valuedefinite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life see note 2 for additional information about goodwill and intangible assetsf27notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedaccounts payable outsourcingwe offer our suppliers access to third party payables processors independent of whirlpool the processors allow suppliers to sell their receivables to financial institutions at the sole discretion of both the supplier and the financial institution we have no economic interest in the sale of these receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services all of our obligations including amounts due remain to our suppliers as stated in our supplier agreements as of december 31 2012 and 2011 approximately 12 billion and 10 billion respectively have been sold by suppliers to participating financial institutionsderivative financial instrumentswe use derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges to manage our exposure to the volatility in material costs foreign currency and interest rates on certain debt instruments changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities ie gains or losses are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated for those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as a cash flow hedge fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation for a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings for a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings see note 7 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial instrumentsforeign currency translationforeign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates translation adjustments resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in net earningsresearch and development costsresearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and totaled 553 million 578

235 million in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectivelyincome taxeswe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets is recognized in income in the period of enactment datewe recognize in other current and noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not based on technical merits that the position will be sustained upon examination we accrue for other tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated provision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested see note 11 for additional information about income taxesf28notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedstock based compensationwe recognize stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award generally the vesting period the fair value of stock options is determined using the blackscholes optionpricing model which incorporates assumptions regarding the riskfree interest rate expected volatility expected option life and dividend yield stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the stock price on the date of grant the fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units is generally based on the closing market price of whirlpool common stock on the grant date see note 9 for additional information about stock based compensationbefiex creditsin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduce brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales we recognize export credits as they are monetized however future actions by the brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits see note 11 for additional information regarding befiex credits new accounting pronouncementson january 1 2012 we adopted the provisions of an amendment to accounting standards codification asc 220 comprehensive income this amendment requires companies to present in annual statements the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements it eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity in addition in december 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to this accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement the amendments affect only the display of information and do not change existing recognition and measurement requirements in our consolidated financial statementsin july 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other under the amendment an entity may assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinitelived

longterm debt under the agreement alno issued 44 million additional shares during the fourth quarter 2012 at a per share price of euro 105 the proceeds from the share issuance were used to retire all of alnos bank debt in addition we were required to subscribe for all shares for which we were entitled and also agreed to acquire any additional unsubscribed shares as may be necessary to yield minimum gross proceeds to alno of eur 462 million upon completion of the share issuance we increased our ownership interest from 1825 to 3058 for 18 million this transaction resulted in a change of accounting method from the cost method to the equity method during the fourth quarter 2012 under the equity method of accounting we are required to record our proportionate share of net earnings or losses in alno for each period of ownership we did not adjust prior period financial statements or information as the impact of the change in accounting method was not material to any individual year accordingly during the fourth quarter 2012 we recorded a reduction to retained earnings of 18 million to reflect the cumulative impact from the change in accounting method had we applied the impact of the change in accounting method to prior periods we would have increased net earnings by approximately 6 million and 1 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively at december 31

matters beginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions in 2012 embraco sales represented approximately 8 of our global net salesgovernment authorities in brazil europe the united states and other jurisdictions have entered into agreements with embraco and concluded their investigations of the company in connection with these agreements embraco has acknowledged violations of antitrust law with respect to the sale of compressors at various times from 2004 through 2007 and agreed to pay fines or settlement payments since the government investigations commenced in february 2009 embraco has been named as a defendant in related antitrust lawsuits in various jurisdictions seeking damages in connection with the pricing of compressors from 1996 to 2009 several other compressor manufacturers who are the subject of the government investigations have also been named as defendants in the antitrust lawsuits united states federal lawsuits instituted on behalf of purported direct and indirect purchasers and containing class action allegations have been combined in one proceeding in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan michigan lawsuit other lawsuits are also pending and additional lawsuits may be filed by purported purchasers f32notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedon february 12 2013 embraco entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs representing a proposed settlement class of direct purchasers of compressors in the michigan lawsuit the settlement agreement which is subject to court approval provides for among other things the payment by embraco of up to 30 million in exchange for a release by all settlement class members the settlement agreement does not cover any claims by direct purchasers that opt out of the proposed settlement class and the settlement amount will be reduced if there are optouts the settlement agreement does not cover claims by indirect purchaser plaintiffs in the michigan lawsuit which remain pendingin connection with these agreements and other embraco antitrust matters we have incurred in the aggregate charges of approximately 357 million including fines defense costs and other expenses these charges have been recorded within interest and sundry income expense at december 31 2012 111 million remains accrued with installment payments of 73 million plus interest remaining to be made to government authorities at various times through 2015 we continue to work toward resolution of ongoing government actions in other jurisdictions to defend the related antitrust lawsuits and to take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operationsbrazilian collection disputewe reached an agreement in june 2011 to settle all claims arising from our longstanding dispute in brazil with banco safra sa such settlement was subsequently approved by a brazilian court in july 2011 pursuant to the settlement our subsidiary agreed to pay banco safra sa 959 million brazilian reais in two installments the first of 469 million reais equivalent to 301 million was made in july 2011 and the second of 490 million reais equivalent to 275 million was made in january 2012 brazil tax matters previously operating tax matterrelying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a special brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received a tax assessment of 178 million brazilian reais equivalent to 87 million in january 2013 reflecting the original assessment plus interest and penalties we are disputing this assessment and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on our analysis of the facts including the opinion of our legal advisors we did not record additional charges related to these matters in 2012we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters these matters are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings we routinely assess these matters and record our best estimate of loss in situations where we assess the likelihood of an ultimate loss to be probable we believe these assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positions however each of these matters may take several years to resolve and the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictableother litigationwe are currently defending against numerous lawsuits pending in federal and state courts in the united states and various jurisdictions in canada relating to certain of our front load washing machines some of these lawsuits have been certified for treatment as class actions the complaints in these lawsuits generally allege violations of state consumer fraud acts unjust enrichment and breach of warranty the complaints generally seek unspecified compensatory consequential and punitive damages we believe these suits are without merit and are vigorously defending them given the preliminary stage of these proceedings the company cannot reasonably estimate a possible range of loss if any at this time the resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statementsf33notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedin addition we are currently defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations these lawsuits allege claims which include breach of contract breach of warranty product defect fraud violation of federal and state consumer protection acts and negligence we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our

hedges and derivative financial instruments derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value based on market rates derivatives where we elect hedge accounting are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges derivatives that are not accounted for based on hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the fair value of the hedge does not offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earningsusing derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract we generally deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties the amount of counterparty credit exposure is limited to the unrealized gains if any on such derivative contracts we do not require nor do we post collateral or security on such contractshedging strategyin the normal course of business we manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations including those arising from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition we use a variety of strategies including the use of derivative instruments we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesf35notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedforeign currency exchange rate riskwe incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from crosscurrency sales of products as a result we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencieswe enter into certain undesignated nonfunctional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to shortterm payables receivables inventory and intercompany loans these forecasted crosscurrency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements royalty agreements and dividends when we hedge a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable with a derivative the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rates are reflected currently in interest and sundry income expense for both the payablereceivable and the derivative therefore as a result of the economic hedge we do not elect hedge accountingcommodity price riskwe enter into swap and option contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process the objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of commoditiesinterest rate riskwe may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure our interest rate swap agreements if any effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis these agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts respectively over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts we also may utilize a crosscurrency interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure relating to certain intercompany debt denominated in one foreign currency that will be repaid in another foreign currency at december 31 2012 and 2011 there were no outstanding swap agreementswe may enter into treasury rate lock

energy efficient products that meet these standards for our customers f42notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedforeign government tax incentivesin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales after a favorable court decision in 2005 upheld by a december 2011 appellate court decision we were able to recognize approximately 37 million 266 million and 225 million of export credits in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively we recognize export credits as they are monetized however future actions by the brazilian government could limit our ability to monetize these export credits as of december 31 2012 approximately 184 million of future cash monetization remained including 56 million of related court awarded fees which will be payable in subsequent yearsour brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 12 billion brazilian reais equivalent to 590 millionlitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve during which time the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodsettlement of global tax auditswe are in various stages of audits by certain governmental tax authorities we establish liabilities for the difference between tax return provisions and the benefits recognized in our financial statements such amounts represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid and may need to be adjusted over time as more information becomes known we are no longer subject to any significant united states federal state local or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2000united states tax on foreign dividendswe have historically reinvested all unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates we plan to distribute approximately 184 million of foreign earnings over the next several years this distribution is forecasted to result in tax benefits which have not been recorded because of their contingent nature there has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of 33 billion at december 31 2012 as of december 31 2012 we had 12 billion of cash and equivalents on hand of which 08 billion was held outside of the united states our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united state taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries it is not practicable to estimate the

research the expected returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations the resulting weightedaverage return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percentfor foreign pension plans the

an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we manage the process and approve the results of a third party pricing service to value the majority of our
