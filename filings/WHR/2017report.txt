kitchenaid amana bauknecht jennair diqua and royalstar brand names through a combination of direct sales to appliance retailers and chain stores and through fullservice distributors to a large network of retail stores competitioncompetition in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product and service offerings expanding our regional footprint and trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measuresraw materials and purchased componentswe are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship was abruptly interrupted or terminated in the event of a disruption we believe that we will be able to qualify and use alternate materials sometimes at premium costs and that such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedulestrademarks licenses and patentswe consider the trademarks copyrights patents and trade secrets we own and the licenses we hold in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important trademarks to north america are whirlpool maytag jennair kitchenaid amana and acros the most important trademarks to latin america are consul brastemp whirlpool and kitchenaid the most important trademarks to emea are whirlpool kitchenaid bauknecht indesit hotpoint hotpointariston and ignis the most important trademarks to asia are whirlpool royalstar and diqua we receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture sell and service certain products bearing the whirlpool maytag kitchenaid and amana brand names we continually apply for and obtain united states and foreign patents the primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologiesresearch and developmentexpenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately 604 million 579 million and 563 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectivelyprotection of the environmentour manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibilitywhirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas4we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations did not have a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2016 and is not expected to be material in 2017the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration and energy standards for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulationswhirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings financial condition or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection mattersacquisitionswhirlpool chinaon october 24 2014 whirlpools whollyowned subsidiary whirlpool china investment co ltd completed its acquisition of a 51 equity stake in hefei rongshida sanyo

projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances including any underlying assumptions are forwardlooking statements those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statementswe have listed below the most significant strategic operational financial and legal and compliance risks relating to our business strategic riskskey risk risk descriptionwe face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete could negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux haier lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affectedthe loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts allowing trade customers to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to our key trade customers major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operations7failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of our company or any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operationsin addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns inaccurate or negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affectedan inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business objectives including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and drive shareholder value our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing marketsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets and the licenses we hold to be a significant part and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitivenesswe have applied for intellectual property protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products design patents product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any similar authority in other jurisdictions will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged or invalidated others could design around our patents or the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performancemoreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements or modify our products or services we also may be subject to significant damages injunctions against development and sale of certain products or services or limited in the use of our brands8operational riskskey risk risk descriptionwe face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets from time to time we make strategic acquisitions investments and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy productsour growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us or our compliance policies which noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations9risks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2016 international operations represent approximately 54 of our net sales including 25 in emea 16 in latin america 7 in asia 4 in canada and 2 in mexico we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the followingpolitical legal and economic instability and uncertaintyforeign currency exchange rate fluctuationschanges in foreign tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates  and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax lawschanges in diplomatic and trade relationships including sanctions resulting from the current  political situation in countries in which we do businessinflation andor deflationchanges in foreign country regulatory requirementsvarious importexport restrictions and disruptions and the availability of required  importexport licensesimposition of tariffs and other trade barriersmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as  compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the  fcpa and antitrust lawslabor disputes and work stoppages at our operations and suppliers government price controlsthe inability to collect accounts receivable andlimitations on the repatriation or movement of earnings and cashas a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on usterrorist attacks armed conflicts civil unrest natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customerswe may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breachin addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if these service providers do not perform effectively we may not achieve the expected cost savings and may incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee moraleour information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting or corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business10productrelated liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we may be exposed to productrelated liabilities which in some instances may result in product redesigns product recalls or other corrective action in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we maintain product liability insurance but it may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available a cost effective market for product recall insurance does not exist so any product recall we initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flowswe regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as appropriate we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances currently we are implementing a corrective action plan affecting certain of our indesit and hotpoint branded dryers see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters actual costs of these and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne by whirlpool or the supplier and if borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsthe ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products which come from numerous suppliers because not all of our business arrangements provide for guaranteed supply and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary components for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and those of our suppliers are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue andor earnings performanceour ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us significant time is required to hire and develop skilled replacement personnel an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operationsa deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2016 we had approximately 93000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we periodically negotiate with certain unions representing our employees and may be subject to work stoppages or may be unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all all of which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationswhirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas11financial riskskey risk risk descriptionfluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the sources and prices of the primary materials such as steel resins and base metals used to manufacture our products and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant global and regional price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations such as conflict mineral provisions and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating resultsforeign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in foreign currencies changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards net investment hedges and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposurewe face inventory and other asset risk we write down product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results12we are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain and changing economic conditions within our regions along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates a number of economic factors including gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our productseconomic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or added costs in addition these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by or consolidation of other appliance manufacturers which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectivelya decline in economic activity and conditions in certain areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in countries in which we do business may adversely affect business conditions disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital marketsif we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affectedsignificant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees around the world we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution planas of december 31 2016 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 15 billion 11 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 04 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future

calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid by whirlpool to acquire majority control of hefei sanyo in 2014 and which are used to fund capital

handwe monitor the credit ratings and market indicators of credit risk of our lending depository and derivative counterparty banks regularly and take certain action to manage credit risk we diversify our deposits and investments in short term cash equivalents to limit the concentration of exposure by counterparty as of december 31 2016 the only country where we had cash or cash equivalents greater

conditions globallythe company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 11 billion at december 31 2016 of which approximately 10 billion was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries for each of its foreign subsidiaries the company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted

subsidiary guarantees customer lines of credit at commercial banks to support purchases following its normal credit policies if a customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 the guaranteed amounts totaled 258 million and 260 million respectively the fair value of these guarantees were nominal at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters we had no losses associated with these guarantees in 2016 or 2015 we have guaranteed a 40 million fiveyear

originated in 2008 was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 it was also amended in 2015 and reduced from 43 million to 40 million by harbor shores in 2016 the fair value of this guarantee was nominal at december 31 2016 and december 31 2015 the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of default in the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had approximately 327 million and 290 million outstanding under these agreements respectivelycritical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates28managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continued pension and other postretirement benefitsaccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those key assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expenseour pension and other postretirement benefit obligations

consolidated financial statementsincome taxeswe estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences that are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is madeas of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had total deferred tax assets of 32 billion and 33 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 150 million and 286 million respectively our income tax expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from 133 million in 2012 to 186 million in the current year the tax expense has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits foreign tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits

investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit these dryer production platforms were developed prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint and indesit brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit producedas of december 31 2016 whirlpool had 162 million of cash expenditures related to the corrective action we expect the corrective action affecting these dryers to have future cash expenditures in 2017 of 69 million  for additional information about the legacy product corrective action see note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementswarranty obligationsthe estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for

recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill primarily whirlpools trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinitelife intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2016 we had goodwill of approximately 30 billion there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for the impact of foreign currency we primarily have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a total carrying value of approximately 26 billion as of december 31 2016 we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist in 2016 the company primarily elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinitelife intangible assets goodwill valuationsin performing a quantitative assessment we estimate each reporting units fair value using the income approach the income approach uses operating segments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions the projection uses managements best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales costs and number of units estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements the estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying valueswhirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in the emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas30managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedadditionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values of fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting units operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactionsif actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the companys financial statementsbased on the results of our quantitative assessment conducted on october 1 2016 the fair values of whirlpools reporting units continue to exceed their respective carrying values the range by which the excess fair value of our reporting units goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 4 to 142 the emea reporting unit has excess fair value of 4 during the fourth quarter 2014 whirlpool acquired indesit resulting in substantially all of the goodwill included in this reporting unit the range by which the excess fair value of our remaining reporting units goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 70 to 142other intangible valuationsin performing a quantitative assessment of indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill primarily trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment lossthree trademarks acquired in fourth quarter of 2014 have fair values that exceed their carrying values by less than 10 the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying values by more than 10 with the exception of one north american trademark the fair value of this north american trademark exceeded its carrying value of approximately 1 billion by 6 in 2016 and 5 in 2015 we expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we continue to execute specific brand investments and product development plans additionally we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues a 50 basis point decrease in royalty rate or a 50 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an impairment ranging from approximately 22 million to 78 millionif actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions trademarks or other indefinitelife intangible assets may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the companys financial results of operationsbased on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge of approximately 12 million in 2014our assessment indicates no impairment of any trademarks as of december 31 2016for additional information about

principles of consolidationthe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and include all majorityowned subsidiaries all material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation we do not consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have an ownership interest of 50 or less unless that company is deemed to be a variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary certain vies are consolidated when the company is the primary beneficiary of these entities and has the ability to directly impact the activities of these entities and have a nominal effect on the companys resultsreclassificationswe reclassified certain prior period amounts in our consolidated financial statements to be consistent with current period presentation use of estimateswe are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the most significant assumptions are estimates in determining the fair value of intangible assets legal contingencies income taxes and pension and postretirement benefits actual results could differ materially from those estimatesrevenue recognitionsales are recognized when revenue is realized or realizable and has been earned revenue is recognized when the sales price is determinable and the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer as determined by the shipping terms for the majority of our sales title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped for a portion of our sales title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customers location sales are net of allowances for product returns which are based on historical return rates and certain promotionsaccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accountswe carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances credit conditions and the history of writeoffs and collections we evaluate items on an individual basis when determining accounts receivable writeoffs in general our policy is to not charge interest on trade receivables after the invoice becomes past due a receivable is considered past due if payment has not been received within agreed upon invoice termsfreight and warehousing costswe classify freight and warehousing costs within cost of products sold in our consolidated statements of incomecash and cash equivalentsall highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an initial maturity of three months or

million respectively approximately 45 million and 48 million is recorded in other current assets as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively with the remaining portion recorded in other noncurrent assetsfair value measurementswe measure fair value based on an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we had no level 3 assets or liabilities at december 31 2016 and 2015 with the exception of those disclosed in note 12we measured fair value for money market funds and available for sale investments using quoted market prices in active markets for identical or comparable assets we measured fair value for derivative contracts all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings based on model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from observable market data for assets measured at net asset

record depreciation based on units produced unless units produced drop below a minimum threshold at which point depreciation is recorded using the straightline method excluding property acquired from the hefei sanyo acquisition and certain property acquired from the indesit acquisition for nonproduction assets and assets acquired from hefei sanyo and certain production assets acquired from indesit

assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist in 2016 the company primarily elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and certain indefinitelife intangible assetsgoodwillin performing a quantitative assessment of goodwill we estimate each reporting units fair value using fair value using the best information available to us including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach the income approach uses reporting units projections of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital which that is determined based on current market conditions additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach we performed our assessment as of october 1 2016 and determined there was no impairment of goodwillother intangible assetswe perform a quantitative assessment of other indefinite life intangible assets which are primarily comprised of trademarks we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which primarily requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital we performed our assessment as of october 1 2016 and determined there was no impairments of indefinite life intangible assetsother definite life intangible assets are amortized over their useful life and are assessed for

instruments changes in the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities ie gains or losses are recognized depending upon the type of hedging relationship and whether a hedge has been designated for those derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged as a cash flow hedge fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation for a derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the period of change in fair value together with the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings for a derivative instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income loss as part of the cumulative translation adjustment changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in current net earnings see note 7 for additional information about hedges and derivative financial

standardsin november 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201517 income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes which supersedes the guidance in topic 740 income taxes that requires an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities and assets into a current amount and noncurrent amount in a classified statement of financial position the amendment requires entities that present a classified balance sheet to classify all deferred tax liabilities and assets as a noncurrent amount this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 and may be early adopted on a prospective basis or on a retrospective basis to all periods presented on

deferred tax liabilities of approximately 19 million as of december 31 2015 the impact of this reclassification as of december 31 2016 has no impact on net income or cash flow and is comparable to

monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2016 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period has been subject to review by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits we are awaiting the resolution of additional proceedings on the retroactive effect of the reinstituted indexour brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with certain monetized befiex credits we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2016 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 18 billion brazilian reais approximately 541 million as of december 31 2016relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 232 million brazilian reais approximately 71 million as of december 31 2016 reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these matters in 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian 47notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedsupreme court ruled on one of our cases finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2016 our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 171 million brazilian reais approximately 52 million as of december 31 2016 we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2016in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positionslitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period other litigationwe have vigorously defended against numerous lawsuits pending in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines in 2016 we reached final agreement on a settlement that will resolve all such class action lawsuits except for attorneys fees in an immaterial case and received court approval we are proceeding through the administrative consumer claims process to implement the terms of the settlement which will be complete in 2017 in addition we are currently vigorously defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations and have and may become involved in similar actions in other jurisdictions these lawsuits allege claims which include negligence breach of contract breach of warranty product liability and safety claims false advertising fraud and violation of federal and state regulations including consumer protection laws in general we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation

to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required in september 2015 we recorded a liability related to this corrective action cost of 245 million approximately 274 million as of september 30 2015 approximately 90 of the affected units were manufactured by indesit prior to its acquisition by the company in october 2014 accordingly in september 2015 we increased the warranty liability as a purchase accounting adjustment in the opening balance sheet with a corresponding increase to goodwill of 210 million approximately 235 million as of september 30 2015 the establishment of this liability is based on several assumptions such as customer response rate consumer options field repair costs inventory repair costs and timing of tax deductibility our experience with respect to these factors may cause our actual costs to differ significantly from our estimated costs during 2015 we recognized expenses

instruments derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value based on market rates derivatives where we elect hedge accounting are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges derivatives that are not accounted for based on hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the fair value of the hedge does not offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earningsusing derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract we generally deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties the amount of counterparty credit exposure is limited to the unrealized gains if any on such derivative contracts we do not require nor do we post collateral or security on such contractshedging strategyin the normal course of business we manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations including those arising from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition we use a variety of strategies including the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes50notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedforeign currency exchange rate riskwe incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from crosscurrency sales of products as a result we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencieswe enter into certain undesignated nonfunctional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to shortterm payables receivables and intercompany loans these forecasted crosscurrency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements royalty agreements and dividends when we hedge a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable with a derivative the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rates are reflected currently in interest and sundry income expense for both the payablereceivable and the derivative therefore as a result of the economic hedge we do not elect hedge accountingcommodity price riskwe enter into commodity derivative contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process the objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of commoditiesinterest rate riskwe may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure our interest rate swap agreements if any effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis these agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts respectively over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts we also may utilize a crosscurrency interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure relating to certain intercompany debt denominated in one foreign currency that will be repaid in another foreign currency at december 31 2016 and 2015 there were no outstanding swap agreementswe may enter into treasury rate lock

between related controlled foreign corporations57notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedunited states tax on foreign dividendswe have historically reinvested all unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates we plan to distribute approximately 5 million of foreign earnings over the next several years this distribution is forecasted to result in tax benefits which have not been recorded because of their contingent nature there has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of 46 billion at december 31 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 11 billion at december 31 2016 of which approximately 10 billion was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculationvaluation allowancesat december 31 2016 we had net operating loss carryforwards of 35 billion 10 billion of which were

payments of federal income taxes expiring between 2017 and 2036we routinely review the future realization of deferred tax assets based on projected future reversal of taxable temporary differences available tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the net estimated amount of certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss and other deferred tax assets we believe will be realized our recorded valuation allowance of 150 million at december 31 2016 consists of 128 million of net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets and 22 million of other deferred tax assets our recorded valuation allowance was 286 million at december 31 2015 and consisted of 239 million of net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets and 47 million of other deferred tax assets the reduction in our valuation allowance includes 121 million recognized in net earnings which consist of 163 million of valuation allowance releases and 42 million of additional valuation allowances the remaining change relates to reclassification within our net deferred tax asset we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of existing deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances mentioned abovesettlement of global tax auditswe are in various stages of audits by certain governmental tax

have funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil for the united states plan which comprises the majority of our obligation the plans are frozen for the majority of participants the formula for united states salaried employees covered under the qualified defined benefit plan was based on years of service and final average salary while the formula for united states hourly employees covered under the defined benefit plans was based on specific dollar amounts for each year of service there were multiple formulas for employees covered under the qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans sponsored by maytag including a cash balance formula in addition we sponsor an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan this plan is nonqualified and provides certain key employees defined pension benefits that supplement those provided by the companys other retirement plans a defined contribution plan is being provided to all united states employees subsequent to the pension plan freezes and is not classified within the net periodic benefit cost the company provides annual match and automatic company contributions in cash or company stock of up to 7 of employees eligible pay our contributions during 2016 2015 and 2014 were 77 million 76 million and 71 million respectively we provide postretirement health care benefits for eligible retired employees in the united states canada and brazil for our united states plan which comprises the majority of our obligation eligible retirees include those who were fulltime employees with 10 years of service who attained age 55 while in service with us and those union retirees who met the eligibility requirements of their collective bargaining agreements in general the postretirement health and welfare benefit plans include costsharing provisions that limit our exposure for recent and future retirees and are contributory with participants contributions adjusted annually the plans are unfunded we reserve the right to modify these benefits in the future during the second quarter 2011 we modified retiree medical benefits for certain retirees to be consistent with those benefits provided by the whirlpool corporation group benefit plan we accounted for these changes as a plan amendment in 2011 resulting in a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation of 138 million of which approximately 104 million of benefit has been recognized in net earnings since 2011 with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in response a group of retirees initiated legal proceedings against whirlpool asserting the above benefits are vested and changes to the plan are not permitted we disagree with plaintiffs assertion and are continuing to vigorously defend our position including through any necessary appeal process however an unfavorable ruling in any particular reporting period could require us to immediately reverse the benefit we have recognized to that point and remeasure the associated postretirement benefit obligation the impact of which will depend on timing and the actuarial assumptions then in

the nearest quarter of one percent and applied to the fair value of plan assets as of december 31 2016for foreign pension plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was primarily determined by

amount that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we manage the process and approve the results of a third party
