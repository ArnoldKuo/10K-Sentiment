in the major home appliance industry is intense including competitors such as arcelik bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier kenmore lg mabe midea panasonic and samsung many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives these financial incentives include cooperative advertising comarketing funds salesperson incentives volume rebates and terms we believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products building strong brands enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings continuing to expand our regional footprint expanding trade distribution channels increasing productivity improving quality lowering costs and taking other efficiencyenhancing measuresraw materials and purchased componentswe are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business in areas where a single supplier is used alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials some of which were at premium costs we believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedulestrademarks licenses and patentswe consider the trademarks licenses and patents we own in the aggregate to be a valuable asset whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the united states and foreign countries the most important

were approximately 579 million 563 million and 582 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectivelyprotection of the environmentour manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment many of which require federal state or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges air emissions and hazardous waste management our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations where laws and regulations are less restrictive we have established and are following our own standards consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibilitywe believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures earnings or our competitive position during 2015 and is not expected to be material in 20164the entire major home appliance industry including whirlpool must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards these standards were phasedin over the past several years and include the general phaseout of ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives compliance with these various standards as they become effective will require some product redesign however we believe based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations that we will be able to develop manufacture and market products that comply with these regulationswhirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally these include operating and nonoperating facilities previously owned properties and waste sites including superfund comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla sites however based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings

uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict therefore actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forwardlooking statements these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to the followingrisks relating to our businesswe face intense competition in the major home appliance industry and failure to successfully compete may negatively affect our business and financial performance each of our operating segments operates in a highly competitive business environment and faces intense competition from a growing number of competitors many of which have strong consumer brand equity several of these competitors such as bosch siemens electrolux general electric haier lg panasonic and samsung are large wellestablished companies many ranking among the global fortune 150 and have demonstrated a commitment to success in the global market moreover our customer base includes large sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products services and prices competition in the global appliance market is based on a number of factors including selling price product features and design performance innovation reputation energy efficiency quality cost distribution and financial incentives such as cooperative advertising comarketing funds sales person incentives volume rebates and terms many of our competitors are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprints our competitors especially global competitors with lowcost sources of supply andor highly protected home markets outside the united states have aggressively priced their products andor introduced new products to increase market share and expand into new geographies if we are unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment our business and financial performance could be negatively affectedwe face risks associated with our acquisitions and other investments and risks associated with our increased presence in emerging markets from time to time we make strategic acquisitions and participate in joint ventures for example we acquired indesit and a majority interest in hefei sanyo in the fourth quarter of 2014 these transactions and other transactions that we have entered into or which we may enter into in the future can involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment we may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations applying our internal control processes to these acquisitions and in managing strategic investments integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management furthermore we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction while our evaluation of any potential acquisition includes business legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets legacy productsour growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets including through acquisitions local business practices in these countries may not comply with us laws local laws or other laws applicable to us if our compliance policies including the requirement to comply with all laws are not followed such noncompliant practices may result in increased liability risks for example we may incur unanticipated costs expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition targets violation of applicable laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa or similar worldwide antibribery laws in nonus jurisdictions we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses including postclosing asset impairment charges expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities litigation and other liabilities in addition our recent and future acquisitions may increase our exposure to other risks associated with operating internationally including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations political legal and economic instability inflation changes in tax rates and tax laws and work stoppages and labor relations see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the hefei sanyo and indesit acquisitions7the loss of or substantial decline in sales to any of our key trade customers which include lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups and builders could adversely affect our financial performance we sell to a sophisticated customer base of large trade customers that have significant leverage as buyers over their suppliers most of our products are not sold through longterm contracts which facilitates the trade customers ability to change volume among suppliers as the trade customers continue to become larger they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability by various means including improved efficiency lower pricing and increased promotional programs if we are unable to meet their demand requirements our volume growth and financial results could be negatively affected the loss of or substantial decline in volume of sales to lowes sears home depot hhgregg best buy gpa  grupo pão de açúcar ikea alno suning major buying groups builders or any other trade customers to which we sell a significant amount of products could adversely affect our financial performance additionally the loss of market share or financial difficulties including bankruptcy and financial restructuring by these trade customers could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity financial position and results of operationsrisks associated with our international operations may decrease our revenues and increase our costs for the year ended december 31 2015 we derived approximately 50 of our net sales from outside of north america including 16 in latin america 27 in emea and 7 in asia we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future accordingly we face numerous risks associated with conducting international operations any of which could negatively affect our financial performance these risks include the followingpolitical legal and economic instability and uncertaintyforeign currency exchange rate fluctuationschanges in foreign tax rules regulations and other requirements such as changes in tax rates and statutory and judicial interpretations of tax lawschanges in diplomatic and trade relationships including sanctions resulting from the current political situation in russia and ukraineinflationchanges in foreign country regulatory requirementsvarious importexport restrictions and the availability of required importexport licensesimposition of foreign tariffs and other trade barriersmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with us and foreign antibribery and anticorruption regulations such as the fcpa and antitrust lawswork stoppages and labor relationsdisruptions in the shipping of imported and exported productsgovernment price controlsextended payment terms and the inability to collect accounts receivable andlimitations on the repatriation or movement of earnings and cashas a us corporation we are subject to the fcpa which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations additionally any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other anticorruption laws could have a material adverse effect on usterrorist attacks armed conflicts labor disputes natural disasters governmental actions and epidemics could affect our domestic and international sales disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to produce and deliver our products such events could directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers both in the united states and elsewherefluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and purchased components could adversely affect our operating results the primary materials used to produce and manufacture our products are steel plastic resins and base metals such as aluminum copper zinc and nickel on a global and regional basis the sources and prices of those materials and components containing those materials are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supplydemand trends transportation costs government regulations and tariffs changes in currency exchange rates price controls the economic climate and other unforeseen circumstances significant increases in these and other costs in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 8foreign currency fluctuations may affect our financial performance we generate a significant portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar changes in the exchange rates of functional currencies of those operations affect the us dollar value of our revenue and earnings from our foreign operations we use currency forwards and options to manage our foreign currency transaction exposures we cannot completely eliminate our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations which may adversely affect our financial performance in addition because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant increase or decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings finally the amount of legal contingencies related to foreign operations may fluctuate significantly based upon changes in the exchange rates and usually cannot be managed with currency forwards options or other arrangements such fluctuations in exchange rates can significantly increase or decrease the amount of any legal contingency related to our foreign operations and make it difficult to assess and manage the potential exposure unfavorable results of legal and tax proceedings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition and performance we are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks relating to among other things products intellectual property rights income and nonincome taxes environmental matters corporate matters commercial matters competition laws and distribution marketing and trade practices for example we are currently disputing certain income and nonincome tax related assessments issued by the brazilian authorities relating to befiex cfc tax and to ipi tax credits see note 7 and note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters unfavorable outcomes regarding these assessments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and for some matters such as class actions no insurance is likely available regardless of merit legal proceedings may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations we estimate loss contingencies and establish accruals as required by generally accepted accounting principles based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable in light of the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time subsequent developments in legal proceedings volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and other factors may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded and could result in an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which a liability would be recognized or cash flows for the period in which amounts would be paid actual results may significantly vary from our reserveswe are subject to and could be further subject to governmental investigations or actions by other third parties we are subject to various federal foreign and state laws including antitrust laws violations of which can involve civil or criminal sanctions responding to governmental investigations or other actions may be both timeconsuming and disruptive to our operations and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations the impact of these and other investigations and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity and results of operationschanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities increase our operating costs reduce demand for our products or result in litigation the conduct of our businesses and the production distribution sale advertising safety transportation and use of many of our products are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal state and local governmental agencies in the united states as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets in which we operate these laws and regulations may change sometimes dramatically as a result of political economic or social events changes in laws regulations or governmental policy and the related interpretations may alter the environment in which we do business and therefore may impact our results or increase our costs or liabilities in addition we incur and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with various laws and regulations especially relating to protection of the environment human health and safety and energy efficiency these types of costs could adversely affect our financial performance additionally we could be subjected to future liabilities fines or penalties or the suspension of product production for failing to comply with various laws and regulations including environmental regulations cleanup obligations that might arise at any of our manufacturing sites or the imposition of more stringent environmental laws in the future could adversely affect usfailure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands depends on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if whether or not justified the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or product quality issues could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations9in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking and other websites that spread rapidly through such forums could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affectedan inability to effectively execute and manage our business objectives could adversely affect our financial performance the highly competitive nature of our industry requires that we effectively execute and manage our business including our global operating platform initiative our global operating platform initiative aims to reduce costs expand margins drive productivity and quality improvements accelerate our rate of innovation and drive shareholder value our inability to effectively control costs and drive productivity improvements could affect our profits in addition our inability to provide highquality innovative products could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our sales which could negatively affect our revenues and overall financial performance additionally our success is dependent on anticipating and appropriately reacting to changes in customer preferences and on successful new product and process development and product relaunches in response to such changes our future results and our ability to maintain or improve our competitive position will depend on our capacity to gauge the direction of our key markets and upon our ability to successfully and timely identify develop manufacture market and sell new or improved products in these changing markets we may be subject to information technology system failures network disruptions cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security which may materially adversely affect our operations financial condition and operating results we depend on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of our operations and to interface with our customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency information technology system failures including suppliers or vendors system failures could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors processing inefficiencies delays or cancellation of customer orders the loss of customers impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products other business disruptions or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breachin addition we have outsourced certain information technology support services and administrative functions such as payroll processing and benefit plan administration to thirdparty service providers and may outsource other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies if the service providers to which we outsource these functions do not perform effectively we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings and may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers depending on the function involved such errors may also lead to business disruption processing inefficiencies or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or harm employee moraleour information systems or those of our thirdparty service providers could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information corrupting information or disrupting business processes such unauthorized access could disrupt our business and could result in the loss of assets cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include but are not limited to malicious software attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data these events could impact our customers and reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions loss of business or potential liability or an increase in expense all of which may have a material adverse effect on our businessproduct liability or product recall costs could adversely affect our business and financial performance we are subject to the risk of exposure to product liability and product recall claims if any of our products are alleged to have resulted in injury to persons or damage to property in the event that any of our products prove to be defective we may need to recall andor redesign such products in addition any claim or product recall that results in significant adverse publicity particularly if those claims or recalls cause customers to question the safety or reliability of our products may negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations we do maintain product liability insurance but this insurance may not be adequate to cover losses related to product liability claims brought against us we may also be involved in certain class action and other litigation for which no insurance is available product liability insurance could become more expensive and difficult to maintain and may not be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all in addition we do not maintain any product recall insurance therefore any product recall we are required to initiate could have a significant impact on our operating results andor cash flowswe regularly engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to our customers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues and as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances currently we are implementing a corrective action plan affecting certain of our indesit and hotpoint branded dryers see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters actual costs of these issues and any future issues depend upon several factors including the number of consumers who respond to a particular recall repair and administrative costs whether the cost of any corrective action is borne initially by whirlpool or the supplier and if initially borne by whirlpool whether we will be successful in recovering our costs 10from the supplier the actual costs incurred as a result of these issues and any future issues could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationswe face inventory and other asset risk we writedown product and component inventories that have become obsolete or do not meet anticipated demand or net realizable value we also review our longlived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if we determine that impairment has occurred we record a writedown to adjust carrying value to fair value no assurance can be given that given the unpredictable pace of product obsolescence and business conditions with trade customers and in general we will not incur additional inventory or asset related charges such charges could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating resultswe are exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy uncertain and changing economic conditions within our regions along with national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions and government austerity measures are posing challenges to the industry in which whirlpool operates a number of economic factors including but not limited to gross domestic product availability of consumer credit interest rates consumer sentiment and debt levels retail trends housing starts sales of existing homes the level of mortgage refinancing and defaults fiscal and credit market uncertainty and foreign currency exchange rates generally affect demand for our products economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain customers to push out cancel or refrain from placing orders for our products uncertain market conditions difficulties in obtaining capital or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations exit markets merge with other retailers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations which can also result in lower sales andor additional inventory these conditions may similarly affect key suppliers which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for our products or

in economic activity and conditions in the united states latin america europe china and the other areas in which we operate have had an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in recent years and future declines and adverse conditions could have a similar adverse effect regional political and economic instability in russia and ukraine may adversely affect business conditions and may disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses sources and uses of cash financial condition and results of operations we may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts including restructuring activities which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery in addition our operations are subject to general credit liquidity foreign exchange market and interest rate risks our ability to invest in our businesses fund strategic acquisitions and refinance maturing debt obligations depends in part on access to the capital marketsif we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions or to difficulties in the financial markets or if we are unable to continue to access the capital markets our business financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected the ability of suppliers to deliver parts components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities and our ability to manufacture without disruption could affect our global business performance we use a wide range of materials and components in the global production of our products and use numerous suppliers to provide materials and components because we generally do not have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and some key parts may be available only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers we are subject to supply and pricing risk in addition certain proprietary component parts used in some of our products are provided by singlesource unaffiliated thirdparty suppliers we would be unable to obtain these proprietary component parts for an indeterminate period of time if these singlesource suppliers were to cease or interrupt production or otherwise fail to supply these components to us which could adversely affect our product sales and operating results our operations and operations at suppliers facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons including but not limited to work stoppages labor relations intellectual property claims against suppliers information technology failures and hazards such as fire earthquakes flooding or other natural disasters insurance for any of which may not be available affordable or adequate such disruption could interrupt our ability to manufacture certain products any significant disruption could negatively impact our revenue and earnings performance11our ability to attract develop and retain executives and other qualified employees is crucial to our results of operations and future growth we depend upon the continued services and performance of our key executives senior management and skilled personnel particularly our professionals with experience in our business and operations and the home appliance industry we cannot be sure that any of these individuals will continue to be employed by us a lengthy period of time is required to hire and develop replacement personnel when skilled personnel depart whirlpool an inability to hire develop engage and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees could materially hinder our business by for example delaying our ability to bring new products to market or impairing the success of our operationsa deterioration in labor relations could adversely impact our global business as of december 31 2015 we had approximately 97000 employees we are subject to separate collective bargaining agreements with certain labor unions which generally have two to three year terms as well as various other commitments regarding our workforce we are periodically in negotiations with certain of the unions representing our employees and may be subject to employee work stoppages that if such events were to occur may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations further we cannot be assured that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements on the same or similar terms or at all which may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operationsour intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products services and brands we consider our intellectual property rights including patents trademarks trade secrets and licensing agreements to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent trademark copyright and trade secret laws as well as licensing agreements and third party nondisclosure and assignment agreements our failure to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks products new features of our products or our processes may diminish our competitivenesswe have applied for patent protection in the united states and other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products product features and processes we cannot be assured that the us patent and trademark office or any other jurisdiction will approve any of our patent applications additionally the patents we own could be challenged invalidated or others could design around our patents and the patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage further the laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as united states law as a result these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products services and brands in foreign jurisdictions which could adversely affect our financial performancemoreover while we do not believe that any of our products infringe on enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties others may assert intellectual property rights that cover some of our technology brands products or services any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain productssignificant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and postretirement health care benefit programs and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes could adversely affect our financial results we have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees in north america europe asia and brazil we also have unfunded postretirement health care benefit plans for eligible retired employees the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the internal revenue code as amended govern the funding obligations for our us pension plans which are our principal pension plans our us defined benefit plans were frozen as of december 31 2006 for substantially all participants for 2007 and beyond whirlpool employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan as of december 31 2015 our projected benefit obligations under our pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit programs exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately 15 billion 10 billion of which was attributable to pension plans and 05 billion of which was attributable to postretirement health care benefits estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these pension plans and postretirement health and welfare benefit plans are based on various assumptions these assumptions include discount rates expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancies and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on changes in interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond market returns and health care cost trend rates all of which are largely outside our control significant differences in results or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our postretirement obligations and related future contributions and expenses

additional information about the acquisitions of hefei sanyo and indesit see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsinterest expenseinterest expense was unchanged compared to 2014 this was a result of higher average longterm debt balances offset by lower average interest rates on longterm debt during 2014 interest expense decreased 12 million compared to 2013 primarily due to lower interest ratesincome taxesincome tax expense was 209 million 189 million and 68 million in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the increase in tax expense in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to higher pretax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax ratethe increase in tax expense in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the absence of united states energy tax credits recognized in 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 signed in january 2013 reinstated the energy tax credit for 2012 and 2013 and resulted in a tax credit benefit related to the production of

reconciles projected 2016 cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap to free cash flow a nongaap measure management believes that free cash flow provides stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing whirlpools ability to fund its activities and obligations there are limitations to using nongaap financial measures including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similarly named nongaap measures whose calculations may differ from our calculations we define free cash flow as cash provided by continuing operations less capital expenditures and including proceeds from the sale of assetsbusinesses and changes in restricted cash the change in restricted cash relates to the private placement funds paid

permanent reinvestment with the balance available to be repatriated to the united states the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries operational activities and future foreign investments our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculationsources and uses of cashwe met our cash

customer were to default on its line of credit with the bank our subsidiary would be required to satisfy the obligation with the bank and the receivable would revert back to the subsidiary at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 the guaranteed amounts totaled 260 million and 492 million respectively our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through policies purchased from highquality underwriters we had no losses associated with these guarantees in 2015 or 2014 we have guaranteed a 43 million fiveyear revolving credit facility between certain financial institutions and a notforprofit entity in connection with a community and economic development project harbor shores the credit facility which originated in 2008 was amended in 2015 by harbor shores and reduced to 43 million was refinanced in december 2012 and we renewed our guarantee through 2017 the fair value of the guarantee is nominal the purpose of harbor shores is to stimulate employment and growth in the areas of benton harbor and st joseph michigan in the event of default we must satisfy the guarantee of the credit facility up to the amount borrowed at the date of defaultin the ordinary course of business we enter into agreements with financial institutions to issue bank guarantees letters of credit and surety bonds these agreements are primarily associated with unresolved tax matters in brazil as is customary under local regulations and governmental obligations related to certain employee benefit arrangements as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had approximately 290 million and 401 million outstanding under these agreements respectivelycritical accounting policies and estimatesthe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions we periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ materially from these estimates pension and other postretirement benefitsaccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the costs of future benefits and attributing the cost over the employees expected period of employment the determination of our obligation and expense for these costs requires the use of certain assumptions those assumptions include the discount rate expected longterm rate of return on plan assets life expectancy and health care cost trend rates these assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds stock and bond markets and medical cost inflation respectively actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore generally affect our recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and actual experience significant differences in results or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and related future expense26managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of

which we operate this involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items such as the timing for recognizing expenses for tax and accounting purposes these differences may result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheets we are required to assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets which include net operating loss carryforwards foreign tax credits and deductible temporary differences that are expected to be realizable in future years realization of our net operating loss and foreign tax credit deferred tax assets is supported by specific tax planning strategies and where possible considers projections of future profitability if recovery is not more likely than not we provide a valuation allowance based on estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable if future taxable income is lower than expected or if tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated we may record additional valuation allowances through income tax expense in the period such determination is made likewise if we determine that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of net recorded amounts an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will benefit income tax expense in the period such determination is madeas of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had total deferred tax assets of 33 billion and 32 billion respectively net of valuation allowances of 286 million and 308 million respectively our income tax benefit or expense has fluctuated considerably over the last five years from a tax benefit of 436 million in 2011 to the current year tax expense of 209 million and has been influenced primarily by us energy tax credits audit settlements and adjustments tax planning strategies enacted legislation and dispersion of global income future changes in the effective tax rate will be subject to several factors including remaining befiex credits business profitability tax planning strategies and enacted tax laws in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve for additional information about income taxes see notes 1 7 and 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsbefiex creditsin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales as

statementslegacy product corrective action reservesin the normal course of business we engage in investigations of potential quality and safety issues as part of our ongoing effort to deliver quality products to consumers we are currently investigating a limited number of potential quality and safety issues globally as necessary we undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted 27managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedas part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit these dryer production platforms were developed by indesit prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas and indesit brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit produced in september 2015 we recorded a liability related to the corrective action we estimate the most probable pretax and after tax cost of the corrective action to be 245 million and 196 million respectively approximately 274 million and 219 million respectively as of september 30 2015 based on certain tax deductibility assumptionsapproximately 90 of the affected units were manufactured by indesit prior to its acquisition by the company in october 2014 accordingly we increased the warranty liability as a purchase accounting adjustment in the opening balance sheet with a corresponding increase to goodwill of 210 million approximately 235 million as of september 30 2015 during 2015 we recognized expenses of 39 million related to legacy product corrective action on the heritage indesit product in europe the establishment of this liability is based on several assumptions such as customer response rate consumer options field repair costs inventory repair costs and timing of tax deductibility our experience with respect to these factors may cause our actual costs to differ significantly from our estimated costs in addition we intend to seek indemnity under the terms of the indesit acquisition agreements any amounts we recover from the seller would reduce our net costswe expect the corrective action affecting these dryers to have future cash expenditures in 2016 of approximately 155 million with the remaining cash expenditures occurring in 2017  for additional information about the indesit corrective action see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementswarranty obligationsthe estimation of warranty obligations is determined in the same period that revenue from the sale of the related products is recognized the warranty obligation is based on historical experience and represents our best estimate of expected costs at the time products are sold warranty accruals are adjusted for known or anticipated warranty claims as new information becomes available new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available future events and circumstances could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to the warranty obligations for additional information about warranty obligations see note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statementsgoodwill and intangiblescertain business acquisitions have resulted in the recording of goodwill and trademark assets upon acquisition the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities including trademark assets based on estimated fair value with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill most trademarks and goodwill are considered indefinitelife intangible assets and as such are not amortized at december 31 2015 we had goodwill of approximately 30 billion there have been no changes to our reporting units or allocations of goodwill by reporting units except for goodwill resulting from the acquisitions and changes in purchase price allocations or the impact of foreign currency we have trademark assets in our north america emea and asia operating segments with a total carrying value of approximately 27 billion as of december 31 2015 we perform our annual impairment assessment for goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets as of october 1st and more frequently if indicators of impairment exist in 2015 the company elected to perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques to evaluate goodwill and other indefinitelife intangible assets many of the factors used in assessing fair values are outside the control of management and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods these changes can result in future impairmentsgoodwill valuationsin performing a quantitative assessment we estimate fair value using the best information available to us including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach the income approach uses operating 28managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedsegments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions the projection uses managements best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales costs and number of units estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures other estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements the estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying valuessensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting units operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactionsif actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the companys financial statementsbased on the results of our quantitative assessment conducted on october 1 2015 the fair values of whirlpools operating segments continue to exceed their respective carrying values  the range by which the excess fair value of our operating segments goodwill exceeded their respective carrying values was 12 to 108intangible valuationswhen performing a quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using the relieffromroyalty method which requires assumptions related to projected revenues from our annual longrange plan assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the trademark and a discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital if the estimated fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value we would recognize an impairment losstwo trademarks acquired in fourth quarter of 2014 have fair values that exceed their carrying values by less than 10 the fair values of all other trademarks exceeded their carrying

we expect revenue trends for this brand to improve as we continue to execute specific brand investments and product development plans our assessment indicates no impairment as of december 31 2015we performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair value noting that a 10 reduction of forecasted revenues a 50 basis point reduction in royalty rate or a 50 basis point increase in discount rate would result in an impairment of approximately 51 million 80 million or 22 million respectivelyif actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions indefinitelife intangible assets may be overstated and a charge against net income would be required which would adversely affect the companys financial statementsbased on the results of our quantitative assessment performed as of october 1 2014 impairment of two trademarks was determined to exist primarily driven by a change in our brand strategy in emea as a result of the acquisition of indesit and resulted in a charge

material effect on our consolidated financial statementsother mattersembraco antitrust mattersbeginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the united states embraco has also resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending additional lawsuits could be filed  at december 31 2015 10 million remains accrued with installment payments of 8 million plus interest due at various times through 2016 we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting period30managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedbefiex credits and other brazil tax mattersin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales as the credits were monetized we did not monetize any befiex credits during the year ended december 31 2015 we monetized 14 million and 109 million of befiex credits during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we recognized export credits as they were monetizedin december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2015 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period has been subject to review by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits we are awaiting the resolution of additional proceedings on the retroactive effect of the reinstituted index our brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 15 billion brazilian reais approximately 395 million as of december 31 2015relying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 219 million brazilian reais approximately 56 million as of december 31 2015 reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these mattersin 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled on one of our cases finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2015 our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 161 million brazilian reais approximately 41 million as of december 31 2015 we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million brazilian reais to be paid in 30 monthly installments which began in december 2013 there was a nominal amount of outstanding principal interest and penalties at december 31 2015 the payments for which we will complete during 201631managements discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations  continuedin addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings sessions of trial of the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals or carf have resumed after having been suspended for several months while changes in carf procedures and staffing were implemented the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positionslitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodother litigationwe have vigorously defended against numerous lawsuits pending in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines we have reached preliminary agreement on a settlement that will resolve all such class action lawsuits the settlement has been accounted for in interest and sundry income expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 the settlement requires court approval in order to be finalized and we are proceeding through the court process to request such approval in addition we are currently vigorously defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations and may become involved in similar actions in other jurisdictions these lawsuits allege claims which include negligence breach of contract breach of warranty product liability and safety claims fraud and violation of federal and state regulations including consumer protection acts we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our financial position liquidity or results of operations other mattersin 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation of appliance manufacturers and retailers in france the investigation includes 11 manufacturers including the whirlpool and indesit operations in france although it is currently not possible to assess the impact if any this matter may have on our consolidated financial statements the resolution of this matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodantidumping petitionon december 16 2015 we submitted a petition requesting that the us department of commerce and the united states international trade commission initiate antidumping investigations regarding large residential washers from china sold by samsung and lg into the united states the purpose of this petition similar to the petitions we filed in december 2011 regarding large residential washers from south korea and mexico is to establish conditions of fair competition in the united states that will support significant investment and innovation in the production of large residential washers in the united states and the us jobs created by that production this petition is the result of our continual monitoring of the large residential washer landscape which highlighted that samsung and lg have continued to dump washers into the united states following the conclusion of our earlier case in 2013 the whirlpool washers affected by the imports subject in this case are made in clyde ohiothere are several steps in the process of the antidumping investigation we expect a preliminary determination of the amount of dumping in july 2016 the preliminary determination will be followed by several other steps leading to a final decision from the us department of commerce and the us

to these risks through our operating and financing activities and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivatives derivatives are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for

foreign currency forward contracts currency options and currency swaps to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted crossborder payments and receipts related to ongoing business and operational financing activities foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015 a 10 favorable or unfavorable exchange rate movement in each currency in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized gain of approximately 65 million or loss of approximately 80 million consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses respectively in the remeasurement of the underlying exposureswe enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted commodities purchases the prices of which are not fixed directly through supply contracts as of december 31 2015 a 10 favorable or unfavorable shift in commodity prices would have resulted in an incremental gain or loss of approximately 35

consolidate the financial statements of any company in which we have an ownership interest of 50 or less unless that company is deemed to be a variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary

those estimatesrevenue recognitionsales are recorded when title passes to the customer as determined by the shipping terms for the majority of our sales title is transferred to the customer as soon as products are shipped for a portion of our sales title is transferred to the customer upon receipt of products at the customers location allowances for estimated returns are made on sales of certain products based on historical return rates for the products involvedaccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accountswe carry accounts receivable at sales value less an allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate accounts receivable and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specific customer circumstances credit conditions and the history of

on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we had no level 3 assets or

company performs a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow model and other valuation techniques but may elect to perform a qualitative analysisin performing a quantitative assessment we estimate fair value using the best information available to us including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach the income approach uses operating segments projection of estimated operating results and cash flows that are discounted using a weightedaverage cost of capital that is determined based on current market conditions the projection uses managements best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales costs and number of units estimates of future expected changes

expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements the estimated fair value of each operating segment is compared to their respective carrying valuessensitivity analyses were performed around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values additionally we validate our estimates of fair value under the income approach by comparing the values to fair value estimates using a market approach a market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting units operating performance the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics of the reporting units we consider the implied control premium and conclude whether the implied control premium is reasonable based on other recent market transactionsif the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the company then performs additional analysis to determine if the reporting units goodwill should be impaired if actual results are not consistent with managements estimate and assumptions goodwill may be overstated and a

notes passed a resolution which amended the terms and conditions of the notes so that they are better aligned to the terms and conditions of notes and bonds issued by whirlpool corporation as a result of the passage of the resolution whirlpool has agreed to be a guarantor of the notes these notes contain covenants that limit our ability to incur certain liens or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions in addition if we experience a specific kind of change of control we are required to make an offer to purchase all of the notes at a purchase price of 101 of the principal

payable at december 31 2015 indesit acquired by whirlpool in the fourth quarter of 2014 had maintained a securitization program since 2010 the securitization involved the withoutrecourse sale of trade receivables by indesit the receivables were acquired by vies which were financed by the issuance of securities whose repayment was guaranteed by the cash flows generated by the receivables sold whirlpool stopped the sale of receivables related to the securitization beginning in december 2014 and this debt securitization was exited as planned through the first quarter of 2015 there are no outstanding balances as of december 31 2015 related to the securitization program7 commitments and contingencies other mattersembraco antitrust mattersbeginning in february 2009 our compressor business headquartered in brazil embraco was notified of antitrust investigations of the global compressor industry by government authorities in various jurisdictions embraco has resolved government investigations in various jurisdictions as well as all related civil lawsuits in the united states embraco has also resolved certain other claims and certain claims remain pending additional lawsuits could be filed  at december 31 2015 10 million remains accrued with installment payments of 8 million plus interest due at various times through 2016 we continue to defend these actions and take other steps to minimize our potential exposure the final outcome and impact of these matters and any related claims and investigations that may be brought in the future are subject to many variables and cannot be predicted we establish accruals only for those matters where we determine that a loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated while it is currently not possible to reasonably estimate the aggregate amount of costs which we may incur in connection with these matters such costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodbefiex credits and other brazil tax mattersin previous years our brazilian operations earned tax credits under the brazilian governments export incentive program befiex these credits reduced brazilian federal excise taxes on domestic sales resulting in an increase in the operations recorded net sales as the credits were monetized we did not monetize any befiex credits during the year ended december 31 2015 we monetized 14 million and 109 million of befiex credits during the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 we began recognizing befiex credits in accordance with prior favorable court decisions allowing for the credits to be recognized we recognized export credits as they were monetized in december 2013 the brazilian government reinstituted the monetary adjustment index applicable to befiex credits that existed prior to july 2009 when the brazilian government required companies to apply a different monetary adjustment index to befiex credits as of december 31 2015 no befiex credits deemed to be available prior to this action remained to be monetized whether use of the reinstituted index should be given retroactive effect for the july 2009 to december 2013 period has been subject to review by the brazilian courts if the reinstituted index is given retroactive effect we would be entitled to recognize additional credits we are awaiting the resolution of additional proceedings on the retroactive effect of the reinstituted indexour brazilian operations have received governmental assessments related to claims for income and social contribution taxes associated with befiex credits monetized from 2000 through 2002 and 2007 through 2011 we do not believe befiex export credits are subject to income or social contribution taxes we are disputing these tax matters in various courts and intend to vigorously defend our positions we have not provided for income or social contribution taxes on these export credits and based on the opinions of tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015 the total amount of outstanding tax assessments received for income and social contribution taxes relating to the befiex credits including interest and penalties is approximately 15 billion brazilian reais approximately 395 million as of december 31 201551notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedrelying on existing brazilian legal precedent in 2003 and 2004 we recognized tax credits in an aggregate amount of 26 million adjusted for currency on the purchase of raw materials used in production ipi tax credits the brazilian tax authority subsequently challenged the recording of ipi tax credits no credits have been recognized since 2004 in 2009 we entered into a brazilian government program which provided extended payment terms and reduced penalties and interest to encourage tax payers to resolve this and certain other disputed tax credit amounts as permitted by the program we elected to settle certain debts through the use of other existing tax credits and recorded charges of approximately 34 million in 2009 associated with these matters in july 2012 the brazilian revenue authority notified us that a portion of our proposed settlement was rejected and we received tax assessments of 219 million brazilian reais approximately 56 million as of december 31 2015 reflecting interest and penalties to date we are disputing these assessments and we intend to vigorously defend our position based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not recorded an additional reserve related to these mattersin 2001 brazil adopted a law making the profits of controlled foreign corporations of brazilian entities subject to income and social contribution tax regardless of whether the profits were repatriated cfc tax our brazilian subsidiary along with other corporations challenged tax assessments on foreign profits on constitutionality and other grounds in april 2013 the brazilian supreme court ruled on one of our cases finding that the law is constitutional but remanding the case to a lower court for consideration of other arguments raised in our appeal including the existence of tax treaties with jurisdictions in which controlled foreign corporations are domiciled as of december 31 2015 our potential exposure for income and social contribution taxes relating to profits of controlled foreign corporations including interest and penalties and net of expected foreign tax credits is approximately 161 million brazilian reais approximately 41 million as of december 31 2015 we believe these assessments are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously dispute them based on the opinion of our tax and legal advisors we have not accrued any amount related to these assessments as of december 31 2015in december 2013 we entered into a brazilian government program to settle long standing disputes participation in the program removed uncertainty related to 16 assessments that were previously under dispute and significantly reduces potential penalties and interest associated with these matters our participation will result in total payments including principal interest and penalties of 75 million brazilian reais to be paid in 30 monthly installments which began in december 2013 the outstanding balance of principal interest and penalties at december 31 2015 is 24 million brazilian reais approximately 6 million as of december 31 2015in addition to the ipi tax credit and cfc tax matters noted above we are currently disputing other assessments issued by the brazilian tax authorities related to nonincome and income tax matters including for the monetization of befiex credits and other matters which are at various stages of review in numerous administrative and judicial proceedings sessions of trial of the brazilian administrative council of tax appeals or carf have resumed after having been suspended for several months while changes in carf procedures and staffing were being implemented the amounts related to these assessments will continue to be increased by monetary adjustments at the selic rate which is the benchmark rate set by the brazilian central bank in accordance with our accounting policies we routinely assess these matters and when necessary record our best estimate of a loss we believe these tax assessments are without merit and are vigorously defending our positionslitigation is inherently unpredictable and the conclusion of these matters may take many years to ultimately resolve accordingly it is possible that an unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position liquidity or results of operations in any particular reporting periodother litigationwe have vigorously defended against numerous lawsuits pending in the united states relating to certain of our front load washing machines we have reached preliminary agreement on a settlement that will resolve all such class action lawsuits the settlement has been accounted for in interest and sundry income expense in the fourth quarter of 2015 the settlement requires court approval in order to be finalized and we are proceeding through the court process to request such approvalin addition we are currently vigorously defending a number of other lawsuits in federal and state courts in the united states related to the manufacturing and sale of our products which include class action allegations and may become involved in similar actions in other jurisdictions these lawsuits allege claims which include negligence breach of contract breach of warranty product liability and safety claims fraud and violation of federal and state regulations including consumer protection acts we do not have insurance coverage for class action lawsuits we are also involved in various other legal actions in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world arising in the normal course of business for which insurance coverage may or may not be available depending on the nature of the action we dispute the merits of these suits and actions and intend to vigorously defend them management believes based upon its current knowledge after taking into consideration legal counsels evaluation of such suits and actions and after taking into account current litigation accruals that the outcome of these matters currently pending against whirlpool should not have a material adverse effect if any on our financial position liquidity or results of operations52notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedother mattersin 2013 the french competition authority commenced an investigation

undertake to effect repair or replacement of appliances in the event that an investigation leads to the conclusion that such action is warranted as part of that process in 2015 whirlpool engaged in thorough investigations of incident reports associated with two of its dryer production platforms developed by indesit prior to whirlpools acquisition of indesit in october 2014 this led to indesit reporting the issue to regulatory authorities for consideration these discussions determined that corrective action of the affected dryers was required whirlpool has implemented modifications at the point of manufacture to ensure that dryers produced after october 2015 are not affected by this issue an outreach and service campaign is underway to modify dryers that have already been sold such dryers were manufactured between april 2004 and october 2015 and sold in the uk and other countries in the emea region under the hotpoint whirlpool ownership of the hotpoint brand in emea and asia pacific regions is not affiliated with the hotpoint brand sold in the americas and indesit brand names as well as various other brands owned by other manufacturers distributors and retailers whose products indesit produced in september 2015 we recorded a liability related to this corrective action we estimate the most probable cost of the corrective action is 245 million approximately 274 million as of september 30 2015 approximately 90 of the affected units were manufactured by indesit prior to its acquisition by the company in october 2014 accordingly we increased the warranty

december 31 2014 the guaranteed amounts totaled 260 million and 492 million respectively our subsidiary insures against credit risk for these guarantees under normal operating conditions through

are accounted for at fair value based on market rates derivatives where we elect hedge accounting are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges derivatives that are not accounted for based on hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use and designation of the derivative instrument hedging ineffectiveness and a net earnings impact occur when the change in the fair value of the hedge does not offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in earningsusing derivative instruments means assuming counterparty credit risk counterparty credit risk relates to the loss we could incur if a counterparty were to default on a derivative contract we generally deal with investment grade counterparties and monitor the overall credit risk and exposure to individual counterparties we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparties the amount of counterparty credit exposure is limited to the unrealized gains if any on such derivative contracts we do not require nor do we post collateral or security on such contracts54notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedhedging strategyin the normal course of business we manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations including those arising from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices fluctuations in these rates and prices can affect our operating results and financial condition we use a variety of strategies including the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposesforeign currency exchange rate riskwe incur expenses associated with the procurement and production of products in a limited number of countries while we sell in the local currencies of a large number of countries our primary foreign currency exchange exposures result from crosscurrency sales of products as a result we enter into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments and forecasted transactions to acquire products and services that are denominated in foreign currencieswe enter into certain undesignated nonfunctional currency asset and liability hedges that relate primarily to shortterm payables receivables and intercompany loans these forecasted crosscurrency cash flows relate primarily to foreign currency denominated expenditures and intercompany financing agreements royalty agreements and dividends when we hedge a foreign currency denominated payable or receivable with a derivative the effect of changes in the foreign exchange rates are reflected currently in interest and sundry income expense for both the payablereceivable and the derivative therefore as a result of the economic hedge we do not elect hedge accountingcommodity price riskwe enter into commodity derivative contracts on various commodities to manage the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process the objective of these hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with the forecasted purchase of commoditiesinterest rate riskwe may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure our interest rate swap agreements if any effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through converting certain of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis and certain fixed rate debt to a floating rate basis these agreements involve either the receipt or payment of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments or receipts respectively over the life of the agreements without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts we also may utilize a crosscurrency interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure relating to certain intercompany debt denominated in one foreign currency that will be repaid in another foreign currency at december 31 2015 and 2014 there were no outstanding swap agreementswe may enter into treasury rate lock agreements to effectively modify our exposure to interest rate risk by lockingin interest rates on probable longterm debt issuances55notes to the consolidated financial statements  continuedthe following tables summarize our outstanding

to the consolidated financial statements  continuedunited states tax on foreign dividendswe have historically reinvested all unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates we plan to distribute approximately 11 million of foreign earnings over the next several years this distribution is forecasted to result in tax benefits which have not been recorded because of their contingent nature there has been no deferred tax liability provided on the remaining amount of unremitted earnings of 42 billion at december 31 2015 the company had cash and cash equivalents of 772 million at december 31 2015 of which 726 million was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the united states and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds to fund our us operations however if these funds were repatriated then we would be required to accrue and pay applicable united states taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various countries the repatriation could result in an adjustment to the tax liability after considering available foreign tax credits and other tax attributes it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability associated with these unremitted earnings due to the complexity of its hypothetical calculationvaluation allowancesat december 31 2015 we had net operating loss carryforwards of 34 billion 11 billion of which were united states state net operating loss carryforwards of the total net

which 106 million of benefit has been recognized in net earnings since 2011 with an offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax in response a group of retirees initiated legal proceedings against whirlpool asserting the above benefits are vested we disagree with plaintiffs assertion and intend to continue vigorously defending our position including through any necessary

of return on plan assets was determined by using the historical asset returns for publicly traded equity and fixed income securities tracked since 1926 and the historical returns for private equity the historical equity returns were adjusted downward to reflect future expectations the expected returns are weighted by the targeted asset allocations the resulting weightedaverage return was rounded to the nearest quarter of one percentfor foreign pension plans the expected rate of return on plan assets was primarily determined by observing historical returns in the local fixed income and equity

orderly transaction between market participants as such fair value is a marketbased measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset as a basis for considering such assumptions a threetiered fair value hierarchy is established which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level 1 observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level 2 inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly and level 3 unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions we manage the process and approve the results of a third party pricing service to value the majority of our securities and
