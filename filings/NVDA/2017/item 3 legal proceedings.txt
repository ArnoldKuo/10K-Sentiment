purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability our industry is characterized by relatively short lead time orders and delivery schedules thus we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significantseasonalityour gpu and tegra processor platforms serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue stems from the consumer industry our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue9table of contentsmanufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations while we may directly procure certain raw materials used in the production of our products such as substrates and a variety of components our suppliers are responsible for procurement of the majority of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer supportwe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products and platforms we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporation and memory from samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynixwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutionswe also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd auto co ltd and quanta computer to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process working capitalwe focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demandsour existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 35 to 680 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017 compared with the end of fiscal year 2016 we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months10table of contentsresearch and development we believe that the

component of our product development effort is our partnerships with industry leaders we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of visual computing and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated productsas of january 29 2017 we had 7282 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 we incurred research and development expenses of 146 billion 133 billion and 136 billion respectively competition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change and evolving industry standards we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and partners and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers and partners will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market sharea significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus embedded socs and accelerated and ai computing processor products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of

design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships and our financial results14table of contentssystem security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputationsecurity breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systemsactual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputationif our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial resultsif we do not replace our intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected in january 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years the final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in january 2016 we will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 if we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected15table of contentswe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results includinga lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraintsa failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our productsa failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm finfet and memory designs such as cowos needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basisloss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a suppliera lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality anddelays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwisewe also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could declineif we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmedfor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design wins we mustanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers andprice our products competitivelyunanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 16table of contentsbusiness disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costsour worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmedwe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network with several of these partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels as a result revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 12 11 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausemost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour partners may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionwe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficientour gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginour gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted17table of contentsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmedwe manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not

significant decrease in demand for our productsa higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirementsour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products orincreased competition including competitive pricing actionsin addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damagedwe

products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultswe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections19table of contentsour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could declineour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear programs for the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should
