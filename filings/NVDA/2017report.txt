unimicron technology corporation and memory from samsung semiconductor inc and sk hynixwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and aib solutionswe also utilize industryleading contract manufacturers or cms such as byd auto co ltd and quanta computer to manufacture some of our products for sale directly to end customers in those cases key elements such as the gpu soc and memory are often consigned by us to the cms who are responsible for the procurement of other components used in the production process working capitalwe focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and partners and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a platformbyplatform basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demandsour existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 35 to 680 billion at the end of fiscal year 2017 compared with the end of fiscal year 2016

common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risks including but not limited to the risks described below any one of the following risks could harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks trends and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our businessrisks related to our business industry and partnersif we fail to meet the evolving needs of our markets identify new products services or technologies or successfully compete in our target markets our revenue and financial results will be adversely impactednvidiabranded solutions and services are visual computing and accelerated computing platforms that address four large markets gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to meet the evolving needs of these markets and to enhance our existing products services and technologies in addition our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry trends and to develop new products services and technologies our existing markets and products and new markets and products may require a considerable investment of technical financial compliance sales and marketing resources we are currently devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and business offerings in markets where our operating history is less extensive such as the automotive marketwe cannot assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative products and technologies that provide value to our customers and partners if we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our target markets and emerging technology trends or adapt that strategy as market conditions evolve in a timely manner to exploit potential market opportunities our business will be harmed in addition if demand for products and services from these growth markets is below our expectations if we fail to achieve consumer or market acceptance of them or if we are not able to develop these products and services in a cost effective or efficient manner we may not realize benefits from our strategy our target markets remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product andor service offerings industry standards continue to evolve and new competitors enter these markets if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets including in significant international markets such as china demand for our products services and technologies could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer our competitors products services and technologies may be less costly or may offer superior functionality or different features than ours in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater financial sales marketing and distribution resources than we do these competitors may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new markets and end user customer trends quickly transition their semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials which could harm our business if we are unable to successfully compete in our target markets or introduce new offerings in light of the competitive environment our results of operations could sufferif our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impactedmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers and partners lower than expected yields could harm customer or partner relationships and our financial results14table of contentssystem security and data protection breaches as well as cyberattacks could disrupt our operations reduce our expected revenue and increase our expenses which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputationsecurity breaches computer malware and cyberattacks have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent years these attacks have occurred on our systems in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmers hackers and employees may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employees or third parties these attacks may create system disruptions or cause shutdowns these hackers may also develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerabilities in our products including consumer and automotive products where we utilize overtheair updates to improve functionality over time for portions of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software products we rely on products and services provided by third parties these providers may also experience breaches and attacks to their products which may impact our systems data security breaches may also result from nontechnical means such as actions by an employee with access to our systemsactual or perceived breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us our partners our customers or third parties could expose the parties affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our efforts to prevent and overcome these challenges could increase our expenses and may not be successful we may experience interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other critical functions delayed sales lower margins or lost customers as a result of these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputationif our products contain significant defects we could incur significant expenses to remediate such defects our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system our products are used by a variety of industries including the automotive industry failure of our products to perform to specifications or other product defects could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell directly to customers the end product in which our device has been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier 1 automotive suppliers and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause us to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement costs cause us to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins and harm our relationships with customers and partners and consumers perceptions of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customers partners or consumers including costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall particularly an automotive recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation result in the shifting of business to our competitors and result in litigation against us such as product liability suits if a product liability claim is brought against us the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms which could adversely impact our financial resultsif we do not replace our intel licensing revenues our financial results may be adversely affected in january 2011 we entered into a patent cross licensing agreement under which intel agreed to pay us an aggregate of 150 billion over six years the final 200 million payment under this agreement was received in january 2016 we will be recognizing revenue under this agreement through the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 if we do not enter into new licensing agreements or if the intel agreement is not offset by other growth in income our financial results may be adversely affected15table of contentswe depend on third parties and their technology to manufacture assemble test andor package our products which reduces our control over product quantity and quality development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our gpus and tegra processors and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques similarly we do not assemble test or package our products but instead rely on independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd we do not have longterm commitment contracts with these foundries or subcontractors as a result we face several significant risks which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand andor negatively impact our business operations gross margin revenue andor financial results includinga lack of guaranteed supply of wafers and other components and potential higher wafer and component prices due to supply constraintsa failure by our foundries to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our productsa failure to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies such as 16nm finfet and memory designs such as cowos needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basisloss of a supplier and additional expense andor production delays as a result of qualifying a new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a suppliera lack of direct control over delivery schedules or product quantity and quality anddelays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwisewe also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements and to bring such new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could declineif we fail to achieve design wins for our products our business will be harmedfor our products that we do not sell directly to consumers achieving design wins is an important success factor our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows if oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration in order to achieve design wins we mustanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers andprice our products competitivelyunanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers further if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards our customers may not incorporate our products into their design strategies 16table of contentsbusiness disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costsour worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages outages at cloud service providers tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmedwe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers within our partner network with several of these partners we are selling multiple target market platforms through their channels as a result revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 12 11 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales within our partner network as well as the ability of these partners to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these partners may decide to purchase fewer products than they did in the past not to incorporate our products into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausemost of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour partners may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionwe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficientour gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginour gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products and services process node transitions product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted17table of contentsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmedwe manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit marketa sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsa higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirementsour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products less demand than expected for newlyintroduced products orincreased competition including competitive pricing actionsin addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damagedwe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our businesswe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 80 79 and 75 of total revenue for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties includinginternational economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do businessunexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practiceslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from

climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limitsif sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted18table of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or

other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive reliefwe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third partys patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third partys patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultswe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protections19table of contentsour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could declineour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear programs for the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performancefactors that could affect our results of operations in the future includedemand and market

analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition inventories income taxes goodwill cash equivalents and marketable securities stockbased compensation and litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilitieswe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10krevenue recognitionproduct revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapseour customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such cases the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their cemsodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue30table of contentsour customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns license and development revenuefor license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total cost any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any periodfor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue please refer to note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional informationinventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditionssituations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 02 16 and 06 in fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions during these fiscal years were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our productsplease refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion31table of contentsincome taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedunited states income tax has not been provided for a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedour calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of january 29 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodgoodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified two reporting units gpu and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to the gpu and tegra processor reporting units as of january 29 2017 was 210 million and 408 million respectively determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertainduring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we elected to use the quantitative assessment to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit in applying the fair value based test of each reporting unit the results from the income approach and the market approach were equally weighted these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our businesswhen performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting units32table of contentsduring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill the fair values of our gpu and tegra processor reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values as such even the application of a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit would not have resulted in the fair value of either reporting unit being less than its carrying value as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of our reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting unitscash equivalents and marketable securitiescash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months when purchased we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 29 2017 we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no otherthantemporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of availableforsale investments as of january 29 2017please refer to notes 6 and 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional informationstockbased

recognition of excess tax benefits from our adoption of a new accounting standard related to the simplification of certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting the higher effective tax rate in fiscal year 2016 as compared to fiscal years 2017 and 2015 was due to an additional amount of earnings subject to united states tax in fiscal year 2016 partially offset by a net income tax benefit

shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of 33 million investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may be negatively impacted due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in

realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates cash cash equivalent and marketable

interest rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates in order to mitigate the interest rate risk on the operating lease financing arrangement in fiscal year 2016 we entered into

relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and then reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occurduring fiscal year 2017 we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements

last sunday in january fiscal years 2017 and 2015 were 52week years and fiscal year 2016 was a 53week yearreclassificationscertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentationprinciples of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nvidia corporation and our whollyowned subsidiaries all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidationuse of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation litigation investigation and settlement costs restructuring and other charges and other contingencies these estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonablerevenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment 54table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedfor sales to certain distributors with rights of return for which the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our policy is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product and in some cases when customer return rights lapse our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with original equipment manufacturers or oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems in such cases the oems may not be our direct customers and therefore the quantity and mix of demand they place on their contract equipment manufacturers or cems and original device manufacturers or odms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents less than 05 of total revenue our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders oems distributors addin card partners and other channel partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns license and development revenuefor license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete the project a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenuefor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee55table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedrestructuring and other charges our restructuring and other charges include employee severance and related costs the writedown of assets and other exit costs the severance and related costs include onetime termination benefits as well as certain statutory termination benefits or employee terminations under ongoing benefit arrangements onetime termination benefits are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the approved plan of termination has been communicated to employees unless employees must provide future service in which case the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period ongoing termination benefits arrangements are recognized as a liability at estimated fair value when the amount of such benefits becomes estimable and payment is probable any contract termination costs are recognized at estimated fair value when we terminate the contract in accordance with the contract terms other associated costs are recognized in the period the liability is incurredadvertising expenseswe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred advertising expenses for fiscal years 2017 2016 and 2015 were 17 million 30 million and 21 million respectively rent expense we recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid product warranties we generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedstockbased compensation we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus and performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets or psus we use a monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock units that are based on market conditions or marketbased psus the compensation expense for stock options rsus and marketbased psus is recognized using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the blackscholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stockbased compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeitures annually based on historical experience and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates if factors change the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current periodlitigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs 56table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedforeign currency remeasurement we use the united states dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into united states dollars at endofperiod exchange rates nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income and to date have not been significantthe impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income expense net was a 5 million loss for fiscal year 2017 and was not significant for fiscal years 2016 and 2015income taxes we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedunited states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedour calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of january 29 2017 we had a valuation allowance of 353 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodwe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 13 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional informationcomprehensive income  comprehensive income

their effect is antidilutive additionally we issued convertible notes with a net settlement feature that requires us upon conversion to settle the principal amount of debt for cash and the conversion premium for cash or shares of our common stock our convertible notes note hedges and related warrants contain various conversion features which are further described in note 11 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements the potentially dilutive shares resulting from the convertible notes and warrants under the treasury stock method will be included in the calculation of diluted

either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges the gains losses are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses gains on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged for derivative instruments designated as cashflow hedges the effective portion of the gains losses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable note hedge and interest rate swap our investment policy requires the purchase of high grade investment securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration all marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 29 of our accounts receivable balance from two customers as of january 29 2017 and 28 of our account receivable balance from two customers as of january 31 2016 we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of creditaccounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we determine this allowance by identifying amounts for specific customer issues as well as amounts based on overall estimated exposure factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of creditinventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and a gain or loss is recorded the estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset59table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedgoodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist for the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis for those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighting the results from the income approach and the market approach the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities please refer to note 4 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information intangible assets and other longlived assets intangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from three to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated60table

pronouncementin fiscal year 2017 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an accounting standards update which simplifies certain aspects of stockbased compensation accounting among other elements the new guidance eliminates additional paid in capital or apic pools and requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled in addition cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows we elected to early adopt this new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 which required us to reflect any adjustments as of february 1 2016 early adoption of this guidance resulted in the followingwe recorded an excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation within income tax expense rather than in apic of 82 million for fiscal year 2017we recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of february 1 2016 to increase retained earnings by 353 million with a corresponding increase to deferred tax assets to recognize the federal net operating loss and federal research tax credit carryforwards attributable to excess tax benefits on stockbased compensation that had not been previously recognized in apic we also recorded deferred tax assets of 63 million with a corresponding full valuation allowance related to state net operating loss and state research credit carryforwardsthe excess tax benefit from stockbased compensation is now included in net operating cash rather than net financing cash in our consolidated statements of cash flows we elected to apply this change in presentation prospectively and thus prior periods have not been adjustedwe elected not to change our policy on accounting for forfeitures although the new guidance provides an option for us to account for forfeitures as they occur and thus continued to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in january 2017 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment the update eliminates the second step in the goodwill impairment test that requires an entity to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill instead an entity should recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit with the impairment loss not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit the update will be effective for us beginning in our fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsin october 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that requires the recognition of income tax consequences for intraentity transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs the update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in august 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that clarifies how companies present and classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows the update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statementsin june 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that changes the accounting for recognizing impairments of financial assets under the new guidance credit losses for certain types of financial instruments will be estimated based on expected losses the update also modifies the impairment models for availableforsale debt securities and for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination the update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2021 with early adoption permitted the adoption of this accounting guidance is not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements61table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedin february 2016 the fasb issued an accounting standards update regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases with a lease term of more than 12 months the update will require additional disclosures regarding key information about leasing arrangements under existing guidance operating leases are not recorded as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet the update will be effective for us beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements however we expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheetsthe fasb issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under us gaap for all companies in all industries effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 including interim periods within that reporting period we expect to adopt this guidance beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2019 using the modified retrospective approach while we are still finalizing our analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard we do not expect it to have a material impact on our

lease financing arrangement for our new headquarters building that entitles us to pay amounts based on a fixed interest rate in exchange for receipt of amounts based on variable interest rates the objective of this interest rate swap is to mitigate variability in the benchmark interest rate on the first 200 million of existing operating lease financing payments this interest rate swap is designated as a cash flow hedge will have settlements beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 and will terminate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 gains or losses on this swap are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and will subsequently be recorded in earnings at the point when the related operating lease financing expense begins to affect earnings or if ineffectiveness of the swap should occurin fiscal year 2017 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total us dollar equivalent notional value of 227 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses we designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur the fair value of the contracts as of january 29 2017 was not significant we also entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a total us dollar equivalent notional value of 99 million to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our reporting currency these foreign currency forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment therefore the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded as a component of other income expense net and offsets the change in fair value of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities which is also recorded in other income expense net under the master netting agreements with the respective counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts we are allowed to net settle transactions with the same counterparty subject to applicable requirements however we present our derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair values on our consolidated balance sheets we are not required to pledge and are not entitled to receive cash collateral related to these derivative instruments as of january 29 2017 the maturities of the designated foreign currency forward contracts were three months or less we formally assess both at inception and on an ongoing basis whether derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment are highly effective during fiscal year 2017 all derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment were determined to be highly effective and there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness for fiscal years 2017 and 2016 we recognized a net change in unrealized gains losses on derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment of 4 million and 4 million respectively net of tax in other comprehensive income losswe expect to realize all gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months however we do not expect to reclassify any amount from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into earnings related to the interest rate swap as the underlying operating lease financing payments for our new headquarters building will not start within the next twelve months75table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuednote 10  guarantees us gaap requires that upon issuance of a

hedgeswe separately accounted for the liability and equity components of the convertible notes at issuance since our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal could be fully or partially settled in cash the liability component was assigned by estimating the fair value of a similar debt without the conversion feature the difference between the net cash proceeds and the

recorded in additional paidincapital was valued at 126 million this equity component together with the 23 million purchasers discount to the par value of the convertible notes represented the initial

determination of such amount is not practicableas of january 29 2017 we had 224 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which 209 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized however approximately 27 million of the unrecognized tax benefits were related to state income tax positions taken that if recognized would be in the form of a carryforward deferred tax asset that would likely attract a full valuation allowance the 209 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of january 29 2017 consisted of 83 million recorded in noncurrent income taxes payable and 126 million

gpus and multicore cpus to drive supercomputing for mobile gaming and entertainment devices as well as autonomous robots drones and carswe have a single unifying architecture for our gpu and tegra processors this architecture unification leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the gpu business while charging the tegra processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business in instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments our codm assigns 100 of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most the all other category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our codm does not assign to either the
