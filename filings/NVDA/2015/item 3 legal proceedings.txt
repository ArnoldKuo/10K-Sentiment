applications and game titles that are optimized for our products7table of contentsbacklog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant seasonalityour gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continuemanufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer supportwe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc byd auto co ltd hon hai precision industry co ltd jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporationwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to contract equipment manufacturers or cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions working capital we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands our existing cash and marketable securities balances decreased by 10 to 462 billion at the end of fiscal year 2015 compared with the end of fiscal year 2014 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve months 8table of contentsresearch and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers we believe in leveraging our significant research and development depth and scale to create differentiated products as of january 25 2015 we had 6658 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 we incurred research and development expense of 136 billion 134 billion and 115 billion respectively competition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market sharea significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of discrete and integrated gpus including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as advanced micro

quality anddelays in product shipments shortages a decrease in product quality andor higher expenses in the event our subcontractors or foundries prioritize our competitors orders over our orders or otherwisewe also rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products and enhancements to market in a timely manner we utilize sophisticated and technologically advanced software development tools to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products and enhancements as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools if we miss design cycles or lose design wins due to the unavailability of such software development tools we could lose market share and our revenues could declineif our products fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields our financial results could be adversely impacted and our reputation with our customers may be harmedmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether a yield problem will exist until our design is actually manufactured by the foundry when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require us and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in higher manufacturing costs and require us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results 14table of contentsbusiness disruptions could harm our business lead to a decline in revenues and increase our costsour worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses a decline in revenue and increase our costs and expenses any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it datacenters are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our thirdparty foundries and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue could decline and our business may be harmedwe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers and our revenue could decline if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2015 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and 13 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal year 2013 the percentage of revenue we receive from our largest customers has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our gpus and tegra processors in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausesubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour customers may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in purchases by them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionwe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customers in the future we may have to record additional provisions or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficientour gross margin depends on a number of factors and changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginour gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products sold average selling prices introduction of new products product transitions sales discounts pricing actions by our competitors the cost of product components and the yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our products we are focused on improving our gross margin and if we are not able to control or estimate the impact of the above factors or other factors we do not foresee our gross margins may be negatively impacted in addition gross margins for our tegra processors are lower than our overall corporate gross margins if tegra processors comprise a higher percentage of our future revenue or if we continue to enter into new business areas with comparatively lower margins our overall gross margins may decline15table of contentsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial results could be harmedwe manufacture our gpus and tegra processors based on estimates of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a customers product that does not materialize in estimating demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in our target markets andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit marketa sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsa higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology or customer requirementsour introduction of new products resulting in lower demand for older products  orincreased competition including competitive pricing actionsin addition the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margins in addition because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be required to writedown our inventory to the lower of cost or market or writeoff excess inventory and we could experience a reduction in average selling prices if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our foundry partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a costeffective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all our customer relationships could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damagedwe are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations which may harm our businesswe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we also generate a significant portion of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and other americas accounted for 75 of total revenue for both fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and 74 of total revenue for fiscal year 2013 the global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties includinginternational economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do businessunexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practiceslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anticorruption laws and regulationsexporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions financial risks such as longer payment cycles difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and foreign exchange rate fluctuations andincreased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations such as carbon taxes fuel or energy taxes and pollution limitsif sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted16table of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products we have in the past and intend to continue to acquire and invest in other businesses that offer products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial resultsdifficulty in combining the technology products operations or workforce of the acquired business with our businessdiversion of capital and other resources including managements attentionassumption of liabilitiesincurring amortization expenses impairment charges to goodwill or writedowns

things andimpairment of relationships with employees vendors and customers or the loss of any of our key employees vendors or customers or our targets key employees vendors or customers as a result of our acquisition or investment     risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other mattersactions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing sowe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements licensing arrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be approved and if approved whether we will be able to enforce such protectionswe have in the past and may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us our employees or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement an unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive reliefwe may commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to protect our intellectual property rights such proceedings may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results further we could be subject to countersuits as a result of our initiation of litigation for example in september 2014 we filed complaints against qualcomm inc and various samsung entities with both the itc and the united states district court for the district of delaware for infringement of seven patents relating to graphics processing in november 2014 various samsung entities filed a complaint against us and velocity micro for alleged infringement of samsungs patents if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results17table of contentsour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could declineour operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future continue to fluctuate due to numerous factors for example our operating expenses represent a significant portion of total revenue and are largely independent of revenue in any particular period in particular our research and development expenses reflect multiyear commitments to the development of new products and enhancements that will not result in revenue if any until future periods therefore investors should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performancefactors that could affect our results of operations in the future includedemand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers productsthe successful development and volume production of our nextgeneration productsour inability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfalls due to multiyear development cycle for some of our products and servicesnew product announcements or product introductions by our competitorsour introduction of new products in accordance with oems design

overall semiconductor industryany one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future financial results any such failure to meet our expectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts could cause our stock price to decline or experience substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer lossesin the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results18table of contentswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligationsin december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100

years after the person becomes an interested shareholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the followingthe ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior shareholder approvalthe prohibition of shareholder action by written consentadvance notice requirements for director nominations and shareholder
