our graphics and mobile technology7table of contentssales and marketingour worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile soc products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our productsin the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2014 to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products backlog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant seasonalityour gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 8table of contentsmanufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer supportwe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporationwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions inventory and working capital we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands  our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 253 to 467 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared with the end of fiscal year 2013 primarily due to our issuance of 15 billion in convertible senior notes in december 2013 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and our intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve monthsresearch and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers we believe in leveraging our significant rampd depth and scale to create differentiated products as of january 26 2014 we had 6384 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred research and development expense of 13358 million 11473 million and 10026 million respectively 9table of contentscompetition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market sharea significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of discrete and integrated gpus including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as advanced micro devices or amd and intel corporationsuppliers of soc products that support tablets smartphones and pcs as well as products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions monitors settop boxes gaming devices and automobiles such as amd arm holdings plc or arm broadcom corporation freescale semiconductor inc hisilicon technologies co ltd

incorporatedlicensors of graphics technologies such as arm and imagination technologies group plc andsuppliers of cellular basebands such as broadcom corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd intel marvell technology group ltd mediatek qualcomm incorporated samsung electronics co ltd and spreadtrum communications co ltdif and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds accelerated processing unit or apu products as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted patents and proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2014 to september 2033 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countriesthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions andthe commercial significance of our operations

increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive and meet the demands of the markets we serve we expect to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development our ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability tocontinue to keep pace with technological developmentsdevelop and introduce new products services technologies and enhancements on a timely basistransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometriesobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials andsucceed in significant foreign markets such as china and indiaif we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intel and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds apu product as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future pc builders and consumers may move away from the use of discrete gpus which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to declinewe are implementing a business strategy to license our gpu cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers although we have engaged in licensing in the past we are now engaging a broader market with new and existing competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies we cannot be assured of the extent of the demand for licenses to our gpu cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio or that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets 13table of contentsour business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessfulin order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make multiyear investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve consumer andor market acceptance of them in a timely mannerour ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability toeffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new marketstimely complete and introduce new products and technologiestransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries andobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materialswe occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have faced challenges in managing product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to sufferif we are unable to achieve consumer and market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmedthe success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as cloudbased computing appliances servers automotive technology smartphones tablets video game consoles and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad consumer and market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such consumer and market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving consumer and market acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will sufferwe believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that weanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers14table of contentsprice our products competitively andintroduce products to the market within our customers limited design cyclesif oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impactedwe depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation furthermore our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarterbecause the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have a readily available alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputationmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results   15table of contentsa decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to consumers of communications and pcrelated products within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to consumers in the smartphone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden because smartphone tablet and pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial resultswe sell our products to a limited number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was approximately 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and approximately 13 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively approximately 23 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 26 2014 and approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient revenue from our largest customer has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausesubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour customers may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition16table of contentsif we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmedto achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levelsour past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operationsour revenue may fluctuate while a majority of our operating expenses are a factor of multiyear investments ahead of when revenue is received which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations our operating expenses are primarily related to multiyear research and development investments ahead of the revenue received from the products which are produced our research and development expenses totaled 134 billion 115 billion and 100 billion in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyany one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operationsbecause our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginwe are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products soldaverage selling pricesintroduction of new productsproduct transitionssales discountsunexpected pricing actions by our competitors17table of contentsthe cost of product components andthe yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our productsif we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial resultswe manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in the semiconductor industry andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market expectations for inflation and energy pricesif there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsif there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirementsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced orif our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actionsany inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business18table of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to

impact our operating resultsunder generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our reporting units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example in the most recent impairment test of our tegra processor reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit only exceeded its carrying value by 17 if the future operating results of the tegra processor reporting unit are significantly lower than our estimates the goodwill assigned to tegra processor could be impaired which would negatively impact our results of operationssystem security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any

to target our security controls in the future and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be able to prevent future breaches of our website andor attacks on our productsportions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our businessour future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business20table of contentswe are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product qualityour products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders because the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing productswe rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating resultsbecause of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the development of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting

that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial resultsour business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn that started in the second half of 2008 ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our

damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable waysthe economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activitiesbusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or

could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial resultsactions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing sowe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsthe location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countries andthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged invalidated infringed circumvented or misappropriated by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement third parties may also claim that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers trade secrets or confidential informationan unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief24table of contentsin addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual propertyenforce our patentsprotect our trade secrets or knowhow ordetermine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of othersif we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our businessif infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accrualsthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxedadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returnschanges in available tax creditschanges in stockbased compensation expensechanges in tax laws the interpretation of tax laws either in the united states or abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance related to transactions and calculations where the tax treatment was previously uncertain andthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 25table of contentsshould additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax lawswe are subject to the risks of owning real propertyduring fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 36 acres of land and twelve commercial buildings and eventually expect to break ground on a new building for a corporate headquarters campus in santa clara we also own real property in india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property includingthe possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with mitigating any environmental problemsadverse

earthquakes floods and or other natural disastersexpensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive positionsince inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1363 million 1367 million and 1364 million for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results   26table of contentswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations       in december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2018 or 100 notes our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligationsplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors andincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditionsthe exercise of warrants issued to goldman sachs amp co or goldman concurrently with our 100 notes would and the conversion of our 100 notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholdersthe warrants issued concurrently with our 100 notes shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless goldman notifies us otherwise any issuance by us of additional shares to goldman upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders moreover the conversion of our 100 notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 100 notes any sales in the public market by goldman of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 100 notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stockour failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilitieswe are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damageenvironmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory27table of contentsthere is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the areas of conflict recent us legislation includes sec disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries for which the first report is due on may 31 2014 for the 2013 calendar year the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals in our products also because our supply chain is complex we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products resulting in reputational challenges with our customers and stockholders some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products although we expect to be able to file the required report on time we are dependent upon the information provided by our many suppliers to the extent that the information we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining such information do not fulfill the secs diligence requirements we could also face sec enforcement risksfuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputationwhile we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may declinesection 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer our chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock   changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operationswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or the interpretation of them can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules such as the possible upcoming changes to revenue recognition and lease accounting standards or changes in practices such as changes to auditing standards promulgated by the public company accounting oversight board could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our businessdelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the followingthe ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approvalthe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent28table of contentsa classified board of directors which will become fully declassified from and after our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposalsthe ability of our

individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more

to shareholders in fiscal year 2015 in the form of share repurchases and dividends as part of our capital return program during february 2014 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement to purchase 5000 million in shares of our common stock please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further discussion critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k   38table of contentsrevenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment  our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimated our customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems the oems are not our direct customers and the quantity and mix of demand they place on cemodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately 05 of total revenue  our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed mdf amounts that have been previously recorded against revenue and subsequently expired unclaimed are reversed to revenue such amounts have not been significant we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period for license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 39table of contentsroyalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee  accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the futureas of january 26 2014 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 08 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 4435 million of the 4435 million 841 million was covered by credit insurance and 231 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit the amount of our cumulative bad debt charges over the last three fiscal years has not been significant as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 01 and 04 during fiscal years 2014 and 2013 as of january 26 2014 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 02 of our gross accounts receivable balance inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout and shipping costs as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts we charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup  situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include changes in business and economic conditions changes in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements failure to estimate customer demand properly for older products as newer products are introduced or unexpected competitive pricing actions by our competition in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory also because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions totaled 501 million 899 million and 530 million unfavorably impacting our gross margin by 12 21 and 13 in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales of inventory that was previously writtenoff or writtendown totaled 434 million 537 million and 711 million favorably impacting our gross margin by 11 13 and 18 in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as a result the overall net effect on our gross margin from charges to cost of sales for inventory provisions and sales of items previously writtenoff or writtendown was a 01 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2014 a 08 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2013 and a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 40table of contentsduring fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 the charges we took to cost of sales for inventory provisions were primarily related to the writeoff of excess quantities of certain older generations of gpu and tegra processor products whose inventory levels were higher than our updated forecasts of future demand for those products as a fabless semiconductor company we must make commitments to purchase inventory based on forecasts of future customer demand in doing so we must account for our thirdparty manufacturers lead times and constraints we also adjust to other market factors such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors new product transitions and macroeconomic conditions  all of which may impact demand for our products please refer to the gross profit and gross margin discussion below in this managements discussion and analysis for further discussion warranty liabilitiescost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field  income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedunited states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedour calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of january 26 2014 we had a valuation allowance of 2445 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodour deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4279 million as of january 26 2014 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operationswe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information41table of contentsgoodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value we have identified three reporting units gpu professional solutions and tegra processor for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis goodwill assigned to these reporting units as of january 26 2014 was 1353 million 951 million and 4128 million respectively determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertainboth a qualitative and quantitative approach are applicable accounting standards for the assessment of goodwill impairment with the qualitative approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform an analysis evaluating factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions the competitive environment the operational stability and overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and actual revenue results for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value no further goodwill impairment testing is required for those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities we estimated the fair value of reporting units by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our businesswhen performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unitduring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 we utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for all three reporting units and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our gpu and professional solutions reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values and the fair value of our tegra processor reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 17 as such even if we applied a hypothetical 10 decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit it still would not have resulted in the fair value of our reporting units being less than their carrying values as an overall test of the reasonableness of estimated fair values of reporting units we reconciled the combined fair value estimates of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of the valuation date of october 27 2013 the reconciliation confirmed that the fair values were relatively representative of the market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization however any significant reductions in the actual amount of future cash flows realized by our reporting units reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair values of our reporting units such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting units42table of contentsin particular the fair value of our tegra reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 17 the fair value of this reporting unit was assessed using a combination of income and market approaches the underlying assumptions we used in assessing the fair value of the tegra reporting unit include but are not limited to assumptions around future revenue growth rates gross margins operating expense investment levels overall market growth rates our market share of the overall market and the appropriate discount rates to apply to future cash flows if the actual future results of the tegra reporting unit do not achieve the levels we estimated in assessing its fair value the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could decline a future decline in the fair value of the tegra reporting unit could result a charge to our earnings as a result of a writedown of the value of the goodwill associated with that reporting unitour next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist such indicators include but are not limited to challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our reporting units which could result in a decrease in fair value and require us to record goodwill impairment charges cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 7 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we do not have any investments classified as level 3 as of january 26 2014all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings  stockbased compensationwe measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization model43table of contentswe determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payoutsour rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield additionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period             using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during fiscal year 2014weighted average expected life in years2435riskfree interest rate1830volatility2837dividend yield1924  we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair

litigation investigation and settlement costs from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costs44table of contentsresults of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain items in our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage

business gpu business revenue for fiscal year 2014 increased by 7 to 347 billion when compared to 325 billion for fiscal year 2013 this growth was largely attributable to strength in our highend geforce gtx gpus which grew 18 driven by gaming market segment demand the gpu business also benefited from a 37 increase in tesla highperformance computing revenue and a 10 increase in quadro workstation revenue in fiscal year 2014 offsetting these growth areas were declines in the overall market for desktop pcs and notebooks which contributed to lower unit volumes of our mainstream geforce gpustegra processor business tegra processor business revenue decreased by 48 to 3980 million for fiscal year 2014 as compared to 7644 million for fiscal year 2013 this decrease was primarily due to lower sales of our previous generation tegra 3based products for smartphones and tablet devices additionally sales of our embedded products for entertainment devices and revenue from license fees related to game consoles also decreased during fiscal year 2014 these decreases were partially offset by the sales of tegra 4based products for smartphones and tablet devices as well as

design wins on the ivy bridge platform strong demand for keplerbased geforce desktop gpu products also contributed to the increase in gpu business revenues the gpu business also benefited from a greater than 36 increase in tesla revenue in fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases were a decrease in quadro revenue which we believe was due primarily to general weakness in western europe and

fiscal year 2013 as compared to 5912 million for fiscal year 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our tegra 3based smartphones and tablet devices as we transitioned from the previous generation tegra 2based products and introduced our tegra3 based processors in windows rtbased tablet devices additionally revenues for our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices also increased during fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue from license fees and other revenue related to game consoles       all other the increase in revenue

reclassificationscertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentationprinciples of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nvidia corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or usgaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies these estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 66table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedrevenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of paymentour policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimatedour customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we account for rebates as a reduction of revenue and accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor while we have a long history of rebate arrangements with oems we believe we are unable to apply our historical experience to reliably estimate the amount of rebates that will eventually be claimed by individual oems the oems are not our direct customers and the quantity and mix of demand they place on cemodms may shift as we introduce new generations and iterations of products and as we experience changes in new competitor offerings in addition we typically find that approximately 95 of the rebates we accrue each year are eventually claimed which is substantially close to 100 and that this percentage varies by program and by customer we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue the amount of which typically represents approximately 05 of total revenueour customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered we account for mdfs as a reduction of revenue and apply a breakage factor to certain types of mdf program accruals for which we believe we can make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the amount that will ultimately be unclaimed mdf amounts that have been previously recorded against revenue and subsequently expired unclaimed are reversed to revenue such amounts have not been significantwe also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returnslicense and development revenuefor license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any periodfor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue 67table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedroyalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licenseeadvertising expenseswe expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred advertising expenses for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 were 131 million 92 million and 84 million respectively rent expense we recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid  product warranties we generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedstockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan is calculated using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization modellitigation investigation and settlement costs from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costsforeign currency remeasurement we use the united states dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into united states dollars at endofperiod exchange rates nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect

are included in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income and to date have not been significantthe impact of gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement included in determining other income expense net for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 was 47 million 15 million and 16 million respectively 68table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the

fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realizedunited states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvestedour calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign

whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordinglyas of january 26 2014 we had a valuation allowance of 2445 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the periodour deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4279 million as of january 26 2014 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operationswe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of

lower of cost or estimated market value or to completely write off obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provisions relate to the writeoff of excess quantities of products based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions once inventory has been writtenoff or writtendown it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently writtenup property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years the estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twenty five years depreciation expense includes the amortization

impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis  for those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities please refer to note 5  of these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information intangible assetsintangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships and are subject to an annual impairment test we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method  71table of contentsnvidia corporation and

reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated accounting for asset retirement obligations  we account for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs the accounting guidance applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset as of january 26 2014 and january 27 2013 our asset retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in santa clara california and certain laboratories at our austin facility and international locations to their original condition upon lease termination were 111 million and 106 million respectivelyadoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements in july 2013 the financial accounting standards

updated guidance requiring entities to report the effect of significant reclassifications to accumulated other comprehensive income on the respective line items in net income these reclassifications are reported only if us gaap requires the entire amount to be reclassified to net income for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in the same reporting period an entity is required to crossreference other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts we adopted this guidance in our interim period ended april 28 2013 the adoption of this guidance did not impact our financial statements as the guidance is related to disclosure only and we

both january 26 2014 and january 27 2013 we expect to recognize the unearned stockbased compensation expense related to rsus over an estimated weighted average amortization period of 27 years

grantdate fair values of 1346 1386 and 1631 per rsu respectively of the estimated total grantdate fair value we estimated that the stockbased compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 was 297 million 271 million and 308 million respectively valuation assumptions we determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yieldfor awards granted on or subsequent to november 8 2012 we use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter additionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience

reporting units and perform our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist for the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis we utilized a quantitative analysis to complete our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values in a qualitative analysis we evaluate factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions the competitive environment the operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and actual revenue results for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value no further goodwill impairment testing is required for those reporting units where a significant change or event has occurred where potential impairment indicators exist or for which we have not performed a quantitative assessment recently we utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test by weighing the results from the income approach and the market approach these valuation approaches consider a number of factors that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rates terminal or residual values discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry and require us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the future profitability of our businesswhen performing an income approach valuation we incorporate the use of projected financial information and a discount rate that are developed using market participant based assumptions to our discounted cash flow model our estimates of discounted cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions the market method of determining the fair

or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the700 million paid and the alleged fair value which difference the trustee estimated to exceed 500 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process89table of

against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 700 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings

gaming devices such as shield it also includes embedded products and license and other revenue associated with game consolesduring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 our codm completed a refinement of the methodology utilized to assign expenses to the gpu and tegra processor businesses to align to the companys product architecture and roadmap with the announcement of our tegra k1 processor we now have a single unifying architecture for our gpu and tegra processors this architecture unification prompted a methodology change that leverages our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the gpu business while charging the tegra processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business in instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reporting segments our codm assigns 100 of those expenses to the reporting segment that benefits the most the
