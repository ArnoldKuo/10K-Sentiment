and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile systemonchip products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products in the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production  as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 13 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013 to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products backlog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant seasonality our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue manufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support10table of contentswe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd siliconware precision industries company ltd and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from nanya technology corporation ibidenco ltd and unimicron technology corporationwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions inventory and working capital we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 191 at the end of fiscal year 2013 compared with the end of fiscal year 2012 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve monthsresearch and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for project shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers as of january 27 2013 we had 5783 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred research and development expense of 11473 million 10026 million and 8488 million respectively competition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share11table of contentsa significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of gpus including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as advanced micro devices or amd and intelsuppliers of soc products that support tablets smartphones and pcs as well as products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions monitors settop boxes gaming devices and cars such

renesas technology corp samsung electronics co ltd spreadtrum communications co ltd and stericsson if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted patents and proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from august 2013 to february 2032 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countriesthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions andthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could sufferemployees as of january 27 2013 we had 7974 employees 5783 of whom were engaged in

10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operationsrisks related to our business industry and partnersif we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impactedthe market for our products is extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do in order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under developmentour ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability tocontinue to keep pace with technological developmentsdevelop and introduce new products services technologies and enhancements on a timely basistransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometriesobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials andsucceed in significant foreign markets such as china and india14table of contentsif we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance or the gpu attach rate if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future our gpu attach rate could decrease which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to declineour business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessfulin order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely mannerour ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability toeffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new marketstimely complete and introduce new products and technologiestransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries andobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materialswe occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to sufferif we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmedthe success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as smartphones tablets and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving marketing acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will sufferadditionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addin card and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the markets do not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 15table of contentswe believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that weanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customersprice our products competitively andintroduce products to the market within our customers limited design cyclesif oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design winsour ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impactedwe depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities may also develop high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier than our thirdparty foundries if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delayswe have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter we experienced continued 28 nanometersupply constraints in the second quarter of fiscal year 201316table of contentsbecause the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputationmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results   business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal information technology or it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer  a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden since pc cell phone and tablet manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results17table of contentswe sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers one customer accounted for 13 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2013 and 11 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2012 and another customer accounted for 12 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2011 approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 and 20 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 29 2012 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausesubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour customers may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionif we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmedto achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levelsour past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operations18table of contentsour revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectationsour operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 369 352 and 326 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter it is also difficult to accurately forecast revenue and we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impactedany one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operationsbecause our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginwe are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products soldaverage selling pricesintroduction of new productsproduct transitionssales discountsunexpected pricing actions by our competitorsthe cost of product components andthe yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our productsif we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial resultsour business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer lossesour stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance19table of contentsin the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities due to changes in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results    our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial resultswe manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in the semiconductor industry andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market expectations for inflation and energy pricesif there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsif there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirementsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced orif our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actionsany inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our businesswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our productswe have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business most recently we completed our acquisition of icera inc an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations product lines and technology of icera we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition which could adversely affect our business plans and operating resultswe may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future acquisitions or investments could impair our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our growth or our financial results20table of contentsdifficulty in combining the technology products operations or

obtain or obtain in a timely manner approvals from governmental authorities which could delay or prevent such acquisitions or investments andimpairment of relationships with employees vendors and customers or the loss of any of our key employees vendors or customers or our targets key employees vendors or customers as a result of our acquisition or investmentin addition the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash shares of our common stock the issuance of convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could negatively impact our ability to pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures we cannot forecast the number timing or size of future strategic investments or acquisitions or the effect that any such investments or acquisitions might have on our operations or financial resultssystem security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems bugs viruses worms malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation

that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputationwe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our businessour future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our businesswe are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product qualityour products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing productswe rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating resultsbecause of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results22table of contentsif our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results during fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 we recorded net warranty charges of 4664 million against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair

united states and other americas as of january 27 2013 we had offices in 16 countries outside of the united states the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united

employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable waysthe economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activitiesour investment portfolio may become impaired by deterioration of the capital marketsour cash equivalent and marketable securities portfolio as of january 27 2013 consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines designed to preserve

governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agenciesshould financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 27 2013 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business for example we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 in addition in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against for alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products as of january 27 2013 we recorded a total cumulative net warranty charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configuration the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs although we believe this issue has been nearly fully remediated we remain committed to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details on these lawsuits  24table of contentsthere can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual propertywe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsthe location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countries andthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties  changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accrualsthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxedadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returnschanges in available tax creditschanges in stockbased compensation expense25table of contentschanges in tax laws the interpretation of tax laws either in the united states or abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance related to transactions and calculations where the tax treatment was previously uncertain andthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax lawslitigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to uswe expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or that we have agreed to indemnify our customers for certain claims of infringementan unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive reliefin addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual propertyenforce our patentsprotect our trade secrets or knowhow ordetermine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of othersif we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultswe are subject to the risks of owning real propertyduring fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings and expect to break ground on a new building for our corporate headquarters campus in santa clara in fiscal year 2014 we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property includingthe possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with mitigating any environmental problemsadverse changes in the value of these properties due to interest rate changes changes in the market in which the property is located or other factorsthe risk of loss if we decide to sell and are not able to recover all capitalized costsincreased cash commitments for the planned

financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance or uninsured risks such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes floods and or other natural disastersexpensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive positionsince inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1367 million 1364 million and 1004 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results   we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating resultsunder us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operationsour failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilitieswe are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damageenvironmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory27table of contentsthere is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the democratic republic of congo new us legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors productsfuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance

404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting

december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 700 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 500 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million 29table of contentsin early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation processon december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustees case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 700 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidias favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court the district courts hearing on the trustees appeal was held on june 10 2009 on december 20

upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue cost of revenue expenses and related disclosure of contingencies on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form 10k   revenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of payment our policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimatedour customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue our customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense depending on the nature of the program mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offeredwe also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns40table of contentslicense and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any periodfor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments management determines this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers the financial institutions providing letters of credit or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain credit insurance in the futureas of january 27 2013 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was 18 million and our gross accounts receivable balance was 4736 million of the 4736 million 711 million was covered by credit insurance and 92 million was covered by letters of credit if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs on certain sales transactions in the future factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit we have incurred cumulative bad debts of 08 million over the last three fiscal years as a result of our low bad debt experience our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between 02 and 04 during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 as of january 27 2013 our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented 04 of our gross accounts receivable balance inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our current inventory or our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down our reported gross margin would be favorably impacted41table of contentsas of january 27 2013 our inventory reserve was 1185 million as a percentage of our gross inventory balance our inventory reserve has ranged between 150 and 306 during fiscal years 2013 and 2012 as of january 27 2013 our inventory reserve represented 220 of our gross inventory balance warranty liabilitiescost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our managements and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results        during the three fiscal years ended january 30 2011 we recorded a cumulative net charge of 4759 million most of which was charged against cost of revenue to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs if the actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial resultsincome taxes we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly   as of january 27 2013 we had a valuation allowance of 2248 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax asset as an income tax benefit during the period  42table of contentsour deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4591 million as of january 27 2013 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operationswe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in

resides to its carrying value we identified four reporting units for the purposes of completing our goodwill analysis determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain in fiscal year 2012 we early adopted an accounting standard update commonly referred to as a step zero approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing for those reporting units where a significant change or events occur and where potential impairment indicators exist we continue to utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing the fair value of our reporting units we use estimates of future revenues costs and cash flows from such units the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities qualitative assessmentin considering the step zero approach to testing goodwill for impairment we perform a qualitative analysis evaluating factors including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions market and industry conditions competitive environment operational stability and the overall financial performance of the reporting units including cost factors and budgetedtoactual revenue results during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we utilized a qualitative analysis for two reporting units where no significant change occurred and no potential impairment indicators arose since the previous annual evaluation of goodwill and concluded it is more likely than not that the fair value of those reporting units is more than their carrying values on a reporting unit basisour next annual evaluation of the goodwill by reporting unit will be performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014 if we were to encounter challenging economic conditions such as a decline in our operating results an unfavorable industry or macroeconomic environment a substantial decline in our stock price or any other adverse change in market conditions we may be required to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment analysis in addition if such conditions have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods whether in connection with our next annual impairment assessment or prior to that if any triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment assessment is performed it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or if it does whether such charge would be material to our results of operations43table of contentsquantitative assessmentwe utilized a quantitative assessment to test goodwill impairment for two reporting units during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 and concluded that there was no impairment as the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 23 and 208 we have considered both the income method and market method where applicable when determining the fair value of reporting units our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting primarily towards the income method to estimate the reporting units fair value the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis while the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium our estimates of cash flow were based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates operating margins riskadjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions our estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to among other things economic conditions changes to our business model or changes in operating performance additionally certain estimates of discounted cash flow involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models which increases the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance the longterm financial forecasts that we utilize represent the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable significant differences between our estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect our future financial results which could impact our future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit the market method of determining the fair value of our reporting unit requires us to use judgment in the selection of appropriate market comparables  any significant reductions in the actual amount of cash flows realized by our reporting unit reductions in the value of market comparables or reductions in our market capitalization could impact future estimates of the fair value of our reporting unit such events could ultimately result in a charge to our earnings in future periods due to the potential for a writedown of the goodwill associated with our reporting unitcash equivalents and marketable securities  cash equivalents consist of financial instruments which are readily convertible into cash and have original maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as available for sale these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss a component of stockholders equity net of tax any unrealized losses which are considered to be otherthantemporary impairments are recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations realized gains losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined using the specificidentification method and recorded in the other income expense section of our consolidated statements of operations please refer to note 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets our level 1 assets consist of our money market funds we classify securities within level 1 assets when the fair value is obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets our availablefor sale securities are classified as having level 2 inputs our level 2 assets are valued utilizing a market approach where the market prices of similar assets are provided by a variety of independent industry standard data providers to our investment custodian most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level 2 inputs we do not have any investment classified as level 3 as of january 27 2013all of our availableforsale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review we record a charge to earnings when a decline in fair value is significantly below cost basis and judged to be otherthantemporary or have other indicators of impairments if the fair value of an availableforsale debt instrument is less than its amortized cost basis an otherthan  temporary impairment is triggered in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthan temporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis amortized cost basis less any currentperiod credit loss we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings 44table of contents stockbased compensation we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units or rsus we calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization modelwe determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we also segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumption of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payoutsprior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on november 8 2012 the fair value of our equity awards was based on an expected dividend yield of 0 reflecting our prior history in which we had not paid and did not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to november 8 2012 we now use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yield          additionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period          using the binomial model we estimated the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans using the following assumptions during fiscal year 2013weighted average expected life in years3149riskfree interest rate1523volatility3949dividend yield24  we used the blackscholes model to estimate the fair value of shares issued under our espp

and settlement costs from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costsresults of

increase of 71 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as followsgpu business gpu business revenue increased by 20 to 32517 million for fiscal year 2013 when compared to 31868 million for fiscal year 2012 this growth was largely attributable to the introduction of gpus based on our kepler architecture in fiscal year 2013 geforce notebook revenues increased on the strength of keplerbased design wins on the ivy bridge platform strong demand for keplerbased geforce desktop gpu products also contributed to the increase in gpu business revenues the gpu business also benefited from a greater than 360 increase in tesla revenue in fiscal 2013 offsetting these increases were a decrease in quadro revenue which we believe was due primarily to general weakness in western europe and a continued decline in sales of our mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line 46table of contentstegra processor business tegra processor business revenue increased by 293 to 7644 million for fiscal year 2013 as compared to 5912 million for fiscal year 2012 this increase was primarily due to higher sales of our tegra 3based smartphones and tablet devices as we transitioned from the previous generation tegra 2based products and introduced our tegra3 based processors in windows rtbased tablet devices additionally revenues for our embedded products for entertainment and automotive devices also increased during fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenue from license fees and other revenue related to game consolesall other the increase in revenue is also due to revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement we entered into with intel in january 2011 we recognized 2640 million in related licensing revenue during the entire twelve months of fiscal year 2013 while fiscal year 2012 only included 2200 million in related revenue  reflecting only ten months of the corresponding revenue fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 revenue was 400 billion for fiscal year 2012 and 354 billion for fiscal year 2011 an increase of 128 a discussion of our revenue results for each of our reporting segments and the other category is as followsgpu business gpu business revenue decreased by 48 to 31868 million for fiscal year 2012 when compared to 33457 million for fiscal year 2011 the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in sales of mcp products as we continued to phase out our chipset product line memory sales also decreased due to lower sales volume as decreases in market price for memory made it attractive for addin card manufacturers to buy memory directly from the market rather than from us additionally our tesla product revenues decreased from the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume offsetting these decreases were increases in geforce desktop and notebook revenues from continued market penetration of our fermi architecturebased gpus strength of our fermi architecture and resultant design wins on the sandy bridge platform contributed to the increase in geforce notebook revenues quadro revenues improved slightly as the average selling price or asp for workstation products improved due to the recovery of corporate spending following the economic recession that began during fiscal year 2009 tegra processor business tegra processor business revenue increased by 1992 to 5912 million for fiscal year 2012 as compared to 1976 million for fiscal year 2011 this increase in revenue was primarily driven by sales growth from the acceleration of our tegra 2 smartphone and tablet products in the mobile market and in embedded product revenues primarily related to the entertainment markets revenue from development arrangements and license fees related to game consoles remained stable in fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011       all other revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of 2200 million of licensing revenue in fiscal year 2012 from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel that we entered into in january 2011 and began recognizing in april 2011 concentration of revenue we generated 74 78 and 83 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers addin board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different locationrevenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue for the respective dates is summarized

net of allowances less cost of revenue cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory and warranty provisions and shipping costs cost of revenue also includes development costs for license service arrangements and stockbased compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue our gross margin was 520 514 and 398 for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell and can vary in any period depending on that product mixour strategy for improving our gross margin relies upon delivering competitive product offerings that allow us to maintain our market leadership position and expand our addressable markets lowering our product costs by introducing product architectures that take advantage of smaller process geometries and improving our product mix however we may experience difficulties in the transition to new manufacturing processes we expect gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 to stay flat relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013  a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reporting segments is as followsfiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012our gross margin increased to 520 in fiscal year 2013 from 514 in fiscal year 2012 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by increased unit sales and a richer product mix of our highend geforce desktop products plus tesla and quadro products the addition of a full year of revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel compared to ten months of such corresponding revenue in fiscal year 2012 also contributed to the improvement in gross margin offsetting these were the unfavorable impact of higher net provisions for inventory in fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 our gross margin is favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 13 and 18 in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively conversely our gross margin is unfavorably impacted by provisions for new inventory reserves the overall net effect on our gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 08 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 2013 and a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 gpu business the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2013 when compared to fiscal year 2012 this was primarily due to a richer product mix of our keplerbased highend 28 nanometer geforce desktop products and our quadro products memory margins strengthened on improved market pricing these favorable contributors to gross margin were primarily offset by higher net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012   tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased slightly during fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2012 this decrease was the result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of revenue from areas such as license fees and other revenues related to game consoles which typically have higher gross margins than our tegra products offset by a higher mix of revenue from sales of our tegra products which grew substantially during the year fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011our gross margin increased to 514 in fiscal year 2012 from 398 in fiscal year 2011 the improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by revenue from the patent cross licensing arrangement with intel entered into in january 2011 additionally the increase in unit sales and a richer product mix of our geforce desktop and notebook products and quadro workstation products as well as manufacturing cost efficiencies and strong management of inventory also helped our gross margin improve in fiscal year 2012 other favorable impacts to gross margin were the absence in fiscal year 2012 of a net charge to cost of revenue in the amount of 1812 million recorded in fiscal year 2011 related to a weak diepacking material set and lower provisions for net inventory reserves in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 our gross margin was favorably impacted by sales of products that were previously written down and sales of such items improved gross margin by approximately 18 and 19 in fiscal years 2012 and 2011 respectively offsetting these releases are provisions for new inventory reserves the net effect to gross margin from inventory reserves and sales of items previously written down was a 05 favorable impact in fiscal year 2012 and a 30 unfavorable impact in fiscal year 201148table of contents gpu business the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year 2012 when compared to fiscal year 2011 this was primarily due to lower net provisions for inventory in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 and additional warranty accruals arising from a weak diepackaging material set recorded in fiscal year 2011 higher unit sales and richer product mix of our geforce desktop and notebook products also improved gross margin for the gpu business in addition the gross margin for both quadro and tesla products remained stable during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 tegra processor business the gross margin of our tegra processor business decreased during fiscal year 2012 as compared to fiscal year 2011 this decrease was a result of a change in product mix driven by a lower mix of license fees and other revenue related to game

million or 144 year over year this increase was primarily due to a 994 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to hire engineering talent to invest in our business depreciation and amortization increased by 98 million driven primarily by amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisition of icera in fiscal year 2012 as well as purchases of additional hardware and licenses during the year engineering development expenses increased by 68 million related to the ramp of our nextgeneration gpu architecture kepler designed for 28nm technology and our next generation tegra processor architecture tegra 4 fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011research and development expenses increased by 1538 million or 181 year over year this increase was primarily driven by investments in our efforts to build next generation energy efficient computing architectures these efforts resulted in a 837 million increase in compensation and benefits expense and a 225 million increase in stockbased compensation development expenses increased by 90 million related to the ramp of our kepler gpu architecture designed for 28nm technology and our tegra 3 mobile computing architecture depreciation and amortization increased by 88 million driven primarily by amortization of licenses acquired during the year also contributing to the increase were other acquisitionrelated costs of 124 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we established for employees from our acquisition of icera in june 2011 and 60 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with this acquisition49table of contentssales general and administrativefiscal year 2013 vs fiscal year 2012 sales general and administrative expenses increased by 252 million or 62 year over year this increase was primarily due to a 216 million increase in compensation and benefits expense as we continue to invest in our business also contributing to the increase was a 201 million expense for the net present value of a charitable contribution that we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013 offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 104 million due to an overall decrease in professional services costs during fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal year 2012 due to a general decline in litigationrelated costs and the absence of services associated with acquisition activity in fiscal year 2013 fiscal year 2012 vs fiscal year 2011 sales general and administrative expenses increased by 441 million or 122 year over year compensation and benefits expense increased by 295 million primarily attributable to employee personnel growth stockbased compensation increased by 105 million primarily due to a combination of a higher outlay of equity awards as a result of the increase in employee personnel also contributing to the increase were 44 million of transaction costs related to the acquisition of icera 35 million for compensation charges related to the retention program we established for icera employees and 22 million of amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the icera acquisition offsetting these increases were decreases in outside professional fees of 40 million due to lower litigationrelated costs and a decrease in depreciation and amortization of 92 million due to certain software and leasehold improvements of buildings that became fully depreciated during fiscal year 2012legal settlement on january 10 2011 we entered into a sixyear cross licensing agreement with intel and also mutually agreed to settle all outstanding legal disputes the fair valued benefit prescribed to the legal settlement portion was 570 million and was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011we expect operating expenses to increase in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 primarily due to employeerelated costs including supporting infrastructure costs related to planned hiring interest income and interest expense interest income net of interest expense consists of interest earned on cash cash equivalents and marketable securities interest income net of interest expense was 166 million 161 million and 159 million in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively this increase was primarily due to the result of higher average cash balances offset by lower interest rates other income and expenseother income and expense primarily consists of realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and foreign currency translation other expense net of other income was 28 million 10 million and 05 million in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively these changes were primarily driven by an increase in foreign currency translation losses    income taxes we recognized income tax expense of 995 million 823 million and 180 million during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes or our annual effective tax rate was 150 124 and 67 in fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectivelyour effective tax rate on income or loss before tax for the fiscal years was lower than the united states federal statutory rate of 35 due to income or loss earned in jurisdictions including british virgin islands hong kong china taiwan and united kingdom where the tax rate is lower than the united states federal statutory tax rate of 35 favorable recognition in these fiscal years of the us federal research tax credit and the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain nonus jurisdictions for which we had not previously recognized related tax benefitswe expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 16 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 excluding any discrete tax events that may occur which if realized may increase or decrease our effective tax rate in such quarter 50table of contentsplease refer to note 14 of the

asset types and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration operating activities operating activities generated cash of 8242 million 9092 million and 6758 million during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectivelycash provided by operating activities decreased in fiscal year 2013 compared to fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a decrease in net income and unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2012 for example accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012 and inventory increased as a result of the production ramp of keplerbased gpu products cash provided by operating activities increased in fiscal year 2012 compared to fiscal year 2011 primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to fiscal year 2011 for example accounts payable increased as a result of the timing of payments to vendors and inventory decreased as a result of an increase in inventory turnover higher noncash charges in earnings including stockbased compensation and depreciation and amortization also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities investing activities investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and sales of marketable securities acquisition of businesses and purchases of property and equipment which include leasehold improvements for our facilities and intangible assets investing activities used cash of 7440 million 11434 million and 6497 million during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2013 decreased by 3994 million from fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the acquisition of

activities in fiscal year 2013 was primarily due to our repurchase of 1000 million of common stock and our firstever cash dividend payments of 469 million these uses of cash were offset by cash proceeds of 649 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a noncash tax benefit of 687 million related to employee stockbased compensationcash provided by financing activities in fiscal year 2012 was primarily due to cash proceeds of 1959 million from common stock issued under our employee stock plans and a noncash tax benefit of 528 million related to employee stockbased compensationliquidityour primary source of liquidity is cash generated by our operations our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents commercial paper mortgagebacked

denominated in united states dollars as of january 27 2013 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securitiesall of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if

receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy three customers accounted for approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance at january 27 2013 while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments additional allowances may be required we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums any of which could adversely affect our operating results in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world including substantial amounts held outside of the united states as of january 27 2013 we had cash cash equivalents and marketable securities of 180 billion held within the united states and 193 billion held outside of the united states most of the amounts held outside the united states may be repatriated to the united states but under current law would be subject to us federal income taxes less applicable foreign tax credits further repatriation of some foreign balances may be restricted by local laws as of january 27 2013 we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on approximately 168 billion of undistributed earnings of nonunited states subsidiaries as such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the united states although we have no current need to do so if we repatriate foreign earnings for cash requirements in the united states we would incur us federal and state income tax less applicable foreign tax credits and reduced by the current amount of our us federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards further in addition to the 180 billion of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held within the united states and available to fund our us operations and any other us cash needs we have access to external sources of financing if cash is needed in the united states other than by repatriation of

common stock on november 8 2012 we announced the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend program this quarterly dividend of 0075 per share is equivalent to 030 per share on an annual basis the initial cash dividend was paid on december 14 2012 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on november 23 2012 a subsequent cash dividend of 0075 per share was declared on february 13 2013 payable on march 21 2013 to all common stockholders of record at the close of business on february 28 2013 in fiscal year 2013 we paid 469 million in dividends to our common stockholdersour cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to continued capital availability and our board of directors continuing determination that the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of nvidia applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividendsoperating capital and capital expenditure requirements  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition stock repurchase cash dividend and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months however there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our thencurrent stockholders we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures which could harm our business factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and as a result our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products andor our customers productsinability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our nextgeneration productscompetitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices andnew product announcements or product introductions by our competitorswe expect to spend approximately 2400 million to 2800 million for capital expenditures during fiscal year 2014 primarily for property development leasehold improvements software licenses emulation equipment computers and engineering workstations in fiscal year 2014 we expect to break ground on a new building for our headquarters campus in santa clara to provide for our nearterm growth needs this 500000 square foot building will provide 2500 seats and be built on land we purchased five years ago we estimate capital funding of 320 million for the campus development project in fiscal year 2014 in addition we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assetsfor additional factors see item 1a risk factors  risks related to our business industry and partners  our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations   54table of contentsproduct defectour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our managements and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field which could cause our revenue to decline a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results during the three year period ended january 30 2011 we recorded a cumulative net charge of 4759 million most of which was charged against cost of revenue to cover customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook configurations determining the amount of the warranty charges related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return and replacement and other associated costs if the actual repair return replacement and other associated costs andor actual field failure rates exceed our estimates we may be required to record additional reserves which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results    contractual obligationsthe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january 27 2013 payment due by periodcontractual obligationstotal less

7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinvestment and interest rate risk as of january 27 2013 and january 29 2012 we had 373 billion and 313 billion respectively in cash cash

securities issued by governmentsponsored enterprises money market funds and debt securities of corporations municipalities and the united states government and its agencies as of january 27 2013 we did not have any investments in auctionrate preferred securities our investments are denominated in united states dollars  all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as availableforsale investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall due in part to these factors our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be otherthantemporary we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates however because any debt securities we hold are classified as availableforsale no gains or

net of tax as of january 27 2013 we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments according to our analysis parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus 05 would result in changes in fair values for these investments of approximately 204 million the financial turmoil that affected the banking system and financial markets and increased the possibility that financial institutions might consolidate or go out of business resulted in a tightening in the credit markets a low level of liquidity in many financial markets and extreme volatility in fixed income credit currency and equity markets there could be a number of followon effects from the credit crisis on our business including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays inability of customers including channel partners to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products andor customer including channel partner insolvencies and failure of financial institutions which may negatively impact our treasury operations other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments interest rates and cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances volatility in the financial markets and economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them as of january 27 2013 our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately 56 of our total investment portfolio while the financial sector accounted for approximately 19 of our total investment portfolio substantially all of our investments are with aa2 or better rated securities if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by 25 the fair values of these investments would decline by approximately 49123 million exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other expense net in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant the impact of foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 was 15 million 16 million and 24 million respectively currently sales and arrangements with thirdparty manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive which could negatively impact our ability to compete conversely decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 56table of

delaware in april 1998 all references to nvidia we us our or the company mean nvidia corporation and its subsidiaries except where it is made clear that the term means only the parent company fiscal year we operate on a 52 or a 53week year ending on the last sunday in january fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 were 52week years   reclassificationscertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentationprinciples of consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nvidia corporation and its whollyowned subsidiaries all material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 69table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinueduse of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or usgaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalents and marketable securities accounts receivable inventories income taxes goodwill stockbased compensation warranty liabilities litigation investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies these estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable revenue recognition product revenuewe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the product has been delivered the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured for most sales we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer at the point of sale we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of paymentour policy on sales to certain distributors with rights of return is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product as the level of returns cannot be reasonably estimatedour customer programs primarily involve rebates which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets we accrue for 100 of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor we recognize a liability for these rebates at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the rebate rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenueour customer programs also include marketing development funds or mdfs we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense depending on the nature of the program mdfs represent monies paid to retailers system builders original equipment manufacturers or oems distributors and addin card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting nvidia products depending on market conditions we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offeredwe also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rates however if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returnslicense and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components we generally recognize the related revenue over the period that services are performed for most license and service arrangements we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period70table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedfor license arrangements that do not require significant customization but where we are obligated to provide further deliverables over the term of the license agreement we record revenue over the of life of the license term with consideration received in advance of the performance period classified as deferred revenue royalty revenue is recognized related to the distribution or sale of products that use our technologies under license agreements with third parties we recognize royalty revenue upon receipt of a confirmation of earned royalties and when collectability is reasonably assured from the applicable licensee advertising expenses we expense advertising costs in the period in which they are incurred advertising expenses for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 were 92 million 84 million and 95 million respectively rent expense we recognize rent expense on a straightline basis over the lease period and accrue for rent expense incurred but not paid  product warranties we generally offer limited warranty to endusers that ranges from one to three years for products in order to repair or replace products for any manufacturing defects or hardware component failures cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstances we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimatedstockbased compensation            we measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of restricted stock units we calculate the fair value of our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholes model our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated amortization modellitigation investigation and settlement costs from time to time we are involved in legal actions andor investigations by regulatory bodies we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters  however there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation and we cannot be certain that these actions or other thirdparty claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation fines andor substantial settlement payments if that occurs our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation investigations or settlements is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events we will record the loss in accordance with us gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimates which could require us to record additional costsforeign currency remeasurement we use the united states dollar as our functional currency for all of our subsidiaries foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured into united states dollars at endofperiod exchange rates nonmonetary assets and liabilities such as property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period except for those expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other expense net in our consolidated statements of income and to date have not been significantthe impact of net foreign currency transaction gain loss included in determining net income for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 was 15 million 16 million and 24 million respectively 71table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedincome taxes  we recognize federal state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities as appropriate for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized united states income tax has not been provided on a portion of earnings of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states or foreign jurisdictions where we operate or changes in other facts or circumstances in addition we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes may be due if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly as of january 27 2013 we had a valuation allowance of 2248 million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due in part to projections of future taxable income and potential utilization limitations of tax attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikelythannot we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stockbased compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of 4591 million as of january 27 2013 consistent with prior years the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity if and when realized in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized we have elected to utilize the withandwithout approach with respect to such excess tax benefits we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stockbased compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from operationswe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is morelikelythannot that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense please refer to note 14 of these notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information    comprehensive income  comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss components

during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the effect of stock options outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for periods when their effect is antidilutivecash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents as of january 27 2013 and january 29 2012 our cash and cash equivalents were 7328 million and 6679 million respectively which include 1958 million and 2907 million invested in money market funds for fiscal year 2013 and fiscal year 2012 respectively72table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedmarketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid investments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased we generally classify our marketable securities at the date of acquisition as

in circumstances where 1 we intend to sell the instrument 2 it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis or 3 a credit loss exists where we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the instrument if we intend to sell or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the availableforsale debt instrument before recovery of its amortized cost basis we recognize an otherthantemporary impairment in earnings equal to the entire difference between the debt instruments amortized cost basis and its fair value for availableforsale debt instruments that are considered otherthantemporarily impaired due to the existence of a credit loss if we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than

impairment into the amount that is credit related and the amount due to all other factors the credit loss component is recognized in earnings while loss related to all other factors is recorded as other comprehensive income  we performed an impairment review of our investment portfolio as of january 27 2013 based on our impairment review and having considered the guidance of the relevant accounting literature we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges during fiscal year 2013 we concluded that our investments were appropriately valued and that no other than temporary impairment charges were necessary on our portfolio of available for sale investments as of january 27 2013   fair value of financial instruments the carrying value of cash cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their relatively short maturities as of january 27 2013 and january 29 2012 marketable securities are comprised of availableforsale securities that are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity net of tax fair value of the marketable securities is determined based on quoted market prices concentration of credit risk  financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable securities and accounts receivable our investment policy requires the purchase of toptier investment grade securities the diversification of asset type and includes certain limits on our portfolio duration all marketable securities are held in our name managed by several investment managers and held by one major financial institution under a custodial arrangement accounts receivable from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total accounts receivable aggregated approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance from three customers at january 27 2013 and approximately 20 of our accounts receivable balance from one customer at january 29 2012 we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit  accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments we determine this allowance which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit73table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinued inventoriesinventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis which approximates actual cost on an average or firstin firstout basis inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases final test yield fallout inventory provisions and shipping costs we write down our inventory to the lower of cost or estimated market value excess obsolete or unmarketable inventory is completely written off based upon assumptions about future demand future product purchase commitments estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if our current inventory or future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products additional future inventory writedowns may be required that could adversely affect our operating results inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped if actual market conditions are more favorable than expected and we sell products that we have previously written down our reported gross margin would be favorably impactedproperty and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straightline method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets generally three to five years the estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to twentyfive years depreciation expense includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases leasehold improvements and assets recorded under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the assetgoodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist for the purposes of completing our impairment test we perform either a qualitative or a quantitative analysis on a reporting unit basis in fiscal year 2012 we early adopted an accounting standard update commonly referred to as a step zero approach that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep quantitative goodwill impairment test for reporting units in which the qualitative assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value the amended guidance eliminates the requirement to perform further goodwill impairment testing for those reporting units where significant change or events occur and where potential impairment indicators exist we continue to utilize a twostep quantitative assessment to testing goodwill for impairment the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair valuebased test in computing fair value of our reporting units we considered both the income method and market method where applicable the income method is based on a discounted future cash flow analysis while the market method is based on financial multiples of comparable companies and applies a control premium our goodwill impairment test uses a weighting primarily towards the income method to estimate the reporting units fair value the second step if necessary measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair valuebased tests to individual assets and liabilities intangible assetsintangible assets primarily represent rights acquired under technology licenses patents acquired intellectual property trademarks and customer relationships we currently amortize our intangible assets with definitive lives over periods ranging from one to ten years using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern cannot be reliably determined using a straightline amortization method74table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinued impairment of longlived assets  longlived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and would no longer be depreciated accounting for asset retirement obligations  we account for asset retirement obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs the accounting guidance applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of longlived assets that result from the acquisition construction development andor normal use of the assets and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset as of january 27 2013 and january 29 2012 our asset retirement obligations to return the leasehold improvements at our headquarters facility in santa clara california and certain laboratories at our austin facility and international locations to their original condition upon lease termination were 106 million and 102 million respectivelyadoption of new and recently issued accounting pronouncements in the third quarter of fiscal year 2013 we adopted an amended standard that simplifies how entities test indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment which improves consistency in impairment testing requirements among longlived asset categories this amended standard permits an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset is less than its carrying value for assets for which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value these amended standards eliminate the requirement to perform quantitative impairment testing as outlined in the previously issued standard this new standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statementsin the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we adopted an amended standard that increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income this amended standard eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity and requires that all changes in stockholders equity  except investments by and distributions to owners  be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the adoption of this amended standard impacted the presentation of other comprehensive income as we have elected to present two separate but consecutive statements but did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operationsnote 2  stockbased compensationwe measure stockbased compensation expense based on the estimated fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognize the expense using a straightline attribution method over the requisite employee service period we estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model and we use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus a dividend yield discount as the fair value of awards of rsus we estimate the fair value of shares to be issued our employee stock purchase plan using the blackscholes at the commencement of an offering period in march and september each year our stockbased compensation for employee stock purchase plan is expensed using an accelerated

a net charge of 04 million  01 million and 07 million in cost of revenue during the fiscal years ended january 27 2013  january 29 2012 and january 30 2011 respectively during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we granted approximately 71 million 64 million and 58 million stock options respectively with estimated total grantdate fair values of 383 million 524 million and 344 million respectively and weighted average grantdate fair values of 538 816 and 589 per option respectively during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we granted approximately 81 million 73 million and 71 million rsus respectively with estimated total grantdate fair values of 1128 million 1197 million and 967 million respectively and weighted average grantdate fair values of 1386 1631 and 1361 per rsu respectively of the estimated total grantdate fair value we estimated that the stockbased compensation expense related to the equity awards that are not expected to vest for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 was 271 million 308 million and 235 million respectively valuation assumptions we determine the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an optionpricing model that is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables these variables include but are not limited to weighted average expected term riskfree interest rate expected stock price volatility dividend yield actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors vesting schedules and death and disability probabilities we segregate options into groups of employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model the expected life of employee stock options is a derived output of our valuation model and is impacted by the underlying assumptions of our company the riskfree interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on treasury bills appropriate for the term of our employee stock options our management has determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and therefore can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility dividend yield is based on history and expectation of dividend payouts our rsu awards are not eligible for cash dividends prior to vesting therefore the fair value of rsus is discounted by the dividend yieldprior to the initial declaration of a quarterly cash dividend on november 8 2012 the fair value of our equity awards was based on an expected dividend yield of 0 reflecting our prior history in which we had not paid and did not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock for awards granted on or subsequent to november 8 2012 we now use a dividend yield at grant date based on the per share dividends declared during the most recent quarter 76table of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementscontinuedadditionally for employee stock option and rsu awards we estimate forfeitures annually and revise the estimates of forfeiture in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards in future periods the compensation expense that we record under these accounting standards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current

product returns could be expensive damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be

agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the700 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 500 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million in early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation processon december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustees case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 700 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidias favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states

judgment in nvidias favor on january 19 2011 the trustee filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit the appeal is currently pendingwhile the conditional settlement reached in november 2005 never progressed through the confirmation process the trustees case still remains pending on appeal accordingly we have not reversed the accrual of 306 million  56
