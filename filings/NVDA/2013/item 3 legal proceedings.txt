property components and further enhance the reach of our graphics and mobile technology9table of contentssales and marketingour worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile systemonchip products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our products in the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production  as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 13 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2013 to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software titles that are optimized for our products backlog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant seasonality our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market historically we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year primarily due to backtoschool and holiday demand however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue manufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer support10table of contentswe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd siliconware precision industries company ltd and stats chippac incorporated to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from nanya technology corporation ibidenco ltd and unimicron technology corporationwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions inventory and working capital we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 191 at the end of fiscal year 2013 compared with the end of fiscal year 2012 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve monthsresearch and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for project shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers as of january 27 2013 we had 5783 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 we incurred research and development expense of 11473 million 10026 million and 8488 million respectively competition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share11table of contentsa significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of gpus including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as advanced micro devices or amd and intelsuppliers of soc products that support tablets smartphones and pcs as well as products that are

and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted patents and proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from august 2013 to february 2032 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countriesthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions andthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties the enforcement of patents by others may harm our ability to conduct our business others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business we have licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in some of our products and for defensive reasons and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements these licenses may result in royalty payments to third parties the cross licensing of technology by us or payment of other consideration if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could sufferemployees as of january 27 2013 we had 7974 employees 5783 of whom were engaged in research and development and 2191 of whom were engaged in sales marketing operations and

and distribution resources than we do in order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under developmentour ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability tocontinue to keep pace with technological developmentsdevelop and introduce new products services technologies and enhancements on a timely basistransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometriesobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials andsucceed in significant foreign markets such as china and india14table of contentsif we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by amds apu product and intels cpus with integrated graphics as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance or the gpu attach rate if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future our gpu attach rate could decrease which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to declineour business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessfulin order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make longterm investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve market acceptance of them in a timely mannerour ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability toeffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new marketstimely complete and introduce new products and technologiestransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries andobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materialswe occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have been unable to successfully manage product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to sufferif we are unable to achieve market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmedthe success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as smartphones tablets and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving marketing acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will sufferadditionally there can be no assurance that the industry will continue to demand new products with improved standards features or performance if our customers original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms addin card and motherboard manufacturers system builders and consumer electronics companies do not continue to design products that require more advanced or efficient processors andor the markets do not continue to demand new products with increased performance features functionality or standards sales of our products could decline and the markets for our products could shrink decreased sales of our products for these markets could negatively impact our revenue and our financial results 15table of contentswe believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that weanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customersprice our products competitively andintroduce products to the market within our customers limited design cyclesif oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration therefore we endeavor to develop close relationships with our oems and odms in an attempt to better anticipate and address customer needs in new products so that we will achieve design winsour ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impactedwe depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation we use the most advanced manufacturing process technology appropriate for our products that is available from our thirdparty foundries as a result we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating our products to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development which could negatively impact our operating expenses and gross margin our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis our competitors including those that own their own manufacturing facilities may also develop high quality leadingedge process technologies earlier than our thirdparty foundries if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delayswe have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes in the past and consequently have suffered reduced yields delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarter we experienced continued 28 nanometersupply constraints in the second quarter of fiscal year 201316table of contentsbecause the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have an alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputationmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results   business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal information technology or it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water shortages information technology system failures military actions or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issues the ultimate impact on us our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown however in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster or catastrophic event our revenue profitability and financial condition could suffer  a decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to customers in the communications and computerrelated industries within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to customers in the cell phone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden since pc cell phone and tablet manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial results17table of contentswe sell our products to a small number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers one customer accounted for 13 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2013 and 11 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2012 and another customer accounted for 12 of our total revenue in fiscal year 2011 approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 and 20 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 29 2012 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausesubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour customers may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial conditionif we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmedto achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levelsour past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operations18table of contentsour revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectationsour operating expenses are relatively fixed and largely independent of revenue therefore it is difficult for us to accurately forecast profits or losses in any particular period our operating expenses which are comprised of research and development expenses and sales general and administrative expenses represented 369 352 and 326 of our total revenue for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively since we often recognize a substantial portion of our revenue in the last month of each quarter it is also difficult to accurately forecast revenue and we may not be able to adjust our operating expenses in a timely manner in response to any unanticipated revenue shortfalls in any quarter further some of our operating expenses like stockbased compensation expense can only be adjusted over a longer period of time and cannot be reduced during a quarter if we are unable to reduce operating expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls our financial results will be negatively impactedany one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operationsbecause our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginwe are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products soldaverage selling pricesintroduction of new productsproduct transitionssales discountsunexpected pricing actions by our competitorsthe cost of product components andthe yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our productsif we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline our business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial resultsour business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will suffer our stock price continues to be volatile and investors may suffer lossesour stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance19table of contentsin the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities due to changes in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results    our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial resultswe manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in the semiconductor industry andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market expectations for inflation and energy pricesif there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsif there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirementsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced orif our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actionsany inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our businesswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition targets which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new products or sell our productswe have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business most recently we completed our acquisition of icera inc an innovator of baseband processors for 3g and 4g cellular phones and tablets such a transaction can involve significant integration challenges and there can be no assurance that preacquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to the acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the acquired operations product lines and technology of icera we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition which could adversely affect our business plans and operating resultswe may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company resources any of the following risks associated with past or future

convertible debt securities or a combination of cash convertible debt and common stock if we make an investment in cash or use cash to pay for all or a portion of an acquisition our cash reserves would be reduced which could negatively impact the growth of our business or our ability to develop new products however if we pay the consideration with shares of common stock or convertible debentures the holdings of our existing stockholders would be diluted a significant decline in the trading price of our common stock would make the dilution to our stockholders more extreme and could

may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our businessour future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees without an adequate replacement or our inability to hire new employees as needed could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our businesswe are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product qualityour products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors since we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders since the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing productswe rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating resultsbecause of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results22table of contentsif our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs

financial market conditions worsen in the future investments in some financial instruments may pose risks arising from market liquidity and credit concerns in addition any deterioration of the capital markets could cause our other income and expense to vary from expectations as of january 27 2013 we had no material impairment charges associated with our shortterm investment portfolio and although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or credit availability and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired risks related to regulatory legal our common stock and other matters we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business for example we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 in addition in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against for alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products as of january 27 2013 we recorded a total cumulative net warranty charge of 4759 million of which 4664 million has been charged against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty repair return replacement and other costs arising from a weak diepackaging material set used in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products shipped after july 2008 and used in notebook configuration the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates testing suggests a weak material set of diepackage combination system thermal management designs and customer use patterns are contributing factors for these failures we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the products in their notebook system designs although we believe this issue has been nearly fully remediated we remain committed to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted products that fail and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations however we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other products please refer to note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details on these lawsuits  24table of contentsthere can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results   our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual propertywe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsthe location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countries andthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties  changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united states taxes on such indefinitely reinvested nonunited states earnings eliminate certain tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the united states andor otherwise cause the total tax cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accrualsthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxedadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returnschanges in available tax creditschanges in stockbased compensation expense25table of contentschanges in tax laws the interpretation of tax laws either in the united states or abroad or the issuance of new interpretative accounting guidance related to transactions and calculations where the tax treatment was previously uncertain andthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities should additional taxes be assessed as a result of any of the above our operating results could be adversely affected in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax laws or changes in the interpretation of tax lawslitigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights and the outcome of such litigation could result in substantial costs to uswe expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or that we have agreed to indemnify our customers for certain claims of infringementan unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive reliefin addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual propertyenforce our patentsprotect our trade secrets or knowhow ordetermine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of othersif we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our business if infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnified customers may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnified customers is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating resultswe are subject to the risks of owning real propertyduring fiscal year 2009 we purchased real property in santa clara california that includes approximately 25 acres of land and ten commercial buildings and expect to break ground on a new building for our corporate headquarters campus in santa clara in fiscal year 2014 we also own real property in china and india we have limited experience in the ownership and management of real property and are subject to the risks of owning real property includingthe possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with mitigating any environmental problemsadverse changes in the value of these properties due to interest rate changes changes in

financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance or uninsured risks such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes floods and or other natural disastersexpensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive positionsince inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in united states of america or us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1367 million 1364 million and 1004 million for fiscal years 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results   we may be required to record a charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired which could negatively impact our operating resultsunder us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our business units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example if one of our business units does not meet its nearterm and longerterm forecasts the goodwill assigned to the business unit could be impaired we may be required to record a charge to earnings in our financial statements during a period in which an impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist which may negatively impact our results of operationsour failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilitieswe are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damageenvironmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory27table of contentsthere is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the conflict zones in and around the democratic republic of congo new us legislation includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals in our products also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stockholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors productsfuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputationwhile we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may declinesection 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer interim chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock   changes in financial

december 15 2000 nvidia and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement or apa to purchase certain graphics chip assets from 3dfx the transaction closed on april 18 2001 that acquisition and 3dfxs october 2002 bankruptcy filing led to four lawsuits against nvidia two brought by 3dfxs former landlords one by 3dfxs bankruptcy trustee and the fourth by a committee of 3dfxs equity security holders in the bankruptcy estate the two landlord cases have been settled with payments from the landlords to nvidia and the equity security holders lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice and no appeal was filed accordingly only the bankruptcy trustee suit remains outstanding as more fully explained below in march 2003 the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court to represent 3dfxs bankruptcy estate served a complaint on nvidia asserting claims for among other things successor liability and fraudulent transfer and seeking additional payments from us the trustees fraudulent transfer theory alleged that nvidia had failed to pay reasonably equivalent value for 3dfxs assets and sought recovery of the difference between the 700 million paid and the alleged fair value which the trustee estimated to exceed 500 million the trustees successor liability theory alleged nvidia was effectively 3dfxs legal successor and therefore was responsible for all of 3dfxs unpaid liabilities on october 13 2005 the bankruptcy court heard the trustees motion for summary adjudication and on december 23 2005 denied that motion in all material respects and held that nvidia may not dispute that the value of the 3dfx transaction was less than 1080 million the bankruptcy court denied the trustees request to find that the value of the 3dfx assets conveyed to nvidia was at least 1080 million 29table of contentsin early november 2005 after several months of mediation nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors or the creditors committee agreed to a plan of liquidation of 3dfx which included a conditional settlement of the trustees claims against us this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately 306 million to the 3dfx estate under the settlement 56 million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees and 250 million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of 3dfx accordingly during the three month period ended october 30 2005 we recorded 56 million as a charge to settlement costs and 250 million as additional purchase price for 3dfx the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation processon december 21 2006 the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustees case against nvidia on january 2 2007 nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committees plan a nonjury trial began on march 21 2007 on valuation issues in the trustees constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia specifically the bankruptcy court tried four questions 1 what did 3dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa 2 of what was transferred what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy courts avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions 3 what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question 2 and 4 was the 700 million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed posttrial briefing on may 25 2007on april 30 2008 the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of 3dfx were not injured by the transaction this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustees action however as the trustees claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending on june 19 2008 nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidias favor on september 11 2008 the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september 22 2008 and on september 25 2008 nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court the district courts hearing on the trustees appeal was held on june 10 2009 on december 20
