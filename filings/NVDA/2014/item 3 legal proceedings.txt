worldwide sales and marketing strategy is key to our objective to become the leading supplier of highperformance and efficient gpus and mobile soc products our sales and marketing teams work closely with each industrys respective original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms system builders motherboard manufacturers addin board manufacturers or aibs and industry trendsetters collectively referred to as our channel to define product features performance price and timing of new products members of our sales team have a high level of technical expertise and product and industry knowledge to support the competitive and complex design win process we also employ a highly skilled team of application engineers to assist our channel in designing testing and qualifying system designs that incorporate our products we believe that the depth and quality of our design support are keys to improving our channels timetomarket maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction within our channel and fostering relationships that encourage customers to use the next generation of our productsin the markets we serve that purchase our gpus the sales process involves achieving key design wins with leading oems and major system builders and supporting the product design into high volume production with key odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs these design wins in turn influence the retail and system builder channel that is serviced by aib and motherboard manufacturers our distribution strategy is to work with a number of leading independent contract equipment manufacturers or cems odms motherboard manufacturers aibs and distributors each of which have relationships with a broad range of major oems andor strong brand name recognition in the retail channel currently we sell a significant portion of our processors directly to distributors cems odms motherboard manufacturers and aibs which then sell boards and systems with our products to leading oems retail outlets and a large number of system builders in the tegra processor segment that we serve the sales process primarily involves achieving key design wins directly with the leading mobile oems and supporting the product design into highvolume production as a result of our channel strategy a small number of our customers represent the majority of our revenue however their end customers consist of a large number of oems and system builders throughout the world sales to our largest customer accounted for 11 of our total revenue for fiscal year 2014 to encourage software title developers and publishers to develop games optimized for platforms utilizing our products and enterprise applications optimized for our gpus we seek to establish and maintain strong relationships in the software development community engineering and marketing personnel interact with and visit key software developers to promote and discuss our products as well as to ascertain product requirements and solve technical problems our developer program makes certain that our products are available to developers prior to volume availability in order to encourage the development of software applications and game titles that are optimized for our products backlog our sales are primarily made pursuant to standard purchase orders the quantity of products purchased by our customers as well as our shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules in light of industry practice and experience we believe that only a small portion of our backlog is noncancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the noncancelable portion is not significant seasonalityour gpu and tegra processor products serve many markets from consumer pc gaming to enterprise workstations to government and service provider cloud datacenters however a majority of our revenue is consumer focused our consumer products have typically seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year however there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 8table of contentsmanufacturing we do not directly manufacture semiconductor wafers used for our products instead we utilize what is known as a fabless manufacturing strategy for all of our productline operating segments whereby we employ worldclass suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process including wafer fabrication assembly testing and packaging this strategy uses the expertise of industryleading suppliers that are certified by the international organization for standardization in such areas as fabrication assembly quality control and assurance reliability and testing in addition this strategy allows us to avoid many of the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating manufacturing operations our suppliers are also responsible for procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our products as a result we can focus our resources on product design additional quality assurance marketing and customer supportwe utilize industryleading suppliers such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited to produce our semiconductor wafers we then utilize independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co ltd and siliconware precision industries company ltd to perform assembly testing and packaging of most of our products we purchase substrates from ibidenco ltd nanya technology corporation and unimicron technology corporationwe typically receive semiconductor products from our subcontractors perform incoming quality assurance and then ship the semiconductors to cems distributors motherboard and aib customers from our thirdparty warehouse in hong kong generally these manufacturers assemble and test the boards based on our design kit and test specifications and then ship our products to retailers system builders or oems as motherboard and addin board solutions inventory and working capital we focus considerable attention on managing our inventories and other workingcapitalrelated items we manage inventories by communicating with our customers and then using our industry experience to forecast demand on a productbyproduct basis we then place manufacturing orders for our products that are based on forecasted demand the quantity of products actually purchased by our customers as well as shipment schedules are subject to revisions that reflect changes in both the customers requirements and in manufacturing availability we generally maintain substantial inventories of our products because the semiconductor industry is characterized by short lead time orders and quick delivery schedules a substantial amount of our inventories are maintained as semifinished products that can be leveraged across a wide range of our processors to balance our customer demands  our existing cash and marketable securities balances increased by 253 to 467 billion at the end of fiscal year 2014 compared with the end of fiscal year 2013 primarily due to our issuance of 15 billion in convertible senior notes in december 2013 we believe that these balances and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating acquisition capital purchases and our intended capital return to shareholders needs for at least the next twelve monthsresearch and development we believe that the continued introduction of new and enhanced products designed to deliver leading visual computing technology including 3d graphics hd video audio ultralow power consumption and soc architectures is essential to our future success our research and development strategy is to focus on concurrently developing multiple generations of gpus and tegra processors including gpus for highperformance computing and tegra socs for shield and other mobile products using independent design teams our research and development efforts are performed within specialized groups consisting of software engineering hardware engineering very large scale integration design engineering process engineering architecture and algorithms these groups act as a pipeline designed to allow the efficient simultaneous development of multiple generations of products a critical component of our product development effort is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry we invest significant resources in the development of relationships with industry leaders often assisting these companies in the product definition of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics market and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis we believe this approach assists us in meeting the new design schedules of pc oems and other manufacturers we believe in leveraging our significant rampd depth and scale to create differentiated products as of january 26 2014 we had 6384 fulltime employees engaged in research and development during fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 we incurred research and development expense of 13358 million 11473 million and 10026 million respectively 9table of contentscompetition  the market for our products is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance breadth of product offerings access to customers and distribution channels software support conformity to industry standard application programming interfaces manufacturing capabilities processor pricing and total system costs we believe that our ability to remain competitive will depend on how well we are able to anticipate the features and functions that customers will demand and whether we are able to deliver consistent volumes of our products at acceptable levels of quality and at competitive prices we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market sharea significant source of competition comes from companies that provide or intend to provide gpus and mobile soc products some of our competitors may have greater marketing financial distribution and manufacturing resources than we do and may be more able to adapt to customer or technological changes our current competitors includesuppliers of discrete and integrated gpus including supercomputers and chipsets that incorporate 3d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions such as advanced micro devices or amd and intel corporationsuppliers of soc products that support tablets smartphones and pcs as well as products that are embedded into smart devices such as televisions monitors settop boxes gaming devices and automobiles such as amd arm holdings plc or arm broadcom corporation freescale semiconductor inc hisilicon technologies co ltd imagination technologies ltd intel marvell technology group ltd mediatek

technologies group plc andsuppliers of cellular basebands such as broadcom corporation hisilicon technologies co ltd intel marvell technology group ltd mediatek qualcomm incorporated samsung electronics co ltd and spreadtrum communications co ltdif and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intels and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds accelerated processing unit or apu products as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted patents and proprietary rights we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally our currently issued patents have expiration dates from april 2014 to september 2033 we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countriesthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions andthe commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and

evaluating nvidia and our business the following factors should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form 10k before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including but not limited to the risks described below additionally any one of the following risks could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations which could cause our stock price to decline additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operationsrisks related to our business industry and partnersif we are unable to compete in the markets for our products our financial results will be adversely impactedthe market for our products is extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify as current competitors expand their product offerings industry standards continue to evolve and others realize the market potential of mobile and consumer products and services we expect competition to increase from both existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than ours or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products in addition it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and acquire significant market share furthermore competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us or they may offer additional products services or other incentives that we may not be able to match in addition many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories greater name recognition larger customer bases and greater sales marketing and distribution resources than we do in order to effectively compete we may have to invest more resources in research and development than anticipated which could increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results if we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development efforts without a corresponding increase in revenue our operating results could decline in order to remain competitive and meet the demands of the markets we serve we expect to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development our ability to compete will depend on among other factors our ability tocontinue to keep pace with technological developmentsdevelop and introduce new products services technologies and enhancements on a timely basistransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometriesobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materials andsucceed in significant foreign markets such as china and indiaif we are unable to compete in our current or new markets demand for our products could decrease which could cause our revenue to decline and our financial results to suffer if and to the extent we offer products in new markets we may face competition from existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete we expect substantial competition from both intel and amds strategy of selling platform solutions including integrating a cpu and a gpu on the same chip or same package as evidenced by intels cpus with integrated graphics and amds apu product as amd and intel continue to pursue platform solutions and integrated cpus we may not be able to successfully compete and our business could be negatively impacted despite the use of these integrated cpus personal computer or pc builders and consumers have continued to embrace discrete gpus to provide higher performance if integrated cpus offer a more compelling value proposition in the future pc builders and consumers may move away from the use of discrete gpus which could adversely affect our business and cause our financial results to declinewe are implementing a business strategy to license our gpu cores and visual computing patent portfolio to device manufacturers although we have engaged in licensing in the past we are now engaging a broader market with new and existing competitors who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirements and emerging technologies we cannot be assured of the extent of the demand for licenses to our gpu cores or other elements of our visual computing patent portfolio or that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors who may have stronger positions in these new markets 13table of contentsour business results could be adversely affected if the identification and development of new products is delayed or unsuccessfulin order to maintain or improve our financial results we will need to continue to identify and develop new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and costeffective manner the process of developing new products and services and enhancing existing products and services is highly complex costly and uncertain and any failure by us to anticipate customers changing needs and emerging technology trends could adversely affect our business we must make multiyear investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our new products and technologies it is possible that our development efforts will not be successful and that our new technologies will not result in meaningful revenues even if we introduce new and enhanced products to the market we may not be able to achieve consumer andor market acceptance of them in a timely mannerour ability to successfully develop and deliver new products will depend on various factors including our ability toeffectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new marketstimely complete and introduce new products and technologiestransition our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries andobtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging materialswe occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements and we could experience delays in the future in addition in the past we have faced challenges in managing product transitions from older to newer products resulting in obsolete inventory our failure to successfully develop and introduce new products and technologies or identify new uses for existing or future products could result in rapidly declining average selling prices reduced demand for our products or loss of market share any of which could harm our competitive position and cause our revenue gross margin and overall financial results to sufferif we are unable to achieve consumer and market acceptance and design wins for our products and technologies our results of operations and competitive position will be harmedthe success of our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to achieve consumer and market acceptance of our new products and enhancements to our existing products and identify and enter new markets such as cloudbased computing appliances servers automotive technology smartphones tablets video game consoles and other similar consumer electronic devices the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results changes in pricing of dynamic randomaccess memory devices and other changes in the total system cost of addin boards or aibs as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions broad consumer and market acceptance is difficult to achieve and such consumer and market acceptance if achieved is difficult to sustain due to intense competition and frequent new technology and product introductions our success in achieving consumer and market acceptance will depend in part on our ability to cultivate new industry relationships and improve the functionality of our products as the number of internetconnected devices increases if we do not successfully achieve or maintain consumer and market acceptance for our products and enhancements or identify and enter new markets our ability to compete and maintain or increase revenues will sufferwe believe achieving design wins which entails having our existing and future products chosen for hardware components or subassemblies designed by original equipment manufacturers or oems original design manufacturers or odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers is an integral part of our future success our oem odm and aib and motherboard manufacturers customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year typically based on spring and fall design cycles or in connection with trade shows accordingly when our customers are making their design decisions our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products in order to be included in our customers new system configurations this requires that weanticipate the features and functionality that customers and consumers will demandincorporate those features and functionalities into products that meet the exacting design requirements of our customers14table of contentsprice our products competitively andintroduce products to the market within our customers limited design cyclesif oems odms and aib and motherboard manufacturers do not include our products in their systems they will typically not use our products in their systems until at least the next design configuration our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and be compliant with evolving industry standards unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards we may not be designed into our customers product designs however to be compliant with changes to industry standards we may have to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products which could negatively impact our gross margin or operating results if we are unable to achieve new design wins for existing or new customers we may lose market share and our operating results would be negatively impactedwe depend on foundries to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies or otherwise satisfy our manufacturing requirements which would harm our businesswe do not manufacture the silicon wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industryleading foundries such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited or tsmc to manufacture our semiconductor wafers using their fabrication equipment and techniques a substantial portion of our wafers are supplied by tsmc the foundries which have limited capacity also manufacture products for other semiconductor companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm commitment contracts with any of these foundries they do not have an obligation to provide us with any set pricing or minimum quantity of product at any time except as may be provided in a specific purchase order most of our products are only manufactured by one foundry at a time in times of high demand the foundries could choose to prioritize their capacity for other companies reduce or eliminate deliveries to us or increase the prices that they charge us if we are unable to meet customer demand due to reduced or eliminated deliveries or have to increase the prices of our products we could lose sales to customers which would negatively impact our revenue and our reputation furthermore our thirdparty foundries may not be able to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leadingedge process technologies including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies needed to manufacture our products profitably or on a timely basis if our thirdparty foundries experience manufacturing inefficiencies we may fail to achieve acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays for example due to capacity constraints at tsmc of our 28 nanometer kepler gpus in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 we were unable to fulfill customer demand for our highend desktop gpu products and as our sales mix shifted to our mainstream desktop gpu products revenue and gross margins for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013 were negatively impacted compared to the prior quarterbecause the leadtime needed to establish strategic relationships with new manufacturing partners and achieve initial production could be over a year we do not have a readily available alternative source of supply for our products in addition the time and effort to qualify a new foundry would result in additional expense and diversion of resources and could result in lost sales any of which would negatively impact our financial results we believe that longterm market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with the thirdparty manufacturers we use to ensure adequate product supply and competitive pricing to respond to customer demand failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results and damage our reputationmanufacturing yields for our products are a function of product design which is developed largely by us and process technology which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer low yields may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know a yield problem exists until our design is manufactured when a yield issue is identified the product is analyzed and tested to determine the cause as a result yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process resolution of yield problems requires cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer because of our potentially limited access to wafer foundry capacity decreases in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers lower than expected yields could potentially harm customer relationships our reputation and our financial results   15table of contentsa decline in demand in certain enduser markets could decrease the demand for our products and harm our results of operations our customer base includes companies in a wide range of enduser markets but we generate a significant amount of revenue from sales to consumers of communications and pcrelated products within these enduser markets a large portion of our revenue is generated from sales to consumers in the smartphone tablet and pc markets including professional workstations decline in one or several of these enduser markets could harm demand for our products and our results of operations and financial condition these declines could be large and sudden because smartphone tablet and pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions in these cases these manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed which would have a negative impact on our financial resultswe sell our products to a limited number of customers and our business could suffer if we lose any of these customerswe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers revenue from significant customers those representing 10 or more of total revenue was approximately 21 of our total revenue from two customers in fiscal year 2014 and approximately 13 and 11 of our total revenue from one customer in fiscal years 2013 and 2012 respectively approximately 23 of our accounts receivable balance was from one customer as of january 26 2014 and approximately 40 of our accounts receivable balance was from three customers as of january 27 2013 we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to certain customers in the future we may have to record additional reserves or writeoffs andor defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results and as a result of the tightening of the credit markets we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customers or in amounts that we deem sufficient revenue from our largest customer has fluctuated significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with each customer as well as the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets and will likely continue to fluctuate dramatically in the future our operating results in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products in the future these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all purchase fewer products than they did in the past or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way particularly becausesubstantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis which permits our customers to cancel change or delay product purchase commitments with little or no notice to us and without penaltyour customers may develop their own solutionsour customers may purchase products from our competitors orour customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our productsthe loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations and any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could harm our operating results and financial condition16table of contentsif we fail to appropriately scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers our business and profitability could be harmedto achieve our business objectives it may be necessary from time to time for us to expand or contract our operations in the future we may not be able to scale our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers in that event we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected conversely if we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of increased demand for our products and such demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expected the rate of increase in our costs and operating expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue which would adversely affect our results of operations in addition if such demand does not materialize at the pace which we expect we may be required to scale down our business through expense and headcount reductions as well as facility consolidations or closures that could result in restructuring charges that would materially and adversely affect our results of operations because many of our expenses are fixed in the shortterm or are incurred in advance of anticipated sales we may not be able to decrease our expenses in a timely manner to offset any decrease in customer demand if customer demand does not increase as anticipated our profitability could be adversely affected due to our higher expense levelsour past growth has placed and any future longterm growth is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management personnel systems and resources to implement our current business and product plans we will need to continue to expand train manage and motivate our workforce all of these endeavors require substantial management effort if we are unable to effectively manage our expanding operations we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities or conversely we may scale our business too quickly and the rate of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue either of which would harm our results of operationsour revenue may fluctuate while a majority of our operating expenses are a factor of multiyear investments ahead of when revenue is received which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations our operating expenses are primarily related to multiyear research and development investments ahead of the revenue received from the products which are produced our research and development expenses totaled 134 billion 115 billion and 100 billion in fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectivelyany one or more of the risks discussed in this annual report on form 10k or other factors could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income accordingly we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance similarly the results of any quarterly or full fiscal year period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a subsequent quarter or a full fiscal year as a result it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations may continue to be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue gross profit and results of operationsbecause our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors our failure to forecast changes in any of these factors could adversely affect our gross marginwe are focused on improving our gross margin our gross margin for any period depends on a number of factors including the mix of our products soldaverage selling pricesintroduction of new productsproduct transitionssales discountsunexpected pricing actions by our competitors17table of contentsthe cost of product components andthe yield of wafers produced by the foundries that manufacture our productsif we do not correctly forecast the impact of any of the relevant factors on our business there may not be any actions we can take or we may not be able to take any possible actions in time to counteract any negative impact on our gross margin in addition if we are unable to meet our gross margin target for any period or the target set by analysts the trading price of our common stock may decline our failure to estimate customer demand properly could adversely affect our financial resultswe manufacture our products based on forecasts of customer demand in order to have shorter shipment lead times and quicker delivery schedules for our customers as a result we may build inventories for anticipated periods of growth which do not occur or may build inventory anticipating demand for a product that does not materialize in forecasting demand we make multiple assumptions any of which may prove to be incorrect situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory includechanges in business and economic conditions including downturns in the semiconductor industry andor overall economychanges in consumer confidence caused by changes in market conditions including changes in the credit market expectations for inflation and energy pricesif there were a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our productsif there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirementsif we fail to estimate customer demand properly for our older products as our newer products are introduced orif our competition were to take unexpected competitive pricing actionsany inability to sell products to which we have devoted resources could harm our business in addition cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin and restrict our ability to fund operations additionally because we often sell a substantial portion of our products in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitments in a timely manner in response to customer cancellations or deferrals we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding inventory writedowns andor a reduction in average selling prices if growth slows or does not materialize or if we incorrectly forecast product demand which could negatively impact our financial resultsconversely if we underestimate our customers demand for our products our thirdparty manufacturing partners may not have adequate leadtime or capacity to increase production for us meaning that we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill our customers orders on a timely basis even if we are able to increase production levels to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in a cost effective or timely manner inability to fulfill our customers orders on a timely basis or at all could damage our customer relationships result in lost revenue cause a loss in market share impact our customer relationships or damage our reputation any of which could adversely impact our business18table of contentswe may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments and we may not be able to

products services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products and business we may enter into future acquisitions of or investments in businesses in order to complement or expand our current businesses or enter into a new business market negotiations associated with an acquisition or strategic investment could divert managements attention and other company

impact our operating resultsunder generally accepted accounting principles in the united states or us gaap we review our amortizable intangible assets and goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable assets from acquisitions may not be recoverable due to factors such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry or in any of our reporting units estimates of future cash flows are based on an updated longterm financial outlook of our operations however actual performance in the nearterm or longterm could be materially different from these forecasts which could impact future estimates for example in the most recent impairment test of our tegra processor reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit only exceeded its carrying value by 17 if the future operating results of the tegra processor reporting unit are significantly lower than our estimates the goodwill assigned to tegra processor could be impaired which would negatively impact our results of operationssystem security risks data protection breaches cyberattacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue increase our expenses damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties create system disruptions or cause shutdowns computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses worms and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products the costs to us to eliminate or alleviate malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions delays cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales manufacturing distribution or other critical functions we manage and store various proprietary information

other forms of deception could expose us our partners and customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information result in litigation and potential liability for us damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business in addition the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant for example in july 2012 unauthorized third parties gained access to certain user information on our online forums we have strengthened security in an effort to minimize future attacks however hackers may continue to target our security controls in the future and we cannot guarantee that our security measures will be able to prevent future breaches of our website andor attacks on our productsportions of our it infrastructure also may experience interruptions of service or produce errors in connection with systemic failures systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time we may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive time consuming disruptive and resourceintensive such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes delayed sales lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results stock price and reputation we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees which could negatively impact our businessour future success and ability to compete are substantially dependent on our ability to identify hire train and retain highly qualified key personnel the market for key employees in the technology industry can be competitive none of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement meaning our relationships with all of our key employees are at will the loss of the services of any of our key employees could delay our product development efforts harm our ability to sell our products or otherwise negatively impact our business20table of contentswe are dependent on third parties for assembly testing and packaging of our products which reduces our control over our product delivery schedule product quantity or product qualityour products are assembled tested and packaged by independent subcontractors such as advanced semiconductor engineering inc chippac jsi logistics ltd king yuan electronics co and siliconware precision industries co ltd as a result we do not directly control our product delivery schedules product quantity or product quality all of these subcontractors assemble test and package products for other companies including some of our competitors because we do not have longterm agreements with our subcontractors when demand for subcontractors to assemble test or package products is high our subcontractors may decide to prioritize the orders of other customers over our orders because the time required to qualify a different subcontractor to assemble test or package our products can be lengthy if we have to find a replacement subcontractor we could experience significant delays in shipments of our products product shortages a decrease in the quality of our products or an increase in product cost any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture assembly or testing of our products which could cause our gross margin to decline we rely on thirdparty vendors to supply software development tools to us for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop or enhance new or existing productswe rely on thirdparty software development tools to assist us in the design simulation and verification of new products or product enhancements to bring new products or product enhancements to market in a timely manner or at all we need software development tools that are sophisticated enough or technologically advanced enough to complete our design simulations and verifications in the past we have experienced delays in the introduction of products as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products in the future the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from our products may exceed the capabilities of available software development tools unavailability of software development tools may result in our missing design cycles or losing design wins either of which could result in a loss of market share or negatively impact our operating resultsbecause of the importance of software development tools to the development and enhancement of our products a critical component of our product development efforts is our partnerships with leaders in the computeraided design industry including cadence design systems inc and synopsys inc we have invested significant resources to develop relationships with these industry leaders and have often assisted them in the development of their new products we believe that forming these relationships and utilizing nextgeneration development tools to design simulate and verify our products will help us remain at the forefront of the 3d graphics communications and networking segments and develop products that utilize leadingedge technology on a rapid basis if these relationships are not successful we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in a timely manner which could result in a loss of market share a decrease in revenue or a negative impact on our operating results if our products contain significant defects our financial results could be negatively impacted our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market shareour products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design fabrication packaging materials andor use within a system if any of our products or technologies contains a defect compatibility issue or other error we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue such efforts could divert our engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin in addition an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins also we may be required to reimburse customers including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive could damage our reputation could result in the shifting of business to our competitors and could result in litigation against us costs associated with correcting defects errors bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results     21table of contentsour business is cyclical in nature and has experienced severe downturns that have harmed and may in the future harm our business and financial resultsour business is directly affected by market conditions in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry the semiconductor industry has been adversely affected by many factors including the global downturn that started in the second half of 2008 ongoing efforts by our customers to reduce their spending diminished product demand increased inventory levels lower average selling prices uncertainty regarding longterm growth rates and underlying financial health and increased competition these factors could among other things limit our ability to maintain or increase our sales or recognize revenue and in turn adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition if our actions to reduce our operating expenses to sufficiently offset these factors when they occur are unsuccessful our operating results will sufferwe are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our businesswe conduct our business worldwide and we have offices in various countries outside of the united states our semiconductor wafers are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the united states and other americas we generated 75 74 and 78 of our revenue for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas the manufacture assembly test and packaging of our products outside of the united states operation of offices outside of the united states and sales to customers internationally subjects us to a number of risks includinginternational economic and political conditions such as political tensions between countries in which we do businessunexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements complying with a variety of foreign lawsdiffering legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practiceslocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices

terrorism cyber attack civil unrest war and diseasesif sales to any of our customers outside of the united states and other americas are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors our revenue may be negatively impacted our international operations are subject to many of the above listed risks difficulties with our international operations including finding appropriate staffing and office space may divert managements attention and other resources any of which could negatively impact our operating results22table of contentslegal and regulatory requirements differ among jurisdictions worldwide violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines criminal sanctions against us our officers or our employees prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation although we have policies controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with foreign laws many of these laws and regulations are ambiguous and are often interpreted and enforced in unpredictable waysthe economic conditions in our primary overseas markets particularly in asia may negatively impact the demand for our products abroad all of our international sales to date have been denominated in united states dollars accordingly an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets or require us to assume the risk of denominating certain sales in foreign currencies we anticipate that these factors will impact our business to a greater degree as we further expand our international business activitiesbusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes telecommunications failures power or water shortages tsunamis floods hurricanes typhoons fires extreme weather conditions medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters catastrophic events or climate change the occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses seriously harm our revenue and financial condition adversely affect our competitive position increase our costs and expenses and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development activities are located in california and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in asia near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity in addition a majority of our principal it data centers are located in california making our operations vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in this geographical area the manufacture of product components the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations including taiwan china and korea our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason including natural disasters high heat events or water

has at times experienced substantial price volatility and as a result investors may suffer lossesour stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility as a result of variations between our actual and anticipated financial results announcements by us and our competitors or uncertainty about current global economic conditions the stock market as a whole also has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies operating performance23table of contentsin the past securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities due to changes in the volatility of our stock price we have been in the past and may be in the future the target of securities litigation such lawsuits generally result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business in addition the costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial results we are subject to litigation which if determined adversely to us could harm our business we are engaged in litigation with parties related to our acquisition of 3dfx in 2001 in addition in september october and november 2008 several putative securities class action lawsuits were filed against us for alleged defects in our previous generation mcp and gpu products please refer to note 12 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for further details on these lawsuitsthere can be no assurance that any litigation to which we are a party will be resolved in our favor any claim that is successfully decided against us may cause us to pay substantial damages including punitive damages and other related fees or prevent us from selling or importing certain of our products regardless of whether lawsuits are resolved in our favor or if we are the plaintiff or the defendant in the litigation any lawsuits to which we are a party will likely be expensive and time consuming to defend or resolve such lawsuits could result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business such lawsuits could also harm our relationships with existing customers and result in the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations which could harm our business costs of defense and any damages resulting from litigation a ruling against us or a settlement of the litigation could adversely affect our cash flow and financial resultsactions to adequately protect our intellectual property rights such as litigation to defend against alleged infringement of intellectual property rights or to enforce our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs to us and our ability to compete could be harmed if we fail to take such actions or are unsuccessful in doing sowe rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks trade secrets employee and thirdparty nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property in the united states and internationally we have numerous patents issued allowed and pending in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our products and the technology used in connection with our products we also rely on international treaties organizations and foreign laws to protect our intellectual property the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold including various countries in asia may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely we continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as the commercial significance of our operations and our competitors operations in particular countries and regionsthe location in which our products are manufacturedour strategic technology or product directions in different countries andthe degree to which intellectual property laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictionsour pending patent applications and any future applications may not be approved in addition any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged invalidated infringed circumvented or misappropriated by third parties we expect that as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases and as competition intensifies the volume of intellectual property infringement claims and lawsuits may increase we may in the future become involved in lawsuits or other legal proceedings alleging patent infringement or other intellectual property rights violations by us or parties that we have agreed to indemnify for certain claims of infringement third parties may also claim that our employees have misappropriated or divulged their former employers trade secrets or confidential informationan unfavorable ruling in any such intellectual property related litigation could include significant damages invalidation of a patent or family of patents indemnification of customers payment of lost profits or when it has been sought injunctive relief24table of contentsin addition in the future we may need to commence litigation or other legal proceedings in order to assert claims of infringement of our intellectual propertyenforce our patentsprotect our trade secrets or knowhow ordetermine the enforceability scope and validity of the propriety rights of othersif we have to initiate litigation in order to protect our intellectual property our operating expenses may increase which could negatively impact our operating results our failure to effectively protect our intellectual property could harm our businessif infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a third parties patent or intellectual property we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third parties patent or other intellectual property rights however we may not be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms acceptable to us particularly from our competitors if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology that we use or that is used in one of our products we could be subject to substantial liabilities or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products we may also have to make royalty or other payments or cross license our technology if these arrangements are not concluded on commercially reasonable terms our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of a customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expenses which could negatively impact our operating results changes in united states tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could adversely impact our business currently a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the united states and a significant portion of our assets including employees are located outside the united states united states income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for certain nonunited states subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries throughout the period of president obamas administration the white house has proposed various international tax measures some of which if enacted into law would substantially reduce our ability to defer united

cost of us multinational corporations to increase if these or similar proposals are constituted into legislation in the current or future years they could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations our operating results may be adversely affected if we are subject to unexpected tax liabilities we are subject to taxation by a number of taxing authorities both in the united states and throughout the world tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for our income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable any of the below could cause our effective tax rate to be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accrualsthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxedadjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returnschanges in available tax creditschanges in stockbased compensation expensechanges in tax laws the interpretation of tax laws either in the united states or

earthquakes floods and or other natural disastersexpensing employee equity compensation adversely affects our operating results and could also adversely affect our competitive positionsince inception we have used equity through our equity incentive plans and our employee stock purchase program as a fundamental component of our compensation packages we believe that these programs directly motivate our employees and through the use of vesting encourage our employees to remain with us we record compensation expense for stock options restricted stock units and our employee stock purchase plan using the fair value of those awards in accordance with us gaap stockbased compensation expense was 1363 million 1367 million and 1364 million for fiscal years 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively related to ongoing vesting of equity awards which negatively impacted our operating results to the extent that expensing employee equity compensation makes it more expensive to grant stock options and restricted stock units or to continue to have an employee stock purchase program we may decide to incur increased cash compensation costs in addition actions that we may take to reduce stockbased compensation expense that may be more severe than any actions our competitors may implement and may make it difficult to attract retain and motivate employees which could adversely affect our competitive position as well as our business and operating results   26table of contentswe have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligations       in december 2013 we issued 15 billion of 100 convertible senior notes due 2018 or 100 notes our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligationsplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors andincrease our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditionsthe exercise of warrants issued to goldman sachs amp co or goldman concurrently with our 100 notes would and the conversion of our 100 notes could dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholdersthe warrants issued concurrently with our 100 notes shall be deemed to be automatically exercised on certain dates between march 2019 and june 2019 unless goldman notifies us otherwise any issuance by us of additional shares to goldman upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders moreover the conversion of our 100 notes may dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and could have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price of the 100 notes any sales in the public market by goldman of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants or sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the 100 notes could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stockour failure to comply with any applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines suspension of production excess inventory sales limitations and criminal and civil liabilitieswe are subject to various state federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment including restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making producers of those products financially responsible for the collection treatment recycling and disposal of those products although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in complete compliance with such laws and regulations if we violate or fail to comply with any of them a range of consequences could result including fines importexport restrictions sales limitations criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of exposure to hazardous materials used stored released disposed of by us or located at under or emanating from our facilities or other environmental or natural resource damageenvironmental laws are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union and china are two among a growing number of jurisdictions that have enacted in recent years restrictions on the use of lead among other chemicals in electronic products these regulations affect semiconductor packaging there is a risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yields of leadfree products may be less favorable compared to leadbased products or that the transition to leadfree products may produce sudden changes in demand which may result in excess inventory27table of contentsthere is also a movement to improve the transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals coming from the areas of conflict recent us legislation includes sec disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries for which the first report is due on may 31 2014 for the 2013 calendar year the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices as a result there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflictfree metals and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices furthermore we may incur additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals in our products also because our supply chain is complex we may be unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in our products resulting in reputational challenges with our customers and stockholders some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflictfree if we cannot satisfy these customers they may choose a competitors products although we expect to be able to file the required report on time we are dependent upon the information provided by our many suppliers to the extent that the information we receive from our suppliers is inaccurate or inadequate or our processes in obtaining such information do not fulfill the secs diligence requirements we could also face sec enforcement risksfuture environmental legal requirements may become more stringent or costly and our compliance costs and potential liabilities arising from past and future releases of or exposure to hazardous substances may harm our business and our reputationwhile we believe that we have adequate internal control over financial reporting if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines that we do not our reputation may be adversely affected and our stock price may declinesection 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 requires our management to report on and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting we have an ongoing program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements however the manner in which companies and their independent public accounting firms apply these requirements and test companies internal controls remains subject to some judgment to date we have incurred and we expect to continue to incur increased expense and to devote additional management resources to section 404 compliance despite our efforts if we identify a material weakness in our internal controls there can be no assurance that we will be able to remediate that material weakness in a timely manner or that we will be able to maintain all of the controls necessary to determine that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the event that our chief executive officer our chief financial officer or our independent registered public accounting firm determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as defined under section 404 investor perceptions of us may be adversely affected and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock   changes in financial accounting standards or interpretations of existing standards could affect our reported results of operationswe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap these principles are constantly subject to review and interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles a change in these principles or the interpretation of them can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions additionally changes in existing accounting rules such as the possible upcoming changes to revenue recognition and lease accounting standards or changes in practices such as changes to auditing standards promulgated by the public company accounting oversight board could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our businessdelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft corporation could delay or prevent a change in control our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock these provisions include the followingthe ability of our board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approvalthe prohibition of stockholder action by written consent28table of contentsa classified board of directors which will become fully declassified from and after our 2014 annual meeting of stockholders advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposalsthe ability of our

individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than 30 of the outstanding shares of our common stock microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock the microsoft provision and the other factors listed above could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desireitem 1b unresolved staff comments not applicable item 2 propertiesour
