substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts kv in locations throughout centerpoint houstons certificated service territory centerpoint houston constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commission 1electric distribution in the electric reliability council of texas inc ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer centerpoint houstons distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders centerpoint houstons operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations centerpoint houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission texas utility commission rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the texas utility commission ercot market framework centerpoint houston is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as centerpoint houston are regulated by the texas utility commission ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 85 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of approximately 74000 megawatts mw at december 31 2012 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc these reliability standards are administered by the texas regional entity tre a functionally independent division of ercot the texas utility commission has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot independent system operator ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers unlike certain other regional power markets the ercot market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the ercot iso does not procure energy on behalf of its members other than to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system members who sell and purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and purchases of power bilaterally the ercot iso also serves as agent for procuring ancillary services for those members who elect not to provide their own ancillary services centerpoint houstons electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area centerpoint houston participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid resolution of trueup appeal in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law that led to the restructuring of certain integrated electric utilities operating within texas pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a trueup mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the texas utility commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge ctc as a rider to the utilitys tariffcenterpoint houstons integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties in march 2004 centerpoint houston filed a trueup application with the texas utility commission requesting recovery of associated costs of 37 billion excluding interest as allowed under the texas electric restructuring law in december 2004 the texas utility commission issued its final order trueup order allowing centerpoint 2houston to recover a trueup balance of approximately 23 billion which included interest through august 31 2004 and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery along with the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after august 31 2004 and certain other adjustments to reflect the impact of the trueup order in 2004 and 2005 centerpoint energy recorded a net aftertax extraordinary loss of 947 million various parties including centerpoint houston appealed the trueup order these appeals were heard first by a district court in travis county texas then by the texas third court of appeals and finally by the texas supreme court in march 2011 the texas supreme court issued a unanimous ruling on such appeals in which it affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the texas utility commission in june 2011 the texas supreme court issued a final mandate remanding the case to the texas utility commission for further proceedings the remand proceeding  in september 2011 centerpoint houston reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the texas utility commission and certain intervenors to settle the issues in the remand proceeding the settlement in october 2011 the texas utility commission approved a final order the final order in the remand proceeding consistent with the settlement the final order provided that i centerpoint houston was entitled to recover an additional trueup balance of 1695 billion the recoverable trueup balance in the remand proceeding ii no further interest would accrue on the recoverable trueup balance and iii centerpoint houston would reimburse certain parties for their reasonable rate case expenses  in october 2011 the texas utility commission also issued a financing order the financing order that authorized the issuance of transition bonds by centerpoint houston to securitize the recoverable trueup balance in january 2012 centerpoint energy transition bond company iv llc bond company iv a new special purpose subsidiary of centerpoint houston issued 1695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 09012 to 30282 and final maturity dates ranging from april 15 2018 to october 15 2025 through the issuance of these transition bonds centerpoint houston recovered the recoverable trueup balance less approximately 104 million of offering

million aftertax will be recorded as an equity return over the life of the transition bonds customers centerpoint houston serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2012 centerpoint houstons customers consisted of approximately 75 reps which sell electricity to over two million metered customers in centerpoint houstons certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside centerpoint houstons certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the texas utility commission sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg energy inc nrg represented approximately 38 36 and 39 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings corp energy future holdings represented approximately 12 11 and 10 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2012 was 158 million approximately 42 and 2 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively centerpoint houston does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid in december 2008 centerpoint houston received approval from the texas utility commission to deploy an advanced metering system ams across its service territory during the following five years centerpoint houston began installing advanced meters in march 2009 in may 2012 centerpoint houston substantially completed the deployment of the advanced metering system having installed approximately 22 million smart meters this technology should encourage greater energy conservation by giving houstonarea electric consumers the ability to better monitor and manage their electric use and its cost in near real time to recover the cost of the ams the texas utility commission approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years for the first 24 months which began in february 2009 the surcharge for residential customers was 324 per month beginning in february 2011 the surcharge was reduced to 305 per month in september 2011 the surcharge duration was reduced from 12 years to approximately six years for residential customers and approximately eight years for commercial customers the surcharge 3amounts or duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  centerpoint houston is also pursuing deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy that involves the implementation of an intelligent grid ig which would provide ondemand data and information about the status of facilities on its system although this technology is still in the developmental stage centerpoint houston believes it has the potential to provide an improvement in grid planning operations maintenance and customer service for the centerpoint houston distribution system these improvements are expected to result in fewer and shorter outages better customer service improved operations costs improved security and more effective use of our workforce we expect to include the costs of the deployment in future rate proceedings before the texas utility commission in october 2009 the us department of energy doe selected centerpoint houston for a 200 million grant to help fund its ams and ig projects as of december 31 2011 centerpoint houston had received substantially all of the 200 million of grant funding from the doe centerpoint houston used 150 million of the grant funding to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012 instead of 2014 as originally scheduled centerpoint houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately 660 million for the installation of the advanced meters and corresponding communication and data management systems were incurred over the advanced meter deployment period centerpoint houston is using the other 50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig which covers approximately 12 of its service territory this initial deployment is expected to be completed in 2014 it is expected that the capital portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe will cost approximately 140 million competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in centerpoint houstons service area in order for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in centerpoint houstons territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the texas utility commission and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in centerpoint houstons service area at this time distributed generation could result in a reduction of demand for centerpoint houstons electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months properties all of centerpoint houstons properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands

natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal in 2012 approximately 66 of the total throughput of gas operations business occurred in the first and fourth quarters these patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during those periods supply and transportation in 2012 gas operations purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years major suppliers in 2012 included bp energy companybp canada 5energy marketing 122 of supply volumes tenaska

prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion generally the regulations of the states in which gas operations operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually the changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies gas operations uses various thirdparty storage

provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors gas operations has entered into various asset management agreements associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally these asset management agreements are contracts between gas operations and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements gas operations agreed to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for gas operations and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for gas operations gas operations is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization gas operations has received approval from the state regulatory commissions in arkansas louisiana mississippi and oklahoma to retain a share of the asset management agreement proceeds the agreements have varying terms the longest of which expires in 2016 assets as of december 31 2012 gas operations owned approximately 72000 linear miles of natural gas

incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand system capacity in may 2012 cefs purchased the amoruso gathering system located in east texas and related assets from a subsidiary of encana for approximately 89 million in connection with this acquisition cefs entered into a 15year gathering agreement with encana to gather and treat its natural gas production from the amoruso and hilltop fields located in robertson and leon counties in east texas the gathering agreement includes volume commitments and an acreage dedication as of the end of 2012 the amoruso gathering system had nearly 200 mmcf per day of natural gas throughput primarily from the deep bossier and cotton valley lime formations waskom gas processing company prior to july 31 2012 centerpoint energy gas processing company a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of cerc owned a 50 general partnership interest in waskom gas processing company waskom a texas general partnership which owns and operates a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets in east texas on july 31 2012 centerpoint energy purchased the 50 interest that it did not already own in waskom as well as other gathering and related assets from a thirdparty for approximately 273 million the waskom plant is capable of processing approximately 320 mmcf per day of natural gas the gathering assets owned by waskom are capable of gathering approximately 75 mmcf per day of natural gas  assets cercs field services business owns and operates approximately 4600 miles of gathering lines and processing plants that collect treat and process natural gas primarily from three regions located in major producing fields in arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas competition cercs field services business competes with other companies in the natural gas gathering treating and processing business the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and reliability of services cercs field services business competes indirectly with alternative forms of energy including electricity coal and fuel oils the primary competitive factor is price but environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider other forms of energy changes in the availability of energy and pipeline capacity the level of business activity conservation and governmental regulations the capability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors including weather affect the demand for natural gas in areas we serve and the level of competition for gathering treating and processing services in addition competition among forms of energy is affected by commodity pricing levels and influences the level of drilling activity and demand for our gathering operations9other operationsour other

december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 2006 act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act these programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration under the 2002 act remediation activities are to be performed over a 10year period our pipeline subsidiaries met this initial time frame for completion of the base line assessments and are currently performing reassessments as requiredpursuant to the 2006 act the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa at the department of transportation dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our pipeline subsidiaries met this deadline pursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 201111in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirementswe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs interstate and intrastate pipelines and natural gas distribution companies and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 act by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties if we fail to comply with pipeline regulationsenvironmental mattersour operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems gas gathering and processing systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businessesin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time toconstruct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate 12future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonablebased on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you however that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of all material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changein recent years there has been increasing public debate regarding the potential impact on global climate change by various greenhouse gases ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane the principal component of the natural gas that we transport and deliver to customers the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues such as the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in 2012 following a finding by the us environmental protection agency epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning january 2 2011 the other regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january 2 2011 also the epa adopted its mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule that requires the annual calculation and reporting of ghg emissions from natural gas transmission gathering processing and distribution systems and electric distribution systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year these additional reporting requirements began in 2012 and we are currently in compliance these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa although the adoption of new legislation is uncertain action by the epa to impose new standards and reporting requirements regarding ghg emissions continues as a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businesses to the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible effect of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted13air emissionsour operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including our processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require that we obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa continues to adopt amendments to its regulations regarding maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule the most recent being january 14 2013 compressors and back up electrical generators used by our interstate pipelines field services and natural gas distribution segments are generally compliant additional rules are expected to be proposed by the epa this year for compliance by 2016 which could require an additional 50 million to 75 million in capital expenditure over the next three years we believe however that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirementsin addition on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities the finalized regulations establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks gas processing plants and certain other equipment the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with such rules is not expected to result in significant costs that would adversely impact our results of operationswater dischargesour operations are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationthe comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall 14within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsmanufactured gas plant sites cerc and its predecessors operated manufactured gas plants mgps in the past in minnesota cerc has completed remediation on two sites other than ongoing monitoring and water treatment there are five remaining sites in cercs minnesota service territory cerc believes that it has no liability with respect to two of these sitesas of december 31 2012 cerc had recorded a liability of 14 million for remediation of these minnesota sites the estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites cerc believes it has responsibility for was 6 million to 41 million based on remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years the cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size the actual remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to be remediated the participation of other potentially responsible parties prps if any and the remediation methods used the minnesota public utilities commission includes approximately 285000 annually in rates to fund normal ongoing remediation costs as of december 31 2012 cerc had collected 58 million from insurance companies to be used for future environmental remediationin addition to the minnesota sites the epa and other regulators have investigated mgp sites that were owned or operated by cerc or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates we and cerc do not expect the ultimate outcome of these investigations will have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of either us or cercasbestos some facilities owned by us contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestoscontaining materials we or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future in 2004 we sold our generating business to which most of these claims relate to a company which is now an affiliate of nrg under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliate although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time we intend to continue vigorously contesting claims that we do not consider to have merit and do not expect based on our experience to date these matters either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flowsother environmental from time to time we identify the presence of environmental contaminants on property where we conduct or have conducted operations other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future we have remediated and expect to continue to remediate identified sites consistent with our legal obligations from time to time we have received notices from regulatory authorities or others regarding our status as a prp in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants in addition we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such sites although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time we do not expect based on our experience to date these matters either individually or in the

any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in item 3 of this report summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries risk factors affecting our electric transmission amp distribution businessa substantial portion of centerpoint houstons receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operationscenterpoint houstons receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers as of december 31 2012 centerpoint houston did business with approximately 75 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable texas utility commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which centerpoint houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of last resort the texas utility commission revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case a significant portion of centerpoint houstons billed receivables from reps are from affiliates of nrg and affiliates of energy future holdings centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2012 was 158 million approximately 42 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg  any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various 17options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments centerpoint houston had received from such reprate regulation of centerpoint houstons business may delay or deny centerpoint houstons ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscenterpoint houstons rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the texas utility commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that centerpoint houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of centerpoint houstons costs and enable centerpoint houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capitaldisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution servicescenterpoint houston transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties centerpoint houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedcenterpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are seasonala significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer monthscenterpoint houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standardsthe ferc has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by centerpoint houston and other utilities within ercot the ferc has designated the nerc as the ero to promulgate standards under ferc oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system the ferc has approved the delegation by the nerc of authority for reliability in ercot to the tre a functionally independent division of ercot compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject centerpoint houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures in addition if centerpoint houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties the ams deployed throughout centerpoint houstons service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data centerpoint houston has deployed an ams throughout its service territory the deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to centerpoint houston over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in reps or the connection or disconnection of electric service unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the ams including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the ams changes in technology cybersecurity issues and factors outside the control of centerpoint houston which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse affect on centerpoint houstons results of operations financial condition and cash flows18risk factors affecting our natural gas distribution competitive natural gas sales and services interstate pipelines and field services businessesrate regulation of cercs business may delay or deny cercs ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscercs rates for gas operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions and for its interstate pipelines by the ferc based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that cerc is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of cercs costs and enable cerc to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital cercs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete directly with others in the transportation storage gathering treating and processing of natural gas which could lead to lower prices and reduced volumes either of which could have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to endusers in addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass cercs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by cerc as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural gas the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service they also compete indirectly with other forms of energy including electricity coal and fuel oils the primary competitive factor is price but recently environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider alternative forms of energy excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by cercs interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact cercs ability to recontract its available capacity when contracts expire the actions of cercs competitors could lead to lower prices which may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally any reduction in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of cercs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cercs liquidity and results of operations and financial condition cerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials increases in natural gas prices might affect cercs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for gas operations could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cercs tariff rates in addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which cerc operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and transportation volumes and revenues and ii increase the risk that cercs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cercs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangements changes in geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials affect the value of cercs transportation and storage services and its ability to recontract its available capacity when contracts expire a decline in cercs credit rating could result in cercs having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gasif cercs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when cerc was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected19the revenues and results of operations of cercs interstate pipelines and field services businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural gas and natural gas liquids and regulatory and other issues impacting our customers production decisionscercs interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins located in the midcontinent region of the united states the level of drilling and production activity in these regions is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control the primary factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is natural gas pricing a sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities a sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells other factors that impact production decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available production producers access to needed capital and the cost of that capital access to drilling rigs the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes regulatory changes include the potential for more restrictive rules governing the use of hydraulic fracturing a process used in the extraction of natural gas from shale reservoir formations and the use of water in that process because of these factors even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves to the extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced it could have an adverse effect on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls although the gathering revenues from our field services operations are primarily feebased a small portion of these revenues is related to sales of natural gas that we retain from either a usage component of our contracts or from compressor efficiencies and a reduction in natural gas prices could adversely impact these revenues ngl prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices in the past the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue the markets and prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control these factors include supply of and demand for these commodities which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factorscercs revenues and results of operations are seasonala substantial portion of cercs revenues is derived from natural gas sales and transportation thus cercs revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter monthsthe actual cost of pipelines and gathering systems under construction future pipeline gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higher than cerc anticipatessubsidiaries of cerc corp have been recently involved in significant pipeline and gathering construction projects and depending on available opportunities may from time to time be involved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering and treating system projects in the future the construction of new pipelines gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed cercs estimates these projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all the construction of new pipeline gathering treating or compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel labor shortages or delays weather delays inflation or other factors which could be material in addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost as a result there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to achieve cercs expected investment return which could adversely affect cercs financial condition results of operations or cash flowsthe states in which cerc provides regulated local gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cercs ability to operatethe public utility holding company act of 1935 to which cerc corp and its subsidiaries were subject prior to its repeal in 2005 provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their member companies following repeal of that act proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business that have sought to expand the state regulatory frameworks to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in those states some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and 20arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit rating these regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cercs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service in addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirementsrisk factors associated with our consolidated financial conditionif we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limitedas of december 31 2012 we had 98 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which includes 38 billion of nonrecourse transition and system restoration bonds as of december 31 2012 approximately 14 billion principal amount of this debt is required to be paid

of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms21as a holding company with no operations of our own we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributionswe derive all of our operating income from and hold all of our assets through our subsidiaries as a result we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations in general these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise in addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments or other distributions to us and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributionsour right to receive any assets of any subsidiary and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by uspoor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operationswe maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability in addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial positionthe use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiarieswe and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks we and our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contractsrisks common to our businesses and other riskswe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulationsour operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems gas gathering and processing systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businesses22in order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to construct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipateour insurance coverage may not be sufficient insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions centerpoint houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because centerpoint houston believes it to be cost prohibitive in the future centerpoint houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise or any such recovery may not be timely granted therefore centerpoint houston may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to othersunder some circumstances we centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we centerpoint houston and cerc no longer own these assets and businesses were previously owned by reliant energy incorporated reliant energy a predecessor of centerpoint houston directly or through subsidiaries and includemerchant energy energy trading and rep businesses transferred to rri or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of rri prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of nrg andtexas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of texas genco holdings inc texas genco in 2002 later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of nrgin connection with the organization and capitalization of rri now genon that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses reliant energy transferred to them rri also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston and cerc with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses these indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on rri and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of rri regardless of the time those liabilities arose if rri now genon were unable to satisfy a liability that has 23been so assumed in circumstances in which reliant energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer we centerpoint houston or cerc could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityprior to the distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rris trading subsidiary when the companies separated rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guaranties rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation pursuant to such agreement as amended in december 2007 rri now genon agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cercs obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation with any required collateral to be posted each december the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts which will be in effect until 2018 was approximately 73 million as of december 31 2012 based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2012 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement genon was not obligated to post any security as a result centerpoint energy returned to genon in the fourth quarter of 2012 the approximately 28 million of aggregate collateral previously posted by genon under the agreement if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations cerc could have to honor its guarantee and in such event any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cercs obligationsgenons unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade if genon were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event genon might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by genons creditors might be made against us as its former ownerreliant energy and rri genons predecessor are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in california and other markets although these matters relate to the business and operations of genon claims against reliant energy have been made on grounds that include liability of reliant energy as a controlling shareholder of genons predecessor we centerpoint houston or cerc could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us centerpoint houston or cerc and indemnification from genon were determined to be unavailable or if genon were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claimsin connection with the organization and capitalization of texas genco now an affiliate of nrg reliant energy and texas genco entered into a separation agreement in which texas genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets reliant energy transferred to it texas genco also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses in many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of centerpoint houston and centerpoint houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities the indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on texas genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of texas genco regardless of the time those liabilities arose if texas genco now an affiliate of nrg were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against and provided we or reliant energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer centerpoint houston could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityin connection with our sale of texas genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that texas genco would no longer be liable for and we would assume and agree to indemnify texas genco against liabilities that texas genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us texas genco and its related businesses now operate as subsidiaries of nrgwe or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of nrg ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliatecyberattacks acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches in the systems and technology that we use i to manage our operations and other business processes and ii to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of our businesses the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system as we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid 24reliance on communication between and among those components increases similarly the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas from our gathering processing and pipeline facilities are dependent on communications among our facilities and with thirdparty systems that may be delivering natural gas into or receiving natural gas and other products from our facilities disruption of those communications whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism may disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and gas and control these assets cyberattacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions adversely affect our reputation and subject us to possible legal claims and liability any of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition our electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas

impact our results of operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract 25resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development our costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage

impact on our business liquidity and financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions defaults of lenders in our credit facilities should they occur could adversely affect our liquidity in addition to the credit and financial market issues a recurrence of national and local recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways these include among other things reduced customer usage increased customer default rates and wide swings in commodity pricesclimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our servicesthe united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues such as the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in 2012 following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources in addition the epa expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons of co2 equivalent per year these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa as a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our servicesclimate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial

located in major producing fields in arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas other operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our business  we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering processing transportation and sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis the houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011 and each month from april through september was one of the ten warmest months on record in 2012 we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months however every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record in recent years customers have typically reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic recovery in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this growth will continue as the regions experience a continued economic recovery the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates in recent rate filings we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and variations in usage from levels reflected in rates but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions we plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our future rate filingsour field services and interstate pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to significant natural gas producing regions in texas arkansas oklahoma and louisiana in our field services business segment the development of shale formations has helped offset declines in production from more traditional basins the recent decline in natural gas prices has contributed to reductions in drilling activity in dry gas shale formations as well including those served by our field services business segment many producers have shifted their focus to liquidsrich natural gas or crude oil basins a 31reduction in drilling activity may result in lower throughput volumes on our systems as the wells decline over time however a significant amount of the volumes gathered by systems we recently developed in shale basins such as the haynesville and fayetteville shales are supported by contracts with annual volume commitments or price adjustment mechanisms that provide for minimum returns on capital deployed in monitoring performance of the segments we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems and in the case of field services on the number of wellconnects our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or var to avoid significant financial exposures lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2010 2011 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segmentthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable our goal is to continue to improve our credit ratings over time a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt we expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately 83 million in 2013 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our gas operations in texas significant eventsacquisitionon july 31 2012 we purchased the 50 interest that we did not already own in waskom gas processing company waskom a texas general partnership which owns and operates a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets as well as other gathering and related assets from a thirdparty for approximately 273 million the amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquisition of the 50 interest in waskom was approximately 201 million with the remaining purchase price allocated to the other gathering assets based on a discounted cash flow methodology the purchase of the 50 interest in waskom was determined to be a business combination achieved in stages and as such we recorded a pretax gain of approximately 136 million on july 31 2012 which is the result of remeasuring our original 50 interest in waskom to fair value as a result of the purchase we recorded goodwill of 24 million which includes 17 million related to waskom including the remeasurement of our existing 50 interest and 7 million related to the other gathering and related assetsgoodwill impairmentwe performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the competitive natural gas sales and services reportable segment we also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unitdebt financing transactionsin january 2012 centerpoint energy transition bond company iv llc bond company iv issued 1695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 09012 to 30282 and final maturity dates ranging from april 15 2018 to october 15 2025 through the

to a 24 million negative impact of marktomarket accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins 2012 included marktomarket charges of 16 million compared to a 8 million benefit for the same period of 2011 substantially offsetting this decrease was a 20 million improvement in operating margins primarily as a result of the termination of uneconomic transportation contracts and an increase in retail sales customers and volumes2011 compared to 2010 our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment reported operating income of 6 million for 2011 compared to 16 million for 2010 the decrease in operating income of 10 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of 9 million in 2011 which included a 5 million charge related to an early capacity release on pipeline transportation as compared to 2010 additionally an 11 million writedown of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market occurred in 2011 as compared to a 6 million writedown in 2010 offsetting these decreases to operating income is an increase in operating income of 4 million related to the favorable impact of the marktomarket valuation for nontrading financial derivatives for 2011 of 8 million versus the favorable impact of 4 million for 2010goodwill impairment a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 252 million for our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment was recorded in 2012 the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair

counterparties aggregate 335 million and 6 million of such amount was utilizedpipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shippers guarantor drop below a threshold level which is generally investment grade ratings from both moodys and sampp cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper if the credit ratings of cerc corp decline below the applicable threshold levels cerc corp might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as 179 million as of december 31 2012 the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels48in september 1999 we issued zens having an original principal amount of 10 billion of which 840 million remains outstanding at december 31 2012 each zens note was originally exchangeable at the holders option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95 of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to such note the number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each zens note are adjusted for certain corporate events as of december 31 2012 the reference shares for each zens note consisted of 05 share of tw common 0125505 share of time warner cable inc common stock twc common and 0045455 share of aol inc common stock aol common if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common twc common and aol common that we own or from other sources we own shares of tw common twc common and aol common equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens notes and tw common twc common and aol common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common twc common and aol common shares are sold the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december 31 2012 deferred taxes of approximately 405 million would have been payable in 2012 cross defaults under our revolving credit facility a payment default on or a nonpayment default that permits acceleration of any indebtedness exceeding 75 million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default in addition three outstanding series of our senior notes aggregating 750 million in principal amount as of december 31 2012 provide that a payment default by us cerc corp or centerpoint houston in respect of or an acceleration of borrowed money

agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds subject to certain exceptionscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment our natural gas distribution business segment and portions of our interstate pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31 2012 we had recorded regulatory assets of 43 billion and regulatory liabilities of 11 billionimpairment of longlived assets and intangibleswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including goodwill and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required 50by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of longlived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rates regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment chargewe performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the competitive natural gas sales and services reportable segment we also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unitfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month at the end of each month deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimatespension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 0 35 and 73 million for 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively we made contributions of 0 65 and 73 million in 2010 2011 and 2012 for the respective years we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 83 million in 2013 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions 51for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 8 million 10 million and 9 million in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets as of december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 618 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2013 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 86 million 78 million and 82 million for 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively of which 44 million 49 million and 67 million impacted pretax earnings  the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2012 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 800 which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of december 31 2011 we believe that our actual asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate as of december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 400 which is a 090 decrease from the 490 discount rate assumed in 2011 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2013 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 73 million of which we expect 60 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 800 and a discount rate of 400 as of december 31 2012 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 800 to 750 2013 pension cost would increase by approximately 8 million  as of december 31 2012 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 618 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 400 to 350 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2013 pension expense by approximately 126 million and 6 million respectively in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2012 by 103 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2012 of 15 million net of tax future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be52item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskimpact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity priceswe are exposed to various market risks these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through nontrading activities interest rates and equity prices a description of each market risk is set forth belowcommodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and price volatilities of commodities such as natural gas natural gas liquids and other energy commoditiesinterest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest ratesequity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securitiesmanagement has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework we manage our commodity price risk exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts during the normal course of business we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situationderivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchangederivative transactions are entered into in our nontrading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedgedinterest rate risk  as of december 31 2012 we had outstanding longterm debt lease obligations and obligations under our zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates we have no material floating rate obligationsas of december 31 2011 and 2012 we had outstanding fixedrate debt excluding indexed debt securities aggregating 87 billion and 97 billion respectively in principal amount and having a fair value of 98 billion and 109 billion respectively because these instruments are fixedrate they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note 11 to our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 215 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from their levels at december 31 2012 in general such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturityas discussed in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements the zens obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component the debt component of 138 million at december 31 2012 was a fixedrate obligation and therefore did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates however the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately 23 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from levels at december 31 2012 changes in the fair value of the derivative component a 268 million recorded liability at december 31 2012 are recorded in our statements of consolidated income and therefore we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying riskfree interest rate if the riskfree interest rate were to increase by 10 from december 31 2012 levels the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately 7 million which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income53equity market value riskwe are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of 72 million shares of tw common 18 million shares of twc common and 07 million shares of aol common which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens please read note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our zens obligation a decrease of 10 from the december 31 2012 aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of approximately 15 million which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated incomecommodity price risk from nontrading activitieswe use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses the standalone commodity risk created by these instruments without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge is described below we measure the commodity risk of our nontrading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis performed on our nontrading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10 movement in energy prices at december 31 2012 the recorded fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives was a net asset of 17 million before collateral all of which is related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment an increase of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their december 31 2012 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives net asset by 1 million the above analysis of the nontrading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our nonderivative physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate furthermore the nontrading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions54item 8 financial statements and supplementary datareport of independent registered public accounting firmto the board of directors and shareholders ofcenterpoint energy

or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation for goodwill is performed by using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the differencecenterpoint energy performed its annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the competitive natural gas sales and services reportable segment centerpoint energy also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment other intangibles were not material as of december 31 2011 and 2012centerpoint energy estimated the value of the competitive natural gas sales and services reporting unit using an income approach under this approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using the present value of future expected cash flows which are based on management projections of revenue growth gross margin and overall market conditions these estimated future cash flows are then discounted using a rate that approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a market participantthe competitive natural gas sales and services reporting unit fair value analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 83 million for this reporting unit and as a result a noncash impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2012 the adverse wholesale market conditions facing centerpoint energys energy services business 67specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit5regulatory mattersa regulatory assets and liabilitiesthe following is a list of regulatory assetsliabilities reflected on

similar instruments in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability fair value assets and liabilities that are generally included in this category are derivatives with fair values based on inputs from actively quoted markets a market approach is utilized to value centerpoint energys level 2 assets or liabilitieslevel 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and include situations where there is little if any market activity for the asset or liability unobservable inputs reflect centerpoint energys judgments about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability since limited market data exists centerpoint energy develops these inputs based on the best information available including centerpoint energys own data a market approach is utilized to value centerpoint energys level 3 assets or liabilities currently centerpoint energys level 3 assets and liabilities are comprised of
