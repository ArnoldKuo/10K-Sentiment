located in major producing fields in arkansas louisiana oklahoma and texas other operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our business  we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering processing transportation and sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis the houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011 and each month from april through september was one of the ten warmest months on record in 2012 we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months however every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record in recent years customers have typically reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic recovery in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this growth will continue as the regions experience a continued economic recovery the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates in recent rate filings we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and variations in usage from levels reflected in rates but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions we plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our future rate filingsour field services and interstate pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to significant natural gas producing regions in texas arkansas oklahoma and louisiana in our field services business segment the development of shale formations has helped offset declines in production from more traditional basins the recent decline in natural gas prices has contributed to reductions in drilling activity in dry gas shale formations as well including those served by our field services business segment many producers have shifted their focus to liquidsrich natural gas or crude oil basins a 31reduction in drilling activity may result in lower throughput volumes on our systems as the wells decline over time however a significant amount of the volumes gathered by systems we recently developed in shale basins such as the haynesville and fayetteville shales are supported by contracts with annual volume commitments or price adjustment mechanisms that provide for minimum returns on capital deployed in monitoring performance of the segments we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems and in the case of field services on the number of wellconnects our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or var to avoid significant financial exposures lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2010 2011 and 2012 adversely affected results for this business segmentthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable our goal is to continue to improve our credit ratings over time a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt we expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately 83 million in 2013 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our gas operations in texas significant eventsacquisitionon july 31 2012 we purchased the 50 interest that we did not already own in waskom gas processing company waskom a texas general partnership which owns and operates a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets as well as other gathering and related assets from a thirdparty for approximately 273 million the amount of the purchase price allocated to the acquisition of the 50 interest in waskom was approximately 201 million with the remaining purchase price allocated to the other gathering assets based on a discounted cash flow methodology the purchase of the 50 interest in waskom was determined to be a business combination achieved in stages and as such we recorded a pretax gain of approximately 136 million on july 31 2012 which is the result of remeasuring our original 50 interest in waskom to fair value as a result of the purchase we recorded goodwill of 24 million which includes 17 million related to waskom including the remeasurement of our existing 50 interest and 7 million related to the other gathering and related assetsgoodwill impairmentwe performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the competitive natural gas sales and services reportable segment we also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unitdebt financing transactionsin january 2012 centerpoint energy transition bond company iv llc bond

segment reported operating income excluding the goodwill impairment discussed below of 2 million for 2012 compared to 6 million for 2011 the decrease in operating income of 4 million was primarily due to a 24 million negative impact of marktomarket accounting for derivatives associated with certain forward natural gas purchases and sales used to lock in economic margins 2012 included marktomarket charges of 16 million compared to a 8 million benefit for the same period of 2011 substantially offsetting this decrease was a 20 million improvement in operating margins primarily as a result of the termination of uneconomic transportation contracts and an increase in retail sales customers and volumes2011 compared to 2010 our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment reported operating income of 6 million for 2011 compared to 16 million for 2010 the decrease in operating income of 10 million was primarily due to reduced basis spreads on pipeline transport opportunities and decreased seasonal storage spreads of 9 million in 2011 which included a 5 million charge related to an early capacity release on pipeline transportation as compared to 2010 additionally an 11 million writedown of natural gas inventory to the lower of cost or market occurred in 2011 as compared to a 6 million writedown in 2010 offsetting these decreases to operating income is an increase in operating income of 4 million related to the favorable impact of the marktomarket valuation for nontrading financial derivatives for 2011 of 8 million versus the favorable impact of 4 million for 2010goodwill impairment a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 252 million for our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment was recorded in 2012 the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in our estimate of the fair

events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment our natural gas distribution business segment and portions of our interstate pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31 2012 we had recorded regulatory assets of 43 billion and regulatory liabilities of 11 billionimpairment of longlived assets and intangibleswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including goodwill and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required 50by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of longlived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rates regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment chargewe performed our annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the competitive natural gas sales and services reportable segment we also determined that no impairment charge was required for any other reportable segment the adverse wholesale market conditions facing our energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unitfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month at the end of each month deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimatespension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 0 35 and 73 million for 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively we made contributions of 0 65 and 73 million in 2010 2011 and 2012 for the respective years we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 83 million in 2013 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions 51for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 8 million 10 million and 9 million in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets as of december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 618 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2013 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 86 million 78 million and 82 million for 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively of which 44 million 49 million and 67 million impacted pretax earnings  the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2012 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 800 which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of december 31 2011 we believe that our actual asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate as of december 31 2012 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 400 which is a 090 decrease from the 490 discount rate assumed in 2011 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2013 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 73 million of which we expect 60 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 800 and a discount rate of 400 as of december 31 2012 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 800 to 750 2013 pension cost would increase by approximately 8 million  as of december 31 2012 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 618 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 400 to 350 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2013 pension expense by approximately 126 million and 6 million respectively in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2012 by 103 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2012 of 15 million net of tax future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be52
