texas utility commission 1electric distribution in the electric reliability council of texas inc ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer centerpoint houstons distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders centerpoint houstons operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations centerpoint houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission texas utility commission rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the texas utility commission ercot market framework centerpoint houston is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as centerpoint houston are regulated by the texas utility commission ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 85 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of approximately 74000 megawatts mw at december 31 2012 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc these reliability standards are administered by the texas regional entity tre a functionally independent division of ercot the texas utility commission has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot independent system operator ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers unlike certain other regional power markets the ercot market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the ercot iso does not procure energy on behalf of its members other than to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system members who sell and purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and purchases of power bilaterally the ercot iso also serves as agent for procuring ancillary services for those members who elect not to provide their own ancillary services centerpoint houstons electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area centerpoint houston participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid resolution of trueup appeal in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law that led to the restructuring of certain integrated electric utilities operating within texas pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a trueup mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the texas utility commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge ctc as a rider to the utilitys tariffcenterpoint houstons integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties in march 2004 centerpoint houston filed a trueup application with the texas utility commission requesting recovery of associated costs of 37 billion excluding interest as allowed under the texas electric restructuring law in december 2004 the texas utility commission issued its final order trueup order allowing centerpoint 2houston to recover a trueup balance of approximately 23 billion which included interest through august 31 2004 and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery along with the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after august 31 2004 and certain other adjustments to reflect the impact of the trueup order in 2004 and 2005 centerpoint energy recorded a net aftertax extraordinary loss of 947 million various parties including centerpoint houston appealed the trueup order these appeals were heard first by a district court in travis county texas then by the texas third court of appeals and finally by the texas supreme court in march 2011 the texas supreme court issued a unanimous ruling on such appeals in which it affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the texas utility commission in june 2011 the texas supreme court issued a final mandate remanding the case to the texas utility commission for further proceedings the remand proceeding  in september 2011 centerpoint houston reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the texas utility commission and certain intervenors to settle the issues in the remand proceeding the settlement in october 2011 the texas utility commission approved a final order the final order in the remand proceeding consistent with the settlement the final order provided that i centerpoint houston was entitled to recover an additional trueup balance of 1695 billion the recoverable trueup balance in the remand proceeding ii no further interest would accrue on the recoverable trueup balance and iii centerpoint houston would reimburse certain parties for their reasonable rate case expenses  in october 2011 the texas utility commission also issued a financing order the financing order that authorized the issuance of transition bonds by centerpoint houston to securitize the recoverable trueup balance in january 2012 centerpoint energy transition bond company iv llc bond company iv a new special purpose subsidiary of centerpoint houston issued 1695 billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from 09012 to 30282 and final maturity dates ranging from april 15 2018 to october 15 2025 through the issuance of these transition bonds centerpoint houston recovered the recoverable trueup balance less approximately

additional 405 million 258 million aftertax will be recorded as an equity return over the life of the transition bonds customers centerpoint houston serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2012 centerpoint houstons customers consisted of approximately 75 reps which sell electricity to over two million metered customers in centerpoint houstons certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside centerpoint houstons certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the texas utility commission sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg energy inc nrg represented approximately 38 36 and 39 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings corp energy future holdings represented approximately 12 11 and 10 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2012 was 158 million approximately 42 and 2 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively centerpoint houston does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid in december 2008 centerpoint houston received approval from the texas utility commission to deploy an advanced metering system ams across its service territory during the following five years centerpoint houston began installing advanced meters in march 2009 in may 2012 centerpoint houston substantially completed the deployment of the advanced metering system having installed approximately 22 million smart meters this technology should encourage greater energy conservation by giving houstonarea electric consumers the ability to better monitor and manage their electric use and its cost in near real time to recover the cost of the ams the texas utility commission approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years for the first 24 months which began in february 2009 the surcharge for residential customers was 324 per month beginning in february 2011 the surcharge was reduced to 305 per month in september 2011 the surcharge duration was reduced from 12 years to approximately six years for residential customers and approximately eight years for commercial customers the surcharge 3amounts or duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  centerpoint houston is also pursuing deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy that involves the implementation of an intelligent grid ig which would provide ondemand data and information about the status of facilities on its system although this technology is still in the developmental stage centerpoint houston believes it has the potential to provide an improvement in grid planning operations maintenance and customer service for the centerpoint houston distribution system these improvements are expected to result in fewer and shorter outages better customer service improved operations costs improved security and more effective use of our workforce we expect to include the costs of the deployment in future rate proceedings before the texas utility commission in october 2009 the us department of energy doe selected centerpoint houston for a 200 million grant to help fund its ams and ig projects as of december 31 2011 centerpoint houston had received substantially all of the 200 million of grant funding from the doe centerpoint houston used 150 million of the grant funding to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012 instead of 2014 as originally scheduled centerpoint houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately 660 million for the installation of the advanced meters and corresponding communication and data management systems were incurred over the advanced meter deployment period centerpoint houston is using the other 50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig which covers approximately 12 of its service territory this initial deployment is expected to be completed in 2014 it is expected that the capital portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe will cost approximately 140 million competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in centerpoint houstons service area in order for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in centerpoint houstons territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the texas utility commission and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in centerpoint houstons service area at this time distributed generation could result in a reduction of demand for centerpoint houstons electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months properties all of centerpoint houstons properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands

natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal in 2012 approximately 66 of the total throughput of gas operations business occurred in the first and fourth quarters these patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during those periods supply and transportation in 2012 gas operations purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years major suppliers in 2012 included bp energy companybp canada 5energy marketing 122 of supply volumes tenaska

provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors gas operations has entered into various asset management agreements associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally these asset management agreements are contracts between gas operations and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements gas operations agreed to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for gas operations and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for gas operations gas operations is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part

subsidiary of encana corporation encana and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell plc shell to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain haynesville shale and bossier shale formations in texas and louisiana under the longterm agreements encana or shell may elect to require cefs to expand the capacity of its gathering systems by up to an additional 13 bcf per day cefs estimates that the cost to expand the capacity of its gathering systems by an additional 13 bcf per day would be as much as 440 million encana and shell would provide incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand system capacity in may 2012 cefs purchased the amoruso gathering system located in east texas and related assets from a subsidiary of encana for approximately 89 million in connection with this acquisition cefs entered into a 15year gathering agreement with encana to gather and treat its natural gas production from the amoruso and hilltop fields located in robertson and leon counties in east texas the gathering agreement includes volume commitments and an acreage dedication as of the end of 2012 the amoruso gathering system had nearly 200 mmcf per day of natural gas throughput primarily from the deep bossier and cotton valley lime formations waskom gas processing company prior to july 31 2012 centerpoint

december 2006 congress enacted the pipeline inspection protection enforcement and safety act of 2006 2006 act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act these programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration under the 2002 act remediation activities are to be performed over a 10year period our pipeline subsidiaries met this initial time frame for completion of the base line assessments and are currently performing reassessments as requiredpursuant to the 2006 act the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa at the department of transportation dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our pipeline subsidiaries met this deadline pursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 201111in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirementswe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs interstate and intrastate pipelines and natural gas distribution companies and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 act by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to dots enforcement actions and penalties if we fail to comply with pipeline regulationsenvironmental mattersour operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems gas gathering and processing systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businessesin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time toconstruct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate 12future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonablebased on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you however that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of all material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changein recent years there has been increasing public debate regarding the potential impact on global climate change by various greenhouse gases ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane the principal component of the natural gas that we transport and deliver to customers the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues such as the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in 2012 following a finding by the us environmental protection agency epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning january 2 2011 the other regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january 2 2011 also the epa adopted its mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule that requires the annual calculation and reporting of ghg emissions from natural gas transmission gathering processing and distribution systems and electric distribution systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year these additional reporting requirements began in 2012 and we are currently in compliance these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa although the adoption of new legislation is uncertain action by the epa to impose new standards and reporting requirements regarding ghg emissions continues as a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businesses to the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible effect of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted13air emissionsour operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including our processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require that we obtain preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa continues to adopt amendments to its regulations regarding maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule the most recent being january 14 2013 compressors and back up electrical generators used by our interstate pipelines field services and natural gas distribution segments are generally compliant additional rules are expected to be proposed by the epa this year for compliance by 2016 which could require an additional 50 million to 75 million in capital expenditure over the next three years we believe however that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirementsin addition on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities the finalized regulations establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks gas processing plants and certain other equipment the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with such rules is not expected to result in significant costs that would adversely impact our results of operationswater dischargesour operations are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationthe comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall 14within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsmanufactured gas plant sites cerc and its predecessors operated manufactured gas plants mgps in the past in minnesota cerc has completed remediation on two sites other than ongoing monitoring and water treatment there are five remaining sites in cercs minnesota service territory cerc believes that it has no liability with respect to two of these sitesas of december 31 2012 cerc had recorded a liability of 14 million for remediation of these minnesota sites the estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites cerc believes it has responsibility for was 6 million to 41 million based on remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years the cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size the actual remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to be remediated the participation of other potentially responsible parties prps if any and the remediation methods used the minnesota public utilities commission includes approximately 285000 annually in rates to fund normal ongoing remediation costs as of december 31 2012 cerc had collected 58 million from insurance companies to be used for future environmental remediationin addition to the minnesota sites the epa and other regulators have investigated mgp sites that were owned or operated by cerc or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates we and cerc do not expect the ultimate outcome of these investigations will have a material adverse impact on the financial condition results of operations or cash flows of either us or cercasbestos some facilities owned by us contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestoscontaining materials we or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future in 2004 we sold our generating business to which most of these claims relate to a company which is now an affiliate of nrg under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliate although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time we intend to continue vigorously contesting claims that we do not consider to have merit and do not expect based on our experience to date these matters either individually or in the aggregate to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or cash flowsother environmental from time to time we identify the presence of environmental contaminants on property where we conduct or have conducted operations other such sites involving contaminants may be identified in the future we have remediated and expect to continue to remediate identified sites consistent with our legal obligations from time to time we have received notices from regulatory authorities or others regarding our status as a prp in connection with sites found to require remediation due to the presence of environmental contaminants in addition we have been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation related to such sites although the ultimate outcome of such matters cannot be predicted at this time we do not expect based on our experience to date these matters either individually or in the

any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in item 3 of this report summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by each of these subsidiaries risk factors affecting our electric transmission amp distribution businessa substantial portion of centerpoint houstons receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operationscenterpoint houstons receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers as of december 31 2012 centerpoint houston did business with approximately 75 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable texas utility commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which centerpoint houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the provider of last resort the texas utility commission revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case a significant portion of centerpoint houstons billed receivables from reps are from affiliates of nrg and affiliates of energy future holdings centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2012 was 158 million approximately 42 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg  any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various 17options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments centerpoint houston had received from such reprate regulation of centerpoint houstons business may delay or deny centerpoint houstons ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscenterpoint houstons rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the texas utility commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that centerpoint houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of centerpoint houstons costs and enable centerpoint houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capitaldisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution servicescenterpoint houston transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties centerpoint houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedcenterpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are seasonala significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer monthscenterpoint houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standardsthe ferc has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by centerpoint houston and other utilities within ercot the ferc has designated the nerc as the ero to promulgate standards under ferc oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system the ferc has approved the delegation by the nerc of authority for reliability in ercot to the tre a functionally independent division of ercot compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject centerpoint houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures in addition if centerpoint houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties the ams deployed throughout centerpoint houstons service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data centerpoint houston has deployed an ams throughout its service territory the deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to centerpoint houston over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in reps or the connection or disconnection of electric service unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the ams including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the ams changes in technology cybersecurity issues and factors outside the control of centerpoint houston which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse affect on centerpoint houstons results of operations financial condition and cash flows18risk factors affecting our natural gas distribution competitive natural gas sales and services interstate pipelines and field services businessesrate regulation of cercs business may delay or deny cercs ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscercs rates for gas operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions and for its interstate pipelines by the ferc based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that cerc is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of cercs costs and enable cerc to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital cercs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas and its interstate pipelines and field services businesses must compete directly with others in the transportation storage gathering treating and processing of natural gas which could lead to lower prices and reduced volumes either of which could have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to endusers in addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass cercs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by cerc as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs two interstate pipelines and its gathering systems compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines and gathering systems in the transportation and storage of natural gas the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service they also compete indirectly with other forms of energy including electricity coal and fuel oils the primary competitive factor is price but recently environmental considerations have grown in importance when consumers consider alternative forms of energy excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by cercs interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact cercs ability to recontract its available capacity when contracts expire the actions of cercs competitors could lead to lower prices which may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally any reduction in the volume of natural gas transported or stored may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of cercs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cercs liquidity and results of operations and financial condition cerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials increases in natural gas prices might affect cercs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for gas operations could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cercs tariff rates in addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which cerc operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and transportation volumes and revenues and ii increase the risk that cercs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cercs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangements changes in geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials affect the value of cercs transportation and storage services and its ability to recontract its available capacity when contracts expire a decline in cercs credit rating could result in cercs having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gasif cercs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when cerc was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected19the revenues and results of operations of cercs interstate pipelines and field services businesses are subject to fluctuations in the supply and price of natural gas and natural gas liquids and regulatory and other issues impacting our customers production decisionscercs interstate pipelines and field services businesses largely rely on natural gas sourced in the various supply basins located in the midcontinent region of the united states the level of drilling and production activity in these regions is dependent on economic and business factors beyond our control the primary factor affecting both the level of drilling activity and production volumes is natural gas pricing a sustained decline in natural gas prices could result in a decrease in exploration and development activities in the regions served by our gathering and pipeline transportation systems and our natural gas treating and processing activities a sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells other factors that impact production decisions include the level of production costs relative to other available production producers access to needed capital and the cost of that capital access to drilling rigs the ability of producers to obtain necessary drilling and other governmental permits and regulatory changes regulatory changes include the potential for more restrictive rules governing the use of hydraulic fracturing a process used in the extraction of natural gas from shale reservoir formations and the use of water in that process because of these factors even if new natural gas reserves are discovered in areas served by our assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves or to shut in production from existing reserves to the extent the availability of this supply is substantially reduced it could have an adverse effect on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs revenues from these businesses are also affected by the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids ngls although the gathering revenues from our field services operations are primarily feebased a small portion of these revenues is related to sales of natural gas that we retain from either a usage component of our contracts or from compressor efficiencies and a reduction in natural gas prices could adversely impact these revenues ngl prices generally fluctuate on a basis that correlates to fluctuations in crude oil prices in the past the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been extremely volatile and we expect this volatility to continue the markets and prices for natural gas ngls and crude oil depend upon factors beyond our control these factors include supply of and demand for these commodities which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and other factorscercs revenues and results of operations are seasonala substantial portion of cercs revenues is derived from natural gas sales and transportation thus cercs revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter monthsthe actual cost of pipelines and gathering systems under construction future pipeline gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may be significantly higher than cerc anticipatessubsidiaries of cerc corp have been recently involved in significant pipeline and gathering construction projects and depending on available opportunities may from time to time be involved in additional significant pipeline construction and gathering and treating system projects in the future the construction of new pipelines gathering and treating systems and related compression facilities may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed cercs estimates these projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all the construction of new pipeline gathering treating or compression facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel and nickel labor shortages or delays weather delays inflation or other factors which could be material in addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost as a result there is the risk that the new facilities may not be able to achieve cercs expected investment return which could adversely affect cercs financial condition results of operations or cash flowsthe states in which cerc provides regulated local gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cercs ability to operatethe public utility holding company act of 1935 to which cerc corp and its subsidiaries were subject prior to its repeal in 2005 provided a comprehensive regulatory structure governing the organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their member companies following repeal of that act proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business that have sought to expand the state regulatory frameworks to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over similar aspects of the utilities that operate in those states some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and 20arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit rating these regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cercs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service in addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirementsrisk factors associated with our consolidated financial conditionif

of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable terms21as a holding company with no operations of our own we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries to meet our payment obligations and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributionswe derive all of our operating income from and hold all of our assets through our subsidiaries as a result we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries in order to meet our payment obligations in general these subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise in addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments or other distributions to us and our subsidiaries could agree to

affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operationswe maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability in addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial positionthe use of derivative contracts by us and our subsidiaries in the normal course of business could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiarieswe and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks we and our subsidiaries could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contractsrisks common to our businesses and other riskswe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulationsour operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems gas gathering and processing systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gas or the ability to extract natural gas in areas we serve in our interstate pipelines and field services businesses22in order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to construct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipateour insurance coverage may not be sufficient insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions centerpoint houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because centerpoint houston believes it to be cost prohibitive in the future centerpoint houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise or any such recovery may not be timely granted therefore centerpoint houston may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to othersunder some circumstances we centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we centerpoint houston and cerc no longer own these assets and businesses were previously owned by reliant energy incorporated reliant energy a predecessor of centerpoint houston directly or through subsidiaries and includemerchant energy energy trading and rep businesses transferred to rri or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of rri prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of nrg andtexas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of texas genco holdings inc texas genco in 2002 later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of nrgin connection with the organization and capitalization of rri now genon that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses reliant energy transferred to them rri also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston and cerc with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses these indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on rri and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of rri regardless of the time those liabilities arose if rri now genon were unable to satisfy a liability that has 23been so assumed in circumstances in which reliant energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer we centerpoint houston or cerc could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityprior to the distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rris trading subsidiary when the companies separated rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guaranties rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation pursuant to such agreement as amended in december 2007 rri now genon agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cercs obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation with any required collateral to be posted each december the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts which will be in effect until 2018 was approximately 73 million as of december 31 2012 based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2012 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement genon was not obligated to post any security as a result centerpoint energy returned to genon in the fourth quarter of 2012 the approximately 28 million of aggregate collateral previously posted by genon under the agreement if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations cerc could have to honor its guarantee and in such event any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cercs obligationsgenons unsecured debt ratings are currently below investment grade if genon were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event genon might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by genons creditors might be made against us as its former ownerreliant energy and rri genons predecessor are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in california and other markets although these matters relate to the business and operations of genon claims against reliant energy have been made on grounds that include liability of reliant energy as a controlling shareholder of genons predecessor we centerpoint houston or cerc could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us centerpoint houston or cerc and indemnification from genon were determined to be unavailable or if genon were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claimsin connection with the organization and capitalization of texas genco now an affiliate of nrg reliant energy and texas genco entered into a separation agreement in which texas genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets reliant energy transferred to it texas genco also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses in many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of centerpoint houston and centerpoint houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities the indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on texas genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of texas genco regardless of the time those liabilities arose if texas genco now an affiliate of nrg were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against and provided we or reliant energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer centerpoint houston could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityin connection with our sale of texas genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that texas genco would no longer be liable for and we would assume and agree to indemnify texas genco against liabilities that texas genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us texas genco and its related businesses now operate as subsidiaries of nrgwe or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of nrg ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliatecyberattacks acts of terrorism or other disruptions could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe are subject to cybersecurity risks related to breaches in the systems and technology that we use i to manage our operations and other business processes and ii to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of our businesses the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system as we deploy smart meters and the intelligent grid 24reliance on communication between and among those components increases similarly the distribution of natural gas to our customers and the gathering processing and transportation of natural gas from our gathering processing and pipeline facilities are dependent on communications among our facilities and with thirdparty systems that may be delivering natural gas into or receiving natural gas and other products from our facilities disruption of those communications whether caused by physical disruption such as storms or other natural phenomena by failure of equipment or technology or by manmade events such as cyberattacks or acts of terrorism may disrupt our ability to deliver electricity and gas and control these assets cyberattacks could also result in the loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of other information technology systems that could disrupt our operations and critical business functions adversely affect our reputation and subject us to possible legal claims and liability any of which could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition our electrical distribution and transmission facilities and gas distribution and pipeline systems may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to conduct our business and have a material adverse affect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our results of operations financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully operate our facilities or perform certain

permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate we may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited we may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which

management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards controls and procedures failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operations our business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract 25resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development our costs including costs for contractors to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage

global financial system may have impacts on our business liquidity and financial condition that we currently cannot predictthe continued unsettled conditions in the global financial system may have an impact on our business liquidity and financial condition our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like or need to access those markets which could have an impact on our liquidity and flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions in addition the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions defaults of lenders in our credit facilities should they occur could adversely affect our liquidity in addition to the credit and financial market issues a recurrence of national and local recessionary conditions may impact our business in a variety of ways these include among other things reduced customer usage increased customer default rates and wide swings in commodity pricesclimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our servicesthe united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues such as the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in 2012 following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources in addition the epa expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons of co2 equivalent per year these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa as a distributor and transporter of natural gas and consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our servicesclimate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted
