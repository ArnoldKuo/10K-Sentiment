centerpoint houston nor any other subsidiary of centerpoint energy makes direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or owns or operates any electric generating facilities electric transmission on behalf of retail electric providers reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts kv in locations throughout centerpoint houstons certificated service territory centerpoint houston constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commission1 electric distribution in the electric reliability council of texas inc ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer centerpoint houstons distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders centerpoint houstons operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations centerpoint houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission texas utility commission rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the texas utility commission ercot market framework centerpoint houston is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as centerpoint houston are regulated by the texas utility commission ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of over 77000 megawatts mw at december 31 2014 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc these reliability standards are administered by the texas regional entity tre a functionally independent division of ercot the texas utility commission has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot independent system operator ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers unlike certain other regional power markets the ercot market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the ercot iso does not procure energy on behalf of its members other than to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system members who sell and purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and purchases of power bilaterally the ercot iso also serves as agent for procuring ancillary services for those members who elect not to provide their own ancillary services centerpoint houstons electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area centerpoint houston participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid restructuring of the texas electric market in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the texas utility commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff centerpoint houstons integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties ultimately centerpoint houston was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of centerpoint houston the transition bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in centerpoint houstons service territory as of december 31 2014 approximately 26 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstanding2customers centerpoint houston serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2014 centerpoint houstons customers consisted of approximately 70 reps which sell electricity to over two million metered customers in centerpoint houstons certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside centerpoint houstons certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the texas utility commission sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg energy inc nrg represented approximately 37 38 and 39 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings corp energy future holdings represented approximately 10 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in each of 2014 2013 and 2012 centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2014 was 195 million approximately 36 and 10 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively centerpoint houston does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid  in may 2012 centerpoint houston substantially completed the deployment of an advanced metering system ams having installed approximately 22 million smart meters to recover the cost of the ams the texas utility commission approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years and later reduced to six years as a result of us department of energy doe grant funds the surcharge is currently set to expire in 2015 for residential customers and in 2016 to 2017 for nonresidential customers the surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  centerpoint houston is also pursuing deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy that involves the implementation of an intelligent grid ig which would provide ondemand data and information about the status of facilities on its system we expect to include the costs of the deployment in future rate proceedings before the texas utility commission in october 2009 the doe selected centerpoint houston for a 200 million grant to help fund its ams and ig projects centerpoint houston received substantially all of the 200 million of grant funding from the doe by 2011 and used 150 million of it to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012 centerpoint houston is using the other 50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig that covers approximately 12 of its service territory the doefunded portion of the ig project is expected to be completed in 2015 and the capital portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe will cost approximately 140 million competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in centerpoint houstons service area in order for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in centerpoint houstons territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the texas utility commission and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in centerpoint houstons service area at this time distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for centerpoint houstons electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months properties all of centerpoint houstons properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of centerpoint houstons 3transmission and

natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal in 2014 approximately 71 of the total throughput of ngds business occurred in the first and fourth quarters these patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months supply and transportation in 2014 ngd purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years major suppliers in 2014 included bp energy companybp canada energy marketing 158 of supply volumes tenaska marketing ventures

interstate pipelines including those owned by our other subsidiaries and affiliates under contracts with remaining terms including extensions varying from one to ten years ngd anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration ngd actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities these price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion the regulations of the states in which ngd operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually the changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies ngd uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather and may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored liquefied natural gas and propaneair plant production ngd owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 billion cubic feet bcf it has a working capacity of 20 bcf available for use during the heating season and a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 50 million cubic feet mmcf it also owns eight propaneair plants with a total production rate of 180000 dekatherms dth per day and onsite storage facilities for 12

production rate of 72000 dth per day  on an ongoing basis ngd enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors 5ngd has entered into various asset management agreements associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally these asset management agreements are contracts between ngd and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements ngd agreed to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for ngd and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for ngd ngd is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization ngd has received approval from the state regulatory commissions in arkansas louisiana mississippi and oklahoma to retain a share of the asset management agreement proceeds the agreements have varying terms the longest of which expires in 2018 assets as of december 31 2014 ngd owned approximately 73000 linear miles of natural gas

of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration pursuant to the 2006 act the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa at the department of transportation dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our natural gas distribution systems met this deadlinepursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 2011 in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirementswe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs natural gas distribution companies and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the

regulation above  natural gas gathering pipeline regulation  section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc although the ferc has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities enable considers to be gathering facilities it believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables results of operations and cash flows in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the ferc  states may regulate gathering pipelines state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances requirements prohibiting undue discrimination and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate these statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply and have the effect of restricting enables right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas  enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes  crude oil gathering regulation  enable provides interstate transportation on its crude oil gathering system in north dakota pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with ferc regulatory requirements crude oil gathering pipelines that provide interstate transportation service may be regulated as a common carrier by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica the energy policy act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and ferc regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and are to be nondiscriminatory or not confer any undue preference upon any shipper ferc regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the ferc and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service under the ica the ferc or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services the ferc is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months a successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect the ferc may also order a pipeline to change its rates and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint  for some time now the ferc has been issuing regulatory assurances that necessarily balance the antidiscrimination and undue preference requirements of common carriage with the expectations of investors in new and expanding petroleum pipelines there is an inherent tension between the requirements imposed upon a common carrier and the need for owners of petroleum pipelines to be able to enter into longterm firm contracts with shippers willing to make the commitments which underpin such large capital investments the fercs solution has been to allow carriers to hold an open season prior to the inservice date of pipeline during which time interested shippers can make commitments to the proposed pipeline project throughput commitments from interested shippers during an open season can be for firm service or for nonfirm service typically such an open season is for a 30day period must be publicly announced and culminates in interested parties entering into transportation agreements with the carrier under ferc precedent a carrier typically may reserve up to 90 of available capacity for the provision of firm service to shippers making a commitment at least 10 of capacity ordinarily is reserved for walkup shippers 12 midstream investments  safety and health regulation  certain of enables facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations phmsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction

phmsas pipeline safety regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject to the pipeline safety regulations only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines in addition several ngl pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines pursuant to various federal statutes including the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968 ngpsa the dot through phmsa regulates pipeline safety and integrity ngl and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by phmsa under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act which

associated with its nonexempt pipelines additionally should enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines if future dot pipeline integrity management regulations were to require that enable expand its integrity managements program to currently unregulated pipelines including gathering lines its costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operationsenvironmental mattersour operations and the operations of enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas distribution systems electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activitiesconstruct or acquire new facilities and equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment13the recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonablebased on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changein recent years there has been increasing public debate regarding the potential impact on global climate change by various greenhouse gases ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane the principal component of the natural gas that we transport and deliver to customers the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues following a finding by the us environmental protection agency epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning january 2 2011 the other regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january 2 2011 also the epa adopted its mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule that requires the annual calculation and reporting of ghg emissions from natural gas transmission gathering processing and distribution systems and electric distribution systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year these additional reporting requirements began in 2012 and we are currently in compliance these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa although the adoption of new legislation is uncertain action by the epa to impose new standards and reporting requirements regarding ghg emissions continues on january 14 2015 the epa announced that it will issue a proposed rule in the summer of 2015 and a final rule in 2016 setting standards for methane and volatile organic compound voc emissions from new and modified oil and gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources as part of the same announcement phmsa stated that it will propose natural gas pipeline safety standards in 2015 that are expected to reduce methane emissions furthermore in december 2014 the epa proposed changes to its ghg reporting rule that would require additional reporting from natural gas transmission pipelines in addition many states and regions of the united states have begun to regulate ghgs cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businesses to the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and enables businesses could experience lower revenues on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible effect of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes 14could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedair emissionsour operations and the operations of enable are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions we may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa continues to adopt amendments to its regulations regarding maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule the most recent being january 14 2013 on august 29 2013 the epa announced that it was reconsidering three issues related to the rice mact rule but on august 15 2014 the epa determined that it would not propose any changes to the regulations at this time compressors and back up electrical generators used by our natural gas distribution segment and back up electrical generators used by our electric transmission amp distribution segment are generally compliant with existing regulations in addition on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities the finalized regulations establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks gas processing plants and certain other equipment the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with such rules is not expected to result in significant costs that would adversely impact our results of operationswater dischargesour operations and the operations of enable are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations

spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states

remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations and the operations of enable generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirements15liability for remediationthe comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsmanufactured gas plant sites cerc and its predecessors operated manufactured gas plants mgps in the past there are seven mgp sites in

ordered remediation other than ongoing monitoring and water treatmentas of december 31 2014 cerc had recorded a liability of 7 million for remediation of these minnesota sites the estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites cerc believes it has responsibility for was 5 million to 29 million based on remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years the cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size the actual remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to be remediated the participation of other potentially responsible parties prps if any and the remediation methods used as of december 31 2014 cerc had collected 4 million from insurance companies to be used for future environmental remediationin addition to the minnesota sites the epa and other regulators have investigated mgp sites that were owned or operated by cerc or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates we and

facilities owned by us contain or have contained asbestos insulation and other asbestoscontaining materials we or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as defendants in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries in 2004 we sold our generating business to which most of these claims relate to a company which is now an affiliate of nrg under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliate we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future although their ultimate outcome cannot be predicted at this time we intend to continue vigorously contesting
