service territory centerpoint houston constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commission electric distribution in the electric reliability council of texas inc ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer centerpoint houstons distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders centerpoint houstons operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations centerpoint houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission texas utility commission rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the texas utility commission ercot market framework centerpoint houston is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as centerpoint houston are regulated by the texas utility commission ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of over 77000 megawatts mw as of december 31 2015 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc within ercot these reliability standards are administered by the texas reliability entity tre the texas utility commission has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot independent system operator ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers  centerpoint houstons electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area centerpoint houston participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid restructuring of the texas electric market in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the texas utility commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff centerpoint houstons integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties ultimately centerpoint houston was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of centerpoint houston the transition bonds 2are repaid through charges imposed on customers in centerpoint houstons service territory as of december 31 2015 approximately 23 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstandingcustomers centerpoint houston serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2015 centerpoint houstons customers consisted of approximately 69 reps which sell electricity to over 23 million metered customers in centerpoint houstons certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside centerpoint houstons certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the texas utility commission sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg energy inc nrg represented approximately 35 37 and 38 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings corp energy future holdings represented approximately 10 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in each of 2015 2014 and 2013 centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2015 was 195 million approximately 34 and 11 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively centerpoint houston does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid  in may 2012 centerpoint houston substantially completed the deployment of an advanced metering system ams having installed approximately 22 million smart meters to recover the cost of the ams the texas utility commission approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years and later reduced to six years as a result of us department of energy doe grant funds the surcharge expired in 2015 for residential customers and is set to expire in 2016 to 2017 for nonresidential customers the surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  centerpoint houston is also pursuing deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy that involves the implementation of an intelligent grid ig which would provide ondemand data and information about the status of facilities on its system we expect to include the costs of the deployment in future rate proceedings before the texas utility commission in october 2009 the doe selected centerpoint houston for a 200 million grant to help fund its ams and ig projects centerpoint houston received substantially all of the 200 million of grant funding from the doe by 2011 and used 150 million of it to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012 centerpoint houston used the other 50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig that covers approximately 12 of its service territory the doefunded portion of the ig project was substantially completed in 2015 and the capital portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe cost approximately 140 million competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in centerpoint houstons service area in order for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in centerpoint houstons territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the texas utility commission and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in centerpoint houstons service area at this time distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for centerpoint houstons electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months 3properties all of centerpoint houstons properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of centerpoint houstons transmission and

natural gas sales and transportation for commercial and industrial customers is seasonal in 2015 approximately 68 of the total throughput of ngds business occurred in the first and fourth quarters these patterns reflect the higher demand for natural gas for heating purposes during the colder months supply and transportation in 2015 ngd purchased virtually all of its natural gas supply pursuant to contracts with remaining terms varying from a few months to four years major suppliers in 2015 included bp energy companybp canada energy marketing 184 of supply volumes tenaska marketing ventures

renewed or replaced prior to their expiration ngd actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities these price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion the regulations of the states in which ngd operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually the changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies ngd uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather and may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored liquefied natural gas and propaneair plant production ngd owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 billion cubic feet bcf it has a working capacity of 20 bcf available for use during the heating season and a maximum daily withdrawal rate of 50 million cubic feet mmcf it also owns eight propaneair plants with a total production rate of 180000 dekatherms dth per day and onsite storage facilities for 12 million gallons of propane 10 bcf natural gas

ongoing basis ngd enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors 5ngd has entered into various asset management agreements amas associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally these amas are contracts between ngd and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements ngd agreed to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for ngd and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for ngd ngd is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization ngd has received approval from the state regulatory commissions in arkansas louisiana mississippi and oklahoma to retain a share of the ama proceeds the agreements have varying terms the longest of which expires in 2019 assets as of december 31 2015 ngd owned approximately 74000 linear miles of natural gas distribution mains varying in size from onehalf inch to 24 inches in diameter generally in each of the cities towns and rural areas served by ngd it owns the underground gas mains and service lines metering and regulating equipment located on customers premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance with a few exceptions the measuring stations at which ngd receives gas are owned operated and maintained by others and its distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment these facilities including odorizing equipment are usually located on land owned by suppliers competition ngd competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users in addition

which reauthorized the programs adopted under the pipeline safety improvement act of 2002 2002 act these programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration pursuant to the 2006 act the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa at the department of transportation dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our natural gas distribution systems met this deadlinepursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 2011 in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirementswe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules 10will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 act by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs in

fercapproved statement of operating conditions could result in the assertion of federal nga jurisdiction by the ferc andor the imposition of administrative civil and criminal penalties as described under  interstate natural gas pipeline regulation above  natural gas gathering pipeline regulation  section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc although the ferc has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities enable considers to be gathering facilities it believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables results of operations and cash flows in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or the ngpa this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the ferc  states may regulate gathering pipelines state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances requirements prohibiting undue discrimination and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate these statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply and have the effect of restricting enables right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas  enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes  crude oil gathering regulation  enable provides interstate transportation on its crude oil gathering system in north dakota pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with ferc regulatory requirements crude oil gathering pipelines that provide interstate transportation service may be regulated as a common carrier by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica the energy policy act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and ferc regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and are to be nondiscriminatory or not confer any undue preference upon any shipper ferc regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the ferc and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service under the ica the ferc or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services the ferc is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months a successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect the ferc may also order a pipeline to change its rates and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint  for some time now the ferc has been issuing regulatory assurances that necessarily balance the antidiscrimination and undue preference requirements of common carriage with the expectations of investors in new and expanding petroleum pipelines there is an inherent tension between the requirements imposed upon a common carrier and the need for owners of petroleum 12pipelines to be able to enter into longterm firm contracts with shippers willing to make the commitments which underpin such large capital investments the fercs solution has been to allow carriers to hold an open season prior to the inservice date of pipeline during which time interested shippers can make commitments to the proposed pipeline project throughput commitments from interested shippers during an open season can be for firm service or for nonfirm service typically such an open season is for a 30day period must be publicly announced and culminates in interested parties entering into transportation agreements with the carrier under ferc precedent a carrier typically may reserve up to 90 of available capacity for the provision of firm service to shippers making a commitment at least 10 of capacity ordinarily is reserved for walkup shippers  midstream investments  safety and health regulation  certain of enables facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations phmsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities all natural gas transmission facilities such as enables interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to phmsas pipeline safety regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject to the pipeline safety regulations only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines in addition several ngl pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines pursuant to various federal statutes including the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968 ngpsa the dot through phmsa regulates pipeline safety and integrity ngl and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by phmsa under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act which requires phmsa to develop prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline and comparable state statutes with respect to design installation testing construction operation replacement and management of pipeline facilities phmsa has developed regulations that require natural gas pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in high consequence areas although many of enables pipeline facilities fall within a class that is currently not subject to these integrity management requirements enable may incur significant costs and liabilities associated with repair remediation preventive or mitigating measures associated with its nonexempt pipelines additionally should enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines if future dot pipeline integrity management regulations were to require that enable expand its integrity managements program to currently unregulated pipelines including gathering lines its costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operationsenvironmental mattersour operations and the operations of enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activitiesconstruct or acquire new facilities and equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilities13failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment for example the environmental protection agency epa has also established air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities which may affect enables midstream operations these include new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and the national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas production and processing activities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonable based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changethere is increasing attention being paid in the united states and worldwide to the issue of climate change as a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of greenhouse gases ghg on the state federal or international level some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in ghg emissions cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution business could be adversely affected through lower gas sales on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible effect of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted14air emissionsour operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions we may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and natural gas liquids production processing and transportation activities under the neshaps the epa established

detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationthe comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsmanufactured gas plant sites cerc and its predecessors operated manufactured gas plants mgps in the past with respect to certain minnesota mgp sites cerc has completed stateordered remediation and continues stateordered monitoring and water treatment as of december 31 2015 cerc had a recorded liability of 7 million for continued monitoring and any future remediation required by regulators in minnesota the estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites for which cerc 15believes it may have responsibility was 5 million to 29 million based on remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years the cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size the actual remediation costs will depend on the number of sites to be remediated the participation of other potentially responsible parties prps if any and the remediation methods used in addition to the minnesota sites the epa and other

asbestoscontaining materials we or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as defendants in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries in 2004 we sold our generating business to which most of these claims relate to a company which is now an affiliate of nrg under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliate we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in

matters  impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings in item 7 of part ii of this report these credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable termsan impairment of goodwill longlived assets including intangible assets and equitymethod investments could reduce our earningsgoodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired longlived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable for investments we account for under the equity method the impairment test considers whether the fair value of the equity investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary for example based on the sustained low enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the three months ended september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 respectively as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry we determined in connection with our preparation of financial statements for the three months ended september 30 2015 and december 31 2015 that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our investment in enable had occurred we wrote down the value of our investment in enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of 250 million as of september 30 2015 and 975 million as of december 31 2015 our total impairment loss included impairment charges totaling 1846 million composed of the impairments of our investment in enable of 1225 million and our share 621 million of impairment charges enable recorded for goodwill and longlived assets if enables unit price distributions or earnings further decline for reasons including but not limited to continued declines in commodity prices and producer activity and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in enable as of december 31 2015 the carrying value of centerpoint energys investment in enable is 1109 per unit which includes the common and subordinated units representing limited partner interests general partner interest and incentive distribution rights we hold as of december 31 2015 enables common unit price closed at 920 the lowest close price for enables common units through february 12 2016 was 580 considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment a sustained low enable common unit price or further declines in such price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future if we determine that an impairment is indicated we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization19poor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operationswe maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability in addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial

those of our subsidiaries or enablewe and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk we our subsidiaries or enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these

centerpoint houstons service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data centerpoint houston has deployed an ams throughout its service territory the deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to centerpoint houston over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in reps or the connection

to their customers as of december 31 2015 centerpoint houston did business with approximately 69 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable texas utility commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which centerpoint houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and centerpoint houston thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort the texas utility commission revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer

affect the ability of cercs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cercs liquidity and results of operations and financial conditioncerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials increases in natural gas prices might affect cercs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for ngd could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cercs tariff rates in addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which 21cerc operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that cercs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cercs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangements a decline in cercs credit rating could result in cercs having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gasif cercs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur

which cerc provides regulated local gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cercs ability to operateproposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit ratingthese regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cercs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service in addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirementscercs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas which could have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to end users in addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on

02875 per unit or 115 per unit on an annualized basis on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to its general partner and its affiliates referred to as available cash the principal difference between enables common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units its

availability of natural gas ngls and crude oil production enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its 24systems or the rate at which production from a well declines in addition enables cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants enables customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies the primary factors affecting enables ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed if enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on its gathering processing transportation and storage facilities will decline which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions which are affected by among other thingsthe availability and cost of capital prevailing and projected commodity prices including the prices of natural gas ngls and crude oildemand for natural gas ngls and crude oil levels of reserves geological considerations environmental or other governmental regulations including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipmentfluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas ngls and crude oil reserves drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease in general terms the prices of natural gas crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond enables control because of these factors even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves declines in natural gas ngl or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration development and production activity and if sustained could lead to decreases in such activity over the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years from a high of 1331 per mmbtu in july 2008 to 163 per mmbtu at december 23 2015 and 14531 per barrel in july 2008 to 2619 per barrel at february 11 2016 respectively a sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in enables areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions in addition it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on enables gathering systems and processing plants as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins should enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith enable may reduce such capital expenditures which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time in addition to capital expenditures to support growth the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time which will reduce its distributable cash flowbecause of these and other factors even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves reductions in drilling activity would result in enables inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its financial position results of operations and distributable cash flowenables industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and distributable cash flowenable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service enables competitors include large crude oil natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil than enable some of 25these competitors may expand or construct gathering processing transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services enable provides to its customers excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by enables interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact enables ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire in addition enables customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering processing transportation and storage systems in lieu of using enables systems enables ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers further natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users including electricity coal and liquid fuels increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering processing transportation and transportation services all of these competitive pressures could adversely affect enables results of operations and distributable cash flowenable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipatesenables business plan calls for investment in capital improvements and additions in enables form 10k for the year ended december 31 2015 enable stated that it expects that its expansion capital will be approximately 375 million and its maintenance capital could range from approximately 105 million to 125 million for the year ending december 31 2016 for example enable is currently constructing two cryogenic processing facilities that it plans to connect to its superheader system in grady and garvin county oklahoma which enable expects will add 400 mmcf per day of combined natural gas processing capacity enable expects that the first of the two new plants the bradley ii plant will be completed in the second quarter of 2016 enable expects that the second plant the wildhorse plant a 200 mmcf per day plant will be completed in late 2017 enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activitythe construction of additions or modifications to enables existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond enables control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed its estimates these projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all the construction of new pipeline gathering treating processing compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel labor shortages or weather or other delays inflation or other factors which could be material in addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner if at all or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost moreover enables revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline the construction may occur over an extended period of time and enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed in addition enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize as a result the new facilities may not be able to achieve enables expected investment return which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributionsin connection with enables capital investments enable may estimate or engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas to the extent enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production as a result new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return which could adversely affect enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions in addition the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rightsofway prior to construction those rightsofway to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities additionally it may become more expensive to obtain new rightsofway or to renew existing rightsofway if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rightsofway increases enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affectednatural gas ngl and crude oil prices are volatile and changes in these prices could adversely affect enables financial position results of operations and its ability to make cash distributionsenables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas ngls and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control these factors include demand for these commodities which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including the impact of seasonality and weather general economic conditions the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption the availability of imported natural gas liquefied natural gas ngls and crude oil actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil 26producing nations the availability of local intrastate and interstate transportation systems the availability and marketing of competitive fuels the impact of energy conservation efforts technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation over the course of 2015 and continuing into 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices have dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years from a high of 1331 per mmbtu in july 2008 to 163 per mmbtu at december 23 2015 and 14531 per barrel in july 2008 to 2619 per barrel at february 11 2016 respectively enables keepwhole natural gas processing arrangements which accounted for 5 of its natural gas processed volumes in 2015 expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between ngl prices and natural gas prices under these arrangements the processor processes raw natural gas to extract ngls and delivers to the producer the natural gas equivalent btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of processed natural gas the processor retains the processed ngls and to sell them for its own account accordingly the processors cost of natural gas and ngls is a function of the difference between the value of the ngls produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent btu value of those ngls therefore if natural gas prices increase and ngl prices do not increase by a corresponding amount the processor has to replace the btu of natural gas at higher prices and cost of natural gas and ngls sold are negatively affectedenables percentofproceeds and percentofliquids natural gas processing agreements accounted for 47 of its natural gas processed volumes in 2015 under percentofproceeds processing arrangements the processor generally purchases unprocessed natural gas from the producer for a purchase price that is based on published natural gas and ngl index prices the purchase price for unprocessed natural gas is calculated based on a percentage of the quantity of natural gas and ngls that would result from processing the gas purchased accordingly the processors cost of goods sold is a percentage of the index price value of the natural gas and ngls contained in the unprocessed natural gas if enable is unable to sell the processed natural gas and ngls at a higher price than it pays enables margins from sale of goods are negatively affected additionally if the amount of processed natural gas or ngls recovered during processing is less than the amount upon which the purchase price was based enables margins from sale of goods may be negatively affectedunder percentofliquids processing arrangement the processor generally purchases the ngls in unprocessed natural gas received from the producer processes the natural gas and returns the processed natural gas to the producer the purchase price for ngls is based on published ngl index prices and is calculated based on a percentage of the quantity of ngls that would result from processing the gas accordingly the processors cost of goods sold is a percentage of the index price value of ngls contained in the unprocessed natural gas if enable is unable to sell the ngls recovered during processing at a higher price than it pays enables margins from sale of goods are negatively affected additionally if the amount of ngls recovered during processing is less than the amount upon which the purchase price was based enables margins from sale of goods may be negatively affectedat any given time enables overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas and a net long position in ngls meaning that it is a net seller of ngls as a result enables gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decreases in relation to the price of natural gasenable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering businessin november 2013 enable commenced operations on its initial crude oil gathering pipeline system located in dunn and mckenzie counties in north dakota within the bakken shale formation additionally in february 2014 enable executed a crude oil gathering agreement to gather crude oil production through a new system in williams and mountrail counties in north dakota that commenced operations in the second quarter of 2015 these facilities which will have a combined capacity of 49500 barrels per day are the first crude oil gathering systems that enable has built and operated other operators of gathering systems in the bakken shale formation may have more experience in the construction operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than enable this relative lack of experience may hinder enables ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner which in turn may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholdersenable is exposed to credit risks of its customers and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by its key customers could adversely affect its cash flow and results of operationssome of enables customers may experience financial problems that could have a significant effect on their creditworthiness severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit enables ability to collect amounts owed to it or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements in addition many of enables customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to enable furthermore some of enables customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their 27own operating and regulatory risks which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to enable financial problems experienced by enables customers could result in the impairment of its assets reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services which could reduce enables revenuesenable provides certain transportation and storage

result enables costs could exceed its revenues received under such contractsenable has been authorized by the ferc to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates generally negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the ferc but it is possible that costs to perform services under negotiated rate contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements if this occurs it could decrease the cash flow realized by enables systems and therefore decrease the cash it has available for distribution as of december 31 2015 approximately 60 of enables contracted transportation firm capacity and 44 of its contracted storage firm capacity was subscribed under such negotiated rate contracts these contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the ferc successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue representing the difference between recourse rates if higher and negotiated rates is not assured under current ferc policiesif thirdparty pipelines and other facilities interconnected to enables gathering processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affectedenable depends upon thirdparty natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to and take natural gas from its transportation systems enable also depends on thirdparty facilities to transport and fractionate ngls that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted ngls into individual components for enduse sale for example an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of enables processing plants and gathering systems and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of natural gas enable gathers and ngls it is able to produce additionally enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities since enable does not own or operate any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities their continuing operation is not within its control if any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason enables results of operations and its

enables financial condition results of operations and distributable cash flows the agreements under which enable formed certain joint ventures may subject it to various risks limit the actions it may take with respect to the assets subject to the joint venture and require enable to grant rights to its joint venture partners that could limit its ability to benefit fully from future positive developments some joint ventures require enable to make significant capital expenditures if enable does not timely meet its financial commitments or otherwise does not comply with its joint venture agreements its rights to participate exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected certain of enables joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than enable has and enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint ventureenables ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sourcesenable expects that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders as a result enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures as a result to the extent enable is unable to finance growth externally enables cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow in addition because enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operationsto the extent enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit there are no limitations in enables partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that enable has to distribute to its unitholdersenable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility in addition because enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors as a result of capital market volatility enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitionsif enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms its future growth will be adversely affectedenables growth strategy includes in part the ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations if enable is unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because i it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms ii it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms or iii it is outbid by competitors then its future growth and ability to increase distributions will be adversely affected29 enables debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunitiesas of december 31 2015 enable had approximately 27 billion of longterm debt outstanding excluding the premiums on their senior notes and 363 million of longterm notes payableaffiliated companies due to cerc corp in addition enable had 236 million

including acquisitions of which 12 billion was available as of december 31 2015 enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt subject to limitations in its credit facilities the levels of enables debt could have important consequences including the followingthe ability to obtain additional financing if necessary for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms if at alla portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations future business opportunities and distributionsenables debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the

prevailing economic financial and industry conditions if market or other economic conditions deteriorate enables ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired if enable violates any of the restrictions covenants ratios or tests in its credit facilities a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable in addition enables lenders commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated enable might not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments30enable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations which could inhibit its ability to do businessperformance of enables operations require that enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate all of these permits licenses approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit license approval limit or standard noncompliance or incomplete documentation of enables compliance status may result in the imposition of fines penalties and injunctive relief a decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval could adversely affect enables ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition results of operations and cash flowsadditionally in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processingrelated activities may have on the environment individually or in the aggregate including on public and indian lands certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizationscosts of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributionsenable is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management wildlife conservation natural resources and health and safety that could among other things delay or increase its costs of construction restrict or limit the output of certain facilities andor require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the futurethere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in enables operations due to its handling of natural gas ngls crude oil produced water and air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices these activities are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants wildlife and natural and cultural resources these laws and regulations can restrict or impact enables business activities in many ways such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on under or from enables properties and facilities many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years oftentimes by third parties not under its control private parties including the owners of the properties through which enables gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage for example an accidental release from one of enables pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance moreover the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary further stricter requirements could negatively impact enables customers production and operations resulting in less demand for its servicesincreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by enables customers which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributionshydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of enables customers to stimulate production of natural gas andor oil from dense subsurface rock formations the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production many of enables customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions in addition certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process for example in september 2015 the epa published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing 31process some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely other governmental agencies including the doe and the epa have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing such as the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwaterif new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for enables services to those customersenables operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local regulatory authorities changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on enables results of operations and ability to make cash distributionsthe rates charged by several of enables pipeline systems including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines are regulated by the ferc enables pipeline operations that are not regulated by the ferc may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services the relevant states in which enable operates include north dakota oklahoma arkansas louisiana texas missouri kansas mississippi tennessee and illinoisthe ferc and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services enable may offer if one of these regulatory agencies on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service enable might propose or offer the profitability of enables pipeline businesses could suffer if enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect which could also limit its profitability furthermore competition from other pipeline systems may prevent enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so the regulatory agencies that regulate enables systems periodically implement new rules regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for enables services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributionsa change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of enables assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increaseenables natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga but ferc regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses the fercs policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets in recent years the ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines however we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to all of enables facilities it considers to be gathering facilities enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables financial condition results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or the ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the ferc32natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore enables natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changesenable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairsthe dot has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm the regulations require operators including enable to among other thingsdevelop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area improve data collection integration and analysis repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and implement preventive and mitigating action although many of enables pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair remediation preventive or mitigation measures associated with its nonexempt pipelines should enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines also the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the future such future requirements could adversely affect

uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into

respect to those claimsin connection with the organization and capitalization of texas genco now an affiliate of nrg reliant energy and texas genco entered into a separation agreement in which texas genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets reliant energy transferred to it texas genco also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses in many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of centerpoint houston and centerpoint houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities the indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on texas genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of texas genco regardless of the time those liabilities arose if texas genco were unable to satisfy a liability that had 35been so assumed or indemnified against and provided we or reliant energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer centerpoint houston could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityin connection with our sale of texas genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that texas genco would no longer be liable for and we would assume and agree to indemnify texas genco against liabilities that texas genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by uswe or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of nrg ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliatecyberattacks physical security breaches acts of

information maintained in the normal course of business the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also

transition and retain key personnel the inability to recruit and retain or effectively transition key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition because of the reliance on our management team our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management the retention of key personnel and appropriate senior management succession planning will continue to be critically important to the successful implementation of our strategiesfailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could adversely impact our results of operationsour business is dependent on our ability to recruit retain and motivate employees certain circumstances such as an aging workforce without appropriate replacements a mismatch of existing skillsets to future needs or the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges such as a lack of resources loss of knowledge or a lengthy time period associated with skill development our costs including costs to replace employees productivity costs and safety costs may rise failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business if we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce our results of operations could be negatively affectedclimate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services or enables services regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation including the modification of existing laws and regulations to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources the epa has also expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa as a distributor and transporter of natural gas or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs or enables revenues operating costs and capital requirements as applicable could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our servicesclimate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and enables gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many 37of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedaging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial resultscenterpoint energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expenses the operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees  several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions there are seven separate bargaining units in centerpoint energy each with a unique collective bargaining agreement the collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers local 66 and the two collective bargaining agreements with professional employees international union local 12 are scheduled to expire in march and may of 2016 two additional collective bargaining agreements will be renegotiated in 2017 any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flowsour businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological changewe operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection processing systems software and other technology some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly we expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide costeffective and reliable methods of energy delivery our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes in a costeffective manner and to offer on a timely basis reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards if we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change our businesses operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affectedour or enables merger and acquisition activities may not be successful or may result in completed acquisitions that do not perform as anticipatedfrom time to time we and enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions of businesses and assets however suitable acquisition candidates may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or enable as the case may be find acceptable in addition any completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks including the followingacquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues earnings or cash flow at anticipated levelsacquired businesses or assets could have environmental permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate we or enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited we or enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems and 38acquisitions or the pursuit of acquisitions could disrupt ongoing businesses distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards controls and procedures our business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholders  publicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company it is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business instability or lack of continuity this may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel we are involved in numerous legal proceedings the outcome of which are uncertain and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial resultswe are subject to numerous legal proceedings the most significant of which are summarized in note14 of the consolidated financial statements litigation is subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial resultswe are exposed to risks related to unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories our businesses are affected by the economic climate in our service territories which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth or result in reduced energy consumption by our customers some economic sectors important to our customer base may be affected for example our business is largely concentrated in houston texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 the rate of growth in employment in houston has declined in the event economic conditions further decline the rate of growth in houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial conditionour businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employees we are committed to living our core values of safety integrity accountability initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct fail to uphold our core values and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud misappropriation bribery or corruption fraudulent relatedparty transactions and serious breaches of our ethics and compliance code and standards of conductbusiness ethics policy among other policies if such intentional misconduct by employees should
