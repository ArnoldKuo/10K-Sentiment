associated with the operations of enable and a 2505 interest in sesh currently owned by cercother operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our businesses  we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis the houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011 in 2012 we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months however every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record in 2013 we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers in recent years customers have typically reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies resume typical growth the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or var to avoid significant financial exposures lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013 2012 and 2011 adversely affected results for this business segmentthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of 42debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt we expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately 87 million in 2014 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our gas operations in texas factors influencing our midstream investments segmentthe results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity because the production rate of a natural gas well declines over time producers willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas and ngls the cost to drill and operate a well the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with longterm trends in commodity prices similarly production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity to maintain and increase gathering throughput volumes on its systems enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers and marketers enables transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price to maintain and increase enables transportation and storage volumes it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers marketers ldcs power generators and endusers enables operation and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses lease costs utility costs insurance premiums and repairs and maintenance expenses these expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses the current high levels of crude oil exploration development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment this increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices enable pays for labor supplies and miscellaneous equipment to the extent enable is unable to procure necessary services or offset higher costs its operating results will be negatively affected our midstream investments segment currently includes a 2505 interest in sesh owned by cerc that may be contributed by cerc to enable in the future upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which cerc would contribute to enable cercs retained interest in sesh at a price equal to the fair market value of such interest at the time the put right or call right is exercised which may be no earlier than may 2014 and may 2015 for a 2495 and a 01 interest respectively if cerc were to exercise such put right or enable were to exercise such call right cercs retained interest in sesh would be contributed to enable in exchange for consideration consisting of a certain

support provider for ces fall below certain levels ces would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit we estimate that as of december 31 2013 unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate 308 million and 1 million of such amount was utilizedpipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shippers guarantor drop below a threshold level which is generally investment grade ratings from both moodys and sampp cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper if the credit ratings of cerc corp decline below the applicable threshold levels cerc corp might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as 180 million as of december 31 2013 the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levelsin september 1999 we issued zeropremium exchangeable subordinated notes due 2029 zens having an original principal amount of 10 billion of which 828 million remains outstanding at december 31 2013 each zens note was originally exchangeable at the holders option at any time for an amount of cash equal to 95 of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to such note the number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each zens note are adjusted for certain corporate events as of december 31 2013 the reference shares for each zens note consisted of 05 share of tw common 0125505 share of time warner cable inc twc common stock twc common and 0045455 share of aol inc common stock aol common on february 13 2014 twc announced that it had agreed to merge with comcast corporation comcast in the merger each share of twc common would be exchanged for 2875 shares of comcast common stock comcast common upon the closing of the merger assuming no change in the merger consideration the reference shares for each zens note would include 0360827 share of comcast common in place of the current 0125505 share of twc common if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common twc common and aol common that we own or from other sources we own shares of tw common twc common and aol common equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals 61related to the zens notes and tw common twc common and aol common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common twc common and aol common shares are sold the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december 31 2013 deferred taxes of

to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices and weather on our operating results and cash flows in addition enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk following enactment of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act doddfrank in july 2010 the commodity futures trading commission cftc has promulgated regulations to implement doddfranks changes to the commodity exchange act including the definition of commoditybased swaps subject to those regulations the cftc regulations are intended to implement new reporting and record keeping requirements related to their swap transactions and a mandatory clearing and exchangeexecution regime for various types categories or classes of swaps subject to certain exemptions including the tradeoption and enduser exemptions although we anticipate that most if not all of our swap transactions should qualify for an exemption to the clearing and exchangeexecution requirements we will still be subject to record keeping and reporting requirements other changes to the commodity exchange act made as a result of doddfrank and the cftcs implementing regulations could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swapscollection of receivables from repscenterpoint houstons receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows in the event of a reps default centerpoint houstons tariff provides a number of remedies including the option of centerpoint houston to request that the texas utility commission suspend or revoke the certification of the rep applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments however centerpoint houston remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against centerpoint houston involving payments it had received from such rep if a rep were to file for bankruptcy centerpoint houston may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy however texas utility commission regulations authorize utilities such as cehe to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity other factors that could affect cash

exceptionscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31 2013 we had recorded regulatory assets of 37 billion and regulatory liabilities of 12 billion64impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investmentswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of longlived assets including intangibles goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge we recorded goodwill impairment of 0 252 million and 0 during 2013 2012 and 2011 we did not record material impairments to longlived assets including intangibles or equity method investments during 2013 2012 and 2011we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2013 and determined based on the results of the first step using the income approach no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit our reporting units approximate our reportable segmentsfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesthe determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these assumptions we utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit the regulatory environment the fair value of our natural gas distribution and energy services reporting units exceeded the carrying value by approximately 23 billion and 259 million respectively or approximately 80 and 50 excess fair value over the carrying values for each reporting unit respectively a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 51 and 60 applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services respectively although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2013 annual test an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2013 annual testunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings at the end of each month deliveries to nonams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data daily supply volumes and applicable rates unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates65pension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 83 million 73 million and 35 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we made contributions of 83 million 73 million and 65 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 for the respective years we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 87 million in 2014 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 8 million 9 million and 10 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets as of december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 350 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2014 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 72 million 82 million and 78 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively of which 64 million 67 million and 49 million impacted pretax earnings  the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2013 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 700 which is a 100 decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31 2012 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation the expected rate of return assumption was developed by a weightedaverage return analysis of the targeted asset allocation for centerpoint energys plans and the expected real return for each asset class based on the long66term capital market assumptions adjusted for investment fees and diversification effects in addition to expected inflation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities as of december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 480 which is a 080 increase from the 400 discount rate assumed in 2012 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2014 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 71 million of which we expect 63 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 700 and a discount rate of 480 as of december 31 2013 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 700 to 650 2014 pension cost would increase by approximately 9 million  as of december 31 2013 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 350 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 480 to 430 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2014 pension expense by approximately 103 million and 5 million respectively in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2013 by 84 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2013 of 12 million net of tax future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be
