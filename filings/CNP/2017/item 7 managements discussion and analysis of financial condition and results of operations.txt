the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereinoverviewbackgroundwe are a public utility holding company our operating subsidiaries own and operate electric transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution facilities supply natural gas to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities and own interests in enable as described below our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries includehouston electric which engages in the electric transmission and distribution business in the texas gulf coast area that includes the city of houston cerc corp which owns and operates natural gas distribution systems in six states andces which obtains and offers competitive variable and fixedprice physical natural gas supplies and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities in 31 states as of december 31 2016 we also owned an aggregate of 14520000 series a preferred units in enable which owns operates and develops natural gas and crude oil infrastructure assets and cerc corp owned approximately 541 of the limited partner interests in enablebusiness segmentsin this managements discussion and analysis we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments we also discuss our liquidity capital resources and critical accounting policies we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on these segments of the energy business the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather customer growth economic conditions cost management competition rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission amp distribution business segment as are impacts of generationrelated stranded costs and other trueup balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility for further information about our electric transmission amp distribution business segment see business  our business  electric transmission amp distribution in item 1 of part i of this report our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment for further information about our natural gas distribution business segment see business  our business  natural gas distribution in item 1 of part i of this report our energy services business segment includes nonrate regulated natural gas sales to and transportation and storage services for commercial and industrial customers for further information about our energy services business segment see business  our business  energy services in item 1 of part i of this report the results of our midstream investments business segment are dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas ngls and crude oil that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems and other factors as discussed below under  factors influencing our midstream investments segment our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our businesses and industry trends we expect our and enables businesses to continue to be affected by the key factors and trends discussed below our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect our actual results may vary materially from our expected results we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense 43interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer for example our electric business is largely concentrated in houston texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country although houston texas has a diverse economy employment in the energy industry remains important to the extent population growth is affected by lower energy prices and there is financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry there may be an impact on the growth rate of our customer base and overall demand given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 the rate of growth in employment in houston which had been greater than the national average has declined and is now more in line with the national average we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our services reviewing recent years yearoveryear meter growth for houston electric hit a high in 2014 at 24 this growth slowed to 21 for 2015 largely as a result of the performance of the energy sector with some stabilization of the energy section in 2016 houston electric meter growth experienced an uptick to 23 we anticipate that this growth will continue at roughly 2 in line with recent yearsperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis in 2016 our houston service area experienced above normal warmth with episodes of flooding houstons average temperature of 714 degrees fahrenheit was the seventh highest record 2012 going back to 1889 in 2015 our houston service area experienced some of the mildest temperatures on record during november and december every state in which we distribute natural gas had a warmer than normal winter in 2016 and 2015 both the tdu and ngd have utilized weather hedges in the past to help reduce the impact of mild weather on its financial results however only the tdu entered a weather hedge for the 20152016 and 20162017 heating seasons ngd did not enter a weather hedge for the last two winter seasons as a result of ngds minnesota division implementing a full decoupling pilot in july 2015 we also have various rate mechanisms in place that help to mitigate the impact of abnormal weather on our financial results our longterm national trends indicate customers have reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in minnesota and arkansas rate adjustment mechanisms counter the impact of declining usage from energy efficiency improvements in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and minnesota we have benefited from growth in the number of customers this growth also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies continue to grow the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and natural gas distribution ratesour energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers primarily in the central united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to mitigate the effects of price movements it does not enter into risk management contracts for speculative purposes and maintains a low var to avoid significant financial exposures in 2016 ces acquired continuum which included approximately 13000 customers and 175 bcf of gas sales the customer base was comprised of a mix similar to our existing business this acquisition helped drive the overall operating income increase for energy services in 2016 as compared to 2015 excluding marktomarket accounting for derivatives in 2015 and 2014 energy services exhibited strong commercial and industrial customer results while capitalizing on asset optimization opportunities created by basis volatility extreme cold weather in 2014 also increased throughput and margin from our weather sensitive customers in january 2017 ces acquired aem for more information regarding this acquisition see note 19 to our consolidated financial statementsthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt 44the regulation of natural gas pipelines and related facilities by federal and state regulatory agencies affects our business in accordance with natural gas pipeline safety and integrity regulations we are making and will continue to make significant capital investments in our service territories which are necessary to help operate and maintain a safe reliable and growing natural gas system our compliance expenses may also increase as a result of preventative measures required under these regulations consequently new rates in the areas we serve are necessary to recover these increasing costswe expect to make contributions to our pension plans aggregating approximately 46 million in 2017 but may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and natural gas distribution business segment in texas factors influencing our midstream investments segmentthe results of our midstream investments segment are dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas ngls and crude oil that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems these volumes depend significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to enables systems across a number of us midcontinent markets aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of oil and gas drilling and completion activities production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity because the production rate of oil and gas wells declines over timeenable expects its business to continue to be impacted by the trends affecting the midstream industry discussed below enables outlook is based on its managements assumptions regarding the impact of these trends that it has developed by interpreting the information currently available to them if enable managements assumptions or interpretation of available information prove to be incorrect enables future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from its expectationsenables business is impacted by commodity prices which have declined and otherwise experienced significant volatility in recent years in early 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016 if current commodity prices levels persist or if commodity price levels decline enables future volumes and cash flows may be negatively impacted commodity prices impact the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil in the areas served by enables systems and the volumes on enables systems are negatively impacted if producers decrease drilling and production in those areas served both enables gathering and processing segment and its transportation and storage segment can be impacted by drilling and production enables gathering and processing segment primarily serves producers and many producers utilize the services provided by its transportation and storage segment a decrease in volumes will decrease cash flows from enables systems in addition enables processing arrangements expose it to commodity price fluctuations enable has attempted to mitigate the impact of commodity prices on its business by entering into hedges focusing on contracting feebased business and converting existing commoditybased contracts to feebased contracts despite recent low commodity prices enables longterm view is that natural gas and crude oil production in the us will increase over the past several years there has been a fundamental shift in us natural gas and crude oil production towards tight gas formations and shale plays advancements in technology have allowed producers to efficiently extract natural gas and crude oil from these formations and plays as a result the proven reserves of natural gas and crude oil in the us have significantly increased and the price of natural gas and crude oil has decreased compared to historical periodsnatural gas continues to be a critical component of energy demand in the us over the long term enables management believes that the prospects for continued natural gas demand are favorable and will be driven by population and economic growth as well as the continued displacement of coalfired power plants by natural gasfired power plants due to the price of natural gas and stricter government environmental regulations on the mining and burning of coal the eia projects that the majority of domestic consumption growth will be in the electric power industrial and liquefaction for export sectors where the aggregate natural gas demand of these sectors is expected to grow from approximately 178 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in 2016 to approximately 210 trillion cubic feet of natural in 2040 enables management believes that increasing consumption of natural gas over the long term in these sectors will continue to drive demand for enables natural gas gathering processing transportation and storage servicesenable may access the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility in addition because enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of enables common units to investors further fluctuations in energy and commodity prices can create volatility in enables common unit prices which could impact investor appetite for its common units volatility in energy and commodity prices as well as other macroeconomic factors could impact the relative 45attractiveness of enables debt securities to investors as a result of capital market volatility enable may be unable to issue equity securities or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitionsthe regulation of gathering and transmission pipelines storage and related facilities by ferc and other federal and state regulatory agencies including the dot has a significant impact on enables business for example the dots phmsa has established pipeline integrity management programs that require more frequent inspections of pipeline facilities and other preventative measures which may increase its compliance costs and increase the time it takes to obtain required permits additionally increased regulation of oil and natural gas producers including regulation associated with hydraulic fracturing could reduce regional supply of oil and natural gas and therefore throughput on enables gathering systems enable relies on certain key natural gas producer customers for a significant portion of its natural gas and ngls supply for the year ended

houston electric or cerc corp had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at december 31 2016 the impact on the borrowing costs under the three revolving credit facilities would have been immaterial a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on longterm debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market additionally a decline in credit ratings could increase cash collateral requirements and reduce earnings of our natural gas distribution and energy services business segmentsces a whollyowned subsidiary of cerc corp operating in our energy services business segment provides natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and natural gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry including those pertaining to credit thresholds typically the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold ces is not obligated to provide collateral mark61tomarket exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces similarly marktomarket exposure offsetting and exceeding the credit threshold may cause the counterparty to provide collateral to ces as of december 31 2016 the amount held by ces as collateral aggregated approximately 14 million should the credit ratings of cerc corp as the credit support provider for ces fall below certain levels ces would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit we estimate that as of december 31 2016 unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregated 367 million and less than 1 million of such amount was utilizedpipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shippers guarantor drop below a threshold level which is generally investment grade ratings from both moodys and sampp cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper if the credit ratings of cerc corp decline below the applicable threshold levels cerc corp might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as 167 million as of december 31 2016 the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levelszens and securities related to zensif our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens were to become illiquid some zens holders might decide to exchange their zens for cash funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw securities that we own or from other sources we own shares of tw securities equal to approximately 100 of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens zens exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens and tw securities shares would typically cease when zens are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw securities shares are sold the ultimate tax liability related to the zens continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens if all zens had been exchanged for cash on december 31 2016 deferred taxes of approximately 459 million would have been payable in 2016 if all the tw

collected from reps that supply the electricity houston electric distributes to their customers adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for houston electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments houston electric depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis and any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect houston electrics cash flows in the event of a reps default houston electrics tariff provides a number of remedies including the option for houston electric to request that the puct suspend or revoke the certification of the rep applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments however houston electric remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to the replacement rep or the provider of last resort if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made against houston electric involving payments it had received from such rep if a rep were to file for bankruptcy houston electric may not be successful in recovering accrued receivables owed by such rep that are unpaid as of the date the rep filed for bankruptcy however puct regulations authorize utilities such as cehe to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in future rate cases subject to a review of reasonableness and necessity other factors that could affect cash requirementsin addition to the above factors our liquidity and capital resources could be affected bycash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts including our weather hedging arrangements and gas purchases gas

covenants in our revolving credit facilities see note 13 to our consolidated financial statementscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016 we had recorded regulatory assets of 27 billion and regulatory liabilities of 13 billionimpairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investmentswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of longlived assets including intangibles goodwill and equity 64method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary we recorded no goodwill impairments during 2016 2015 and 2014 we did not record material impairments to longlived assets including intangibles during 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded impairments totaling 1225 million to our equity method investments during 2015 and no impairment during 2016 and 2014 see notes 9 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairments recorded to our equity method investment in 2015we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2016 and determined based on the results of the first step using the income approach no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit our reporting units approximate our reportable segmentsfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesthe determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these assumptions we utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit the regulatory environment the fair values of our natural gas distribution and energy services reporting units significantly exceeded the carrying values although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2016 annual test an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2016 annual testduring the year ended december 31 2015 we determined that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our investment in enable had occurred the impairment analysis compared the estimated fair value of our investment in enable to its carrying value the fair value of the investment was determined using multiple valuation methodologies under both the market and income approacheskey assumptions in the market approach include recent market transactions of comparable companies and ebitda to total enterprise multiples for comparable companies due to volatility of the quoted price of enables common units a volume weighted average price was used under the market approach to best approximate fair value at the measurement date key assumptions in the income approach include enables forecasted cash distributions projected cash flows of incentive distribution rights forecasted growth rate of enables cash distributions beyond 2020 and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash flows a weighing of the different approaches was utilized to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in enableas a result of the analysis we recorded other than temporary impairments on our equity method investment in enable of 1225 million during the year ended december 31 2015 we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections it is reasonably possible that the estimate of the impairment of our equity method investment in enable will change in the near term due to the following actual enable cash distribution is materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in enables operating environment increase in the discount rate and changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forwardlooking in nature unbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings at the end of each month deliveries to nonams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data daily supply volumes and applicable rates unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are 65determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimatespension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements  incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 7b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 0 0 and 87 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we made contributions of 0 35 million and 87 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 for the respective years we are expected to make contributions aggregating approximately 39 million in 2017 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 9 million 31 million and 10 million in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 7 million in 2017 changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assetsthe projected benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was 2197 million and 2193 million as of december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively as of december 31 2016 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 541 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2017 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 102 million 90 million and 77 million for 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively of which 67 million 59 million and 71 million impacted pretax earnings respectively included in the 2015 and 2014 pension costs were a 10 million settlement charge and a 6 million curtailment loss respectively as discussed below 66a onetime noncash settlement charge is required when lump sum distributions or other settlements of plan benefit obligations during the year exceed the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic cost for the year due to the amount of lump sum payment distributions from the nonqualified pension plan during the year ended december 31 2015 centerpoint energy recognized a noncash settlement charge of 10 million this charge is an acceleration of costs that would otherwise be recognized in future periods the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2016 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 60 which is a 025 decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31 2015 due to lower expected capital market return rates the expected rate of return assumption was developed using the targeted asset allocation of our plans and the expected return for each asset class we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities as of december 31 2016 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 415 which is 025 lower than the 440 discount rate assumed as of december 31 2015 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2017 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 95 million of which we expect approximately65 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 60 and a discount rate of 415 as of december 31 2016 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 600 to 550 2017 pension cost would increase by approximately 8 million  as of december 31 2016 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 541 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 415 to 365 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately 120 million and decrease our 2017 pension expense by approximately 2 million the expected reduction in pension expense due to the decrease in discount rate is a result of the expected correlation between the reduced interest rate and appreciation of fixed income assets in pension plans with significantly more fixed income instruments than equity instruments in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2016 by 106 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2016 of 9 million net of tax  future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future
