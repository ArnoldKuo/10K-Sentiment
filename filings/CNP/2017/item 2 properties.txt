within the state of texas neither houston electric nor any other subsidiary of centerpoint energy makes direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or owns or operates any electric generating facilities1 electric transmission on behalf of reps houston electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts in locations throughout houston electrics certificated service territory houston electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the puct electric distribution in ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps houston electric delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer houston electrics distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders houston electrics operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations houston electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the puct puct rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the puct ercot market framework houston electric is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as houston electric are regulated by the puct ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of over 78000 megawatts as of december 31 2016 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the nerc and approved by the ferc within ercot these reliability standards are administered by the tre the puct has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers  houston electrics electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area houston electric participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid restructuring of the texas electric market in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the puct either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff houston electrics integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties ultimately houston electric was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of houston electric the transition bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in houston electrics service territory as of december 31 2016 approximately 19 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstanding2customers houston electric serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2016 houston electrics customers consisted of approximately 64 reps which sell electricity to more than 24 million metered customers in houston electrics certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside houston electrics certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the puct sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg represented approximately 34 35 and 37 of houston electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings represented approximately 11 10 and 10 of houston electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively houston electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2016 was 193 million approximately 33 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively houston electric does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day ams  in may 2012 houston electric substantially completed the deployment of an ams having installed approximately 22 million smart meters to recover the cost of the ams the puct approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years and later reduced to six years as a result of doe grant funds the surcharge expired in 2015 and 2016 for residential customers and certain nonresidential customers respectively and is set to expire in 2017 for the remaining nonresidential customers the surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in houston electrics service area for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in houston electrics territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the puct and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in houston electrics service area at this time distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for houston electrics electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of houston electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that rep thus houston electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months properties all of houston electrics properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of houston electrics transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law all real and tangible properties of houston electric subject to certain exclusions are currently subject to the lien of a mortgage and deed of trust the mortgage dated november 1 1944 as supplemented and the lien of a general mortgage the general mortgage dated october 10 2002 as supplemented which is junior to the lien of the mortgage as of december 31 2016 houston electric had

ngds natural gas supply requirements ngd transports its natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms including extensions varying from one to fifteen years ngd anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration ngd actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities these price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion the regulations of the states in which ngd operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually the changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies ngd uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather ngd may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored lng and propaneair plant production ngd owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 bcf it has a working capacity of 20 bcf available for use during the

ongoing basis ngd enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors ngd has had amas associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally amas are contracts between ngd and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements ngd agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for ngd and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for ngd ngd is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization ngd has an obligation to purchase its

service lines metering and regulating equipment located on customers premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance with a few exceptions the measuring stations at which ngd receives gas are owned operated and maintained by others and its distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment these facilities including odorizing equipment are usually located on land owned by suppliers competition ngd competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users in addition as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these

balancing arrangementsas described above ces offers its customers a variety of load following services in providing these services ces uses its customers purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases storage and transportation services to serve customers natural gas requirements as a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity ces will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers purchase commitments these supply imbalances arise each month as customers natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by ces for delivery to those customers ces processes and risk control environment are designed to measure and value imbalances on a realtime basis to ensure that ces exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum the value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate var our risk control policy which is overseen by our risk oversight committee defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits ces is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools including pipeline and storage capacity financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts to support its sales ces optimizes its use of these 6various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading the var limit within which ces currently operates a 4 million maximum set by the board of directors is consistent with ces operational objective of matching

discussion is incorporated herein by referencedepartment of transportationin december 2006 congress enacted the 2006 act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act these programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration pursuant to the 2006 act phmsa at the dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our natural gas distribution systems met this deadlinepursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 2011 in december 2011 congress passed the 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirements in 2016 the 2016 act reauthorized phmsas pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority including the ability to issue emergency orders to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of asyetincomplete phmsa actions required by the 2011 actwe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with the dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 and 2016 acts by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs in addition we

respect to all of the facilities enable considers to be gathering facilities enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations states may regulate gathering pipelines state regulation generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances antidiscrimination requirements and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operateenables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the

interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to phmsas regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines in addition several ngl pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines pursuant to various federal statutes including the ngpsa the dot through phmsa regulates

operations and the operations of enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasto comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activitiesconstruct or acquire new facilities and equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean or decommission waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locationsfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining 11future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment for example the epa has established air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities which may affect enables midstream operations these include new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and the neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas production and processing activities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonable based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changethere is increasing attention being paid in the united states and worldwide to the issue of climate change as a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of ghg on the state federal or international level some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in ghg emissions cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless houston electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution business could be adversely affected through lower gas sales on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedair emissionsour operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions 12we may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngls production processing and transportation activities under the neshaps the epa established maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule compressors and back up electrical generators used by our natural gas distribution business segment and back up electrical generators used by our electric transmission amp distribution business segment are substantially compliant with these laws and regulationswater dischargesour operations are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationcercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsfor information about preexisting environmental matters please see note 15d13employeesas of december 31 2016 we

method investments could reduce our earnings goodwill is recorded when the purchase price of a business exceeds the fair market value of the tangible and separately measurable intangible net assets accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired longlived assets including intangible assets with finite useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverablefor investments we account for under the equity or cost method the impairment test considers whether the fair value of such investment as a whole not the underlying net assets has declined and whether that decline is other than temporary for example during the year ended december 31 2015 we determined that an other than temporary decrease in the value of our equity investment in enable had occurred this determination was based on the sustained low enable common unit price and further declines in such price during the year as well as the market outlook for continued depressed crude oil and natural gas prices impacting the midstream oil and gas industry we wrote down the value of our investment in enable to its estimated fair value which resulted in impairment charges of 1225 million for the year ended december 31 2015 additionally we recorded our share 621 million of impairment charges enable recorded for goodwill and longlived assets for a total impairment charge of 1846 million if enables unit price distributions or earnings were to decline to levels below those used in our impairment tests in 2015 and that decline is deemed to be other than temporary we could determine that we are unable to recover the carrying value of our equity investment in enable considerable judgment is used in determining if an impairment loss is other than temporary and the amount of any impairment a sustained low enable common unit price could result in our recording further impairment charges in the future if we determine that an impairment is indicated we would be required to take an immediate noncash charge to earnings with a correlative effect on equity and balance sheet leverage as measured by debt to total capitalization poor investment performance of the pension plan factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities and increasing health care costs could unfavorably impact our results of operations liquidity and financial position we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities funding requirements may increase and we may be required to make unplanned contributions in the event of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability in addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial position further increasing health care costs and the effects of health care reform or any future legislative changes could also materially affect our benefit programs and costs our costs of providing employee benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us our subsidiaries or enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or enablewe and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk we our subsidiaries or enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values or ineffectiveness of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contractsrisk factors affecting our electric transmission amp distribution businessrate regulation of

those discussed below each of these rate proceedings is subject to thirdparty intervention and appeal and the timing of a general base rate proceeding may be out of houston electrics control the rates that houston electric is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time which is referred to as regulatory lagthough several interim adjustment mechanisms have been implemented to reduce the effects of regulatory lag such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to limitations that may reduce houston electrics ability to adjust rates for example the dcrf mechanism adjusts an electric utilitys rates for increases in net distributioninvested capital eg distribution plant and intangible plant and communication equipment since its last comprehensive base rate proceeding but houston electric may make a dcrf filing only once per year and up to four times between comprehensive rate proceedings the tcos mechanism allows a transmission service provider to update its wholesale transmission rates to reflect changes in transmissionrelated invested capital but is only available twice a year houston electric can make no assurance that filings for such mechanisms will result in favorable adjustments to rates further the regulatory process by which rates are determined is subject to change as a result of the legislative process or rulemaking as the case may be and may not always be available or result in rates that will produce recovery of houston electrics costs or enable houston electric to earn a reasonable return in addition changes to the interim adjustment mechanisms could result in an increase in regulatory lag or otherwise impact houston electrics ability to recover its costs in a timely manner to the extent the regulatory process does not allow houston electric to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affecteddisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt houston electrics sales of transmission and distribution serviceshouston electric transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties houston electric does not own or operate any power generation facilities if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate houston electrics sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedhouston electrics revenues and results of operations are seasonala significant portion of houston electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus houston electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months unusually mild weather in the warmer months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely extreme warm weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurringthe ams deployed throughout houston electrics service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data houston electric has deployed an ams throughout its service territory the deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to houston electric over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in reps or the connection or disconnection of electric service unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the ams including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the ams changes in technology cybersecurity issues and factors outside the control of houston electric which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse effect on houston electrics results of operations financial condition and cash flowshouston electric could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standardsthe ferc has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by houston electric and other utilities within ercot the ferc has designated the nerc as the ero to promulgate standards under ferc oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system the ferc has approved the delegation by the nerc of authority for reliability in ercot to the tre a functionally independent division of ercot compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject houston electric to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures in addition if houston electric were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties18a substantial portion of houston electrics receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect houston electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operationshouston electrics receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity houston electric distributes to their customers as of december 31 2016 houston electric did business with approximately 64 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for houston electrics services or could cause them to delay such payments houston electric depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable puct regulations significantly limit the extent to which houston electric can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and houston electric thus remains at risk for payments related to services provided prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort the puct revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case a significant portion of houston electrics billed receivables from reps are from affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings houston electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2016 was 193 million approximately 33 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively in april 2014 energy future holdings publicly disclosed that it and the substantial majority of its direct and indirect subsidiaries excluding oncor electric delivery company llc and its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect houston electrics cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments houston electric had received from such reprisk factors affecting our natural gas distribution and energy services businessesrate regulation of cercs business may delay or deny cercs ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costs cercs rates for ngd are regulated by certain municipalities in texas only and state commissions in the context of comprehensive base rate proceedings ie general rate cases based on an analysis of ngds invested capital expenses and other factors in a test year often either fully or partially historic subject to periodic review and adjustment a general rate case is also a very complex and resource intensive proceeding with a relatively long timeline for completion thus the rates that cerc is allowed to charge may not match its costs at any given time resulting in what is referred to as regulatory lag though several interim rate adjustment mechanisms have been approved by jurisdictional regulatory authorities and implemented by ngd to reduce the effects of regulatory lag such adjustment mechanisms are subject to the applicable regulatory bodys approval and are subject to certain limitations that may reduce ngds ability to adjust its rates arkansas enacted legislation in 2015 allowing public utilities to elect to have their rates regulated pursuant to a frp but such legislation provides for a utilitys base rates to be adjusted once a year in each of louisiana mississippi and oklahoma ngd makes annual filings utilizing various formula rate mechanisms that adjust rates based on a comparison of authorized return to actual return to achieve the allowed return rates in those jurisdictions additionally in minnesota the mpuc implemented a full revenue decoupling pilot program in 2015 which separates approved revenues from the amount of natural gas used by its customers the effectiveness of these filings and programs depends on the approval of the applicable state regulatory bodyin texas ngds houston south texas beaumonteast texas and texas coast divisions each submit annual grip filings to recover the incremental capital investments made in the preceding year ngd must file a general rate case no later than five years after the initial grip implementation date ngd can make no assurances that such filings will result in favorable adjustments to its rates notwithstanding the application of the rate mechanisms discussed above the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of ngds costs and enable ngd to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital additionally inherent in the regulatory process is some level of risk that jurisdictional regulatory authorities may initiate investigations of the prudence of operating expenses incurred or capital investments made by ngd and deny the full recovery of ngds cost of service or the full recovery of incurred natural gas costs in rates to the extent the regulatory process does not allow ngd to make a full and timely recovery of appropriate costs its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected19cercs natural gas distribution and energy services businesses including transportation and storage are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of cercs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cercs liquidity and results of operations and financial conditioncerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials increases in natural gas prices might affect cercs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for ngd could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cercs tariff rates in addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i decrease demand for natural gas in the areas in which cerc operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that cercs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cercs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangementsa decline in cercs credit rating could result in cerc having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gasif cercs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or to purchase natural gas if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when cerc was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedcercs revenues and results of operations are seasonala substantial portion of cercs revenues is derived from natural gas sales thus cercs revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter months unusually mild weather in the winter months could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition conversely extreme cold weather conditions could increase our results of operations in a manner that would not likely be annually recurringthe states in which cerc provides regulated local natural gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cercs ability to operatefrom time to time proposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit ratingthese regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cercs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service in addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirementscercs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas which could have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to end users in addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass cercs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by cerc as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows20risk factors affecting our interests in enable midstream partners lp we hold a substantial limited partnership interest in

subordinated units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to its general partner and its affiliates referred to as available cash the principal difference between enables common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid

dependent in part on the drilling and production decisions of othersenables businesses are dependent on the drilling and production of natural gas and crude oil enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation or the amount of natural gas ngl or crude oil reserves associated with wells connected to its systems in addition as the rate at which production from wells currently connected to its systems naturally declines over time enables gross margin associated with those wells will also decline to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants enables customers must continually obtain new natural gas ngl and crude oil supplies the primary factors affecting enables ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near its systems its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand its capacity as needed if enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on its gathering processing transportation and storage facilities will decline which could adversely affect its financial position results of

environmental or other governmental regulations including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipmentfluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas ngl and crude oil reserves drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease in general terms the prices of natural gas ngls crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond enables control because of these factors even if new natural gas ngl or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves declines in natural gas ngl or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration development and production activity and if sustained could lead to decreases in such activity in early 2016 natural gas and crude oil prices dropped to their lowest levels in over 10 years both natural gas and crude oil prices increased moderately in the second half of 2016 sustained low natural gas ngl or crude oil prices could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in enables areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems which could adversely affect enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions23in addition it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on enables gathering systems and processing plants as several of the formations in the unconventional resource plays in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins should enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith enable may reduce such capital expenditures which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time in addition to capital expenditures to support growth the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time which will reduce its distributable cash flowbecause of these and other factors even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves reductions in drilling activity would result in enables inability to maintain the current levels of

principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service enables competitors include large energy companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil than enable some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering processing transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services enable provides to its customers excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by enables interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact enables ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire in addition enables customers that are significant producers of natural gas or crude oil may develop their own gathering processing transportation and storage systems in lieu of using enables systems enables ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers further natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to end users including electricity coal and liquid fuels increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for

oklahoma enable also plans to construct natural gas gathering and compression infrastructure to support producer activitythe construction of additions or modifications to enables existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond enables control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed its estimates these projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all the construction of new pipeline gathering treating processing compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel labor shortages or weather or other delays inflation or other factors which could be material in addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner if at all or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost moreover enables revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline the construction may occur over an extended period of time and enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed in addition enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize as a result the new facilities may not be able to achieve enables expected investment return which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions24in connection with enables capital investments enable may estimate or engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas to the extent enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production as a result new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return which could adversely affect enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributions in addition the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rightsofway

a significant effect on their creditworthiness severe financial problems encountered by its customers could limit enables ability to collect amounts owed to it or to enforce performance of obligations under contractual arrangements in addition many of enables customers finance their activities through cash flow from operations the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity the combination of reduction of cash flow resulting from declines in commodity prices a reduction in borrowing bases under reservebased credit facility and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a significant reduction of its customers liquidity and limit their ability to make payment or perform on their obligations to enable furthermore some of enables customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks which increases the risk that they may default on their obligations to enable financial problems experienced by enables customers could result in the impairment of its assets reduction of its operating cash flows and may also reduce or curtail their future use of its products and services which could reduce enables revenues25enable provides certain transportation and storage services under fixedprice negotiated rate contracts that are not subject to adjustment even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts and as a result enables costs could exceed its revenues received under such contractsenable has been authorized by the ferc to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates generally negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the ferc but it is possible that costs to perform services under negotiated rate contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements if this occurs it could decrease the cash flow realized by enables systems and therefore decrease the cash it has available for distribution as of december 31 2016 approximately 54 of enables contracted firm transportation capacity and 44 of its contracted firm storage capacity was subscribed under such negotiated rate contracts these contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an

agreements its rights to participate exercise operator rights or otherwise influence or benefit from the joint venture may be adversely affected certain of enables joint venture partners may have substantially greater financial resources than enable has and enable may not be able to secure the funding necessary to participate in operations its joint venture partners propose thereby reducing its ability to benefit from the joint ventureenables ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sourcesenable expects that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders as a result enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures as a result to the extent enable is unable to finance growth externally enables cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow in addition because enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operationsto the extent enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit there are no limitations in enables partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that enable has to distribute to its unitholdersenable depends on access to the capital markets to fund its expansion capital expenditures historically unit prices of midstream master limited partnerships have experienced periods of volatility in addition because enables common units are yieldbased securities rising market interest rates could impact the relative attractiveness of its common units to investors as a result of capital market volatility enable may be unable to issue equity or debt on satisfactory terms or at all which may limit its ability to expand its operations or make future acquisitionsenables debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional

not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated paymentsenable may be unable to obtain or renew permits necessary for its operations which could inhibit its ability to do businessperformance of enables operations require that enable obtains and maintains a number of federal and state permits licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards in order to operate all of these permits licenses approval limits and standards require a significant amount of monitoring record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance with the underlying permit license approval limit or standard noncompliance or incomplete documentation of enables compliance status may result in the imposition of fines penalties and injunctive relief a decision by a government agency to deny or delay the issuance of a new or existing material permit or other approval or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or other approval could adversely affect enables ability to initiate or continue operations at the affected location or facility and on its financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributionsadditionally in order to obtain permits and renewals of permits and other approvals in the future enable may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed pipeline or processingrelated activities may have on the environment individually or in the aggregate including on public and indian lands 28certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys endangered species studies and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time required to prepare applications and to receive authorizationscosts of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributionsenable is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management wildlife conservation natural resources and health and safety that could among other things delay or increase its costs of construction restrict or limit the output of certain facilities andor require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs for instance in may 2016 the epa issued final new source performance standards governing methane emissions imposing more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions at new and modified oil and natural gas production processing storage and transmission facilities these rules have required changes to enables operations including the installation of new equipment to control emissions the epa has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests to companies with production gathering and boosting gas processing storage and transmission facilities additionally several states are pursuing similar measures to regulate emissions of methane from new and existing sources there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes rules and regulations as a result of this continued regulatory focus future federal and state regulations relating to enables gathering and processing transmission and storage operations remain a possibility and could result in increased compliance costs on its operations furthermore if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions are adopted in areas where enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which could adversely affect demand for enables services to those customersthere is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in enables operations due to its handling of natural gas ngls crude oil and produced water as well as air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices these matters are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants wildlife and natural and cultural resources these laws and regulations can restrict or impact enables business activities in many ways such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on under or from enables properties and facilities many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years oftentimes by third parties not under its control private parties including the owners of the properties through which enables gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage for example an accidental release from one of enables pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance moreover the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary further stricter requirements could negatively impact enables customers production and operations resulting in less demand for its servicesincreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by enables customers which could adversely affect its financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributionshydraulic fracturing is common practice that is used by many of enables customers to stimulate production of natural gas and crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions in addition certain federal agencies have proposed additional laws and regulations to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process for example in may 2016 the epa issued final new source performance standard requirements that impose more stringent controls on methane and volatile organic compounds emissions from oil and gas development and production operations including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity the epa also released the final results of its comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water resources in december 2016 the epa concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical 29integrity of wells the results of epas study could spur action towards federal legislation and regulation of hydraulic fracturing or similar production operations in past sessions congress has considered but not passed legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process the epa has issued the safe water drinking act permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing operations involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids in those states where the epa is the permitting authority additionally the bureau of land management issued final rules to regulate hydraulic fracturing on federal lands in march 2015 although these rules were struck down by a federal court in wyoming in june 2016 an appeal of the decision is still pending some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular in some cases banning hydraulic fracturing entirely if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for enables services to those customersstate and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity when caused by human activity such events are called induced seismicity in march 2016 the united states geological survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity including oklahoma kansas texas colorado new mexico and arkansas in light of these concerns some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity for example the occ has implemented volume reduction plans and at times required shutins for disposal wells injecting wastewater from oil and gas operations into the arbuckle formation the occ also recently released well completion seismicity guidelines for operators in the south central oklahoma oil province and the sooner trend anadarko basin canadian and kingfisher counties that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process enable cannot predict whether additional federal state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and if so what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to and litigation concerning oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for enables customers which in turn could reduce the demand for enables servicesother governmental agencies including the doe have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanismsenables operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal state and local regulatory authorities changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect enables financial position results of operations and ability to make cash distributionsthe rates charged by several of enables pipeline systems including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines are regulated by the ferc enables pipeline operations that are not regulated by the ferc may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services the relevant states in which enable operates include north dakota oklahoma arkansas louisiana texas missouri kansas mississippi tennessee and illinoisthe ferc and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services enable may offer if one of these regulatory agencies on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service enable might propose or offer the profitability of enables pipeline businesses could suffer if enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect which could also limit its profitability furthermore competition from other pipeline systems may prevent enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so the regulatory agencies that regulate enables systems periodically implement new rules regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for enables services or otherwise adversely affect its financial position results of operations and cash flows and ability to make cash distributions30a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of enables assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increaseenables natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga but ferc regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses the fercs policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets in recent years the ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines however we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to all of enables facilities it considers to be gathering facilities enable believes that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or the ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the fercnatural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore enables natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changesother risk factors affecting our businesses or our interests in

replace existing and proposed equipment andclean or decommission waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locationsfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipateour insurance coverage may not be sufficient insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe currently

companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions houston electric does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because houston electric believes it to be cost prohibitive in the future houston electric may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other

services or enables services regulatory agencies have from time to time considered adopting legislation including modification of existing laws and regulations to reduce ghgs and there continues to be a wideranging policy and regulatory debate both nationally and 34internationally regarding the potential impact of ghgs and possible means for their regulation following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources the epa has also expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa as a distributor and transporter of natural gas or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs or enables revenues operating costs and capital requirements as applicable could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless houston electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our servicesclimate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businesses to the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and enables natural gas gathering processing and transportation and crude oil gathering businesses could experience lower revenues another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedwe may be negatively impacted by changes in federal income tax policy the executive and legislative branches of the united states federal government have made public statements in support of comprehensive tax reform plans including significant changes to corporate income tax laws we are currently unable to predict whether these reform discussions will result in any significant changes to existing tax laws or if any such changes would have a cumulative positive or negative impact on us or our regulatory activities it is possible that changes in the united states federal income tax laws could have an adverse effect on our or enables results of operations financial condition and cash flows cerc and enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs the dot has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm the regulations require pipeline operators including cerc and enable to among other thingsperform ongoing assessments of pipeline integritydevelop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area improve data collection integration and analysisdevelop processes for performance management record keeping management of change and communication repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and implement preventive and mitigating action 35recent regulatory proposals from phmsa would expand the scope of its safety reporting and recordkeeping requirements for both natural gas and hazardous liquids including crude oil and ngls pipelines as well as underground natural gas storage facilities these proposals if finalized would impose additional costs on us and enablein march 2016 phmsa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking detailing proposed revisions to the safety standards applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering pipelines the proposed rules include significant modifications which if adopted will result in significant operational and integrity management changes these include requiring reconfirmation of the maximum allowable operating pressures in pipelines without reliable records creating new material verification procedures adding a new moderate consequence area and tightening repair criteria for pipelines in both high and moderate consequence areas other modifications include adding recordkeeping and data collection obligations and new requirements for monitoring gas quality and managing corrosion the proposed rules also would expand the scope of gas gathering lines subject to phmsa regulation including imposing minimum safety standards on certain larger currently exempt gathering lines while subjecting all gatheringline operators to recordkeeping and annual reporting requirements from which they are currently exempt other proposed changes such as the modification to the definition of a transmission line some recordkeeping requirements and some material verification obligations also may impact distribution pipelines although phmsa states that such farreaching applicability is not its intent phmsa is currently reviewing thousands of public comments submitted in july 2016 because the impact of these proposed rules remains uncertain we are still monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on operationsphmsa also issued a similar notice of proposed rulemaking for hazardous liquid pipelines in october 2015 both of these notices of proposed rulemaking would require inspections of pipeline areas affected by severe weather natural disasters or similar events in addition the proposed hazardous liquid rule would extend phmsa reporting requirements to all gathering lines require periodic inline inspections of pipelines outside of high consequence areas require use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines modify applicable repair criteria and set a timeline for pipelines subject to integrity management requirements to be capable of accommodating inline inspection tools phmsa issued the final rule for hazardous liquid pipelines on january 13 2017 but the rules eventual implementation and effectiveness are uncertain as a result of a january 20 2017 regulatory freeze we will continue to monitor the status of this rulemaking and the effect of these proposed requirements on operationson december 14 2016 phmsa announced an interim final rule to impose industrydeveloped recommendations as enforceable safety standards for downhole underground equipment including wells wellbore tubing and casing at both interstate and intrastate underground natural gas storage facilities this rule went into effect on january 18 2017 with a compliance deadline of january 18 2018 both cerc and enable own and operate underground storage facilities that will be subject to this rules provisions which include procedures and practices for operations maintenance threat identification monitoring assessment site security emergency response and preparedness training and recordkeeping states may also impose more stringent standards on intrastate storage facilities cerc and enable continue to assess the potential impact of this newly announced rulealthough many of cercs and enables pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to the requirements in phmsas recent proposals they may nonetheless incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair remediation prevention or mitigation measures associated with their nonexempt pipelines which are subject to existing requirements work associated with phmsa requirements is part of cercs and enables normal integrity management program and neither expect to incur any extraordinary costs during 2017 to complete the testing required by existing dot regulations and their state counterparts cerc and enable have not estimated the costs for any repair remediation preventive or mitigation actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program which could be substantial or any lost cash flows resulting from shutting down their pipelines during the pendency of such repairs should cerc or enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations they could be subject to penalties and fines aging infrastructure may lead to increased costs and disruptions in operations that could negatively impact our financial resultscenterpoint energy has risks associated with aging infrastructure assets the age of certain of our assets may result in a need for replacement or higher level of maintenance costs as a result of our risk based federal and state compliant integrity management programs failure to achieve timely recovery of these expenses could adversely impact revenues and could result in increased capital expenditures or expensesthe operation of our facilities depends on good labor relations with our employees several of our businesses have entered into and have in place collective bargaining agreements with different labor unions there are seven separate bargaining units in centerpoint energy each with a unique collective bargaining agreement in 2016 houston electric entered into a renegotiated collective bargaining agreement with the ibew local 66 which is scheduled to expire in 2020 and cerc entered into two renegotiated collective bargaining agreements with professional employees 36international union local 12 which are scheduled to expire in 2021 two collective bargaining agreements with united steelworkers local 227 and united steelworkers local 131 are scheduled to expire in june and july of 2017 respectively the collective bargaining agreements with gas workers union local 340 and the ibew local 949 are scheduled to expire in april and december of 2020 respectively any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to negotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes boycotts or other labor disruptions these potential labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flows labor disruptions strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases whether due to union activities employee turnover or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on our businesses results of operations andor cash flowsour businesses will continue to have to adapt to technological change and may not be successful or may have to incur significant expenditures to adapt to technological change we operate in businesses that require sophisticated data collection processing systems software and other technology some of the technologies supporting the industries we serve are changing rapidly we expect that new technologies will emerge or grow that may be superior to or may not be compatible with some of our existing technologies and may require us to make significant expenditures so that we can continue to provide costeffective and reliable methods of energy delivery among such technological advances are distributed generation resources eg rooftop solar energy storage devices and more energyefficient buildings and products designed to reduce consumption as these technologies become a more costcompetitive option over time certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and adapt to these technological changes in a costeffective manner and to offer on a timely basis reliable services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards if we fail to adapt successfully to any technological change or obsolescence or fail to obtain access to important technologies or incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological change our businesses operating results financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affectedour or enables potential business strategies and strategic initiatives including merger and acquisition activities and the disposition of assets or businesses may not be completed or perform as expectedfrom time to time we and enable have made and may continue to make acquisitions or divestitures of businesses and assets form joint ventures or undertake restructurings however suitable acquisition candidates or potential buyers may not continue to be available on terms and conditions we or enable as the case may be find acceptable or the expected benefits of completed acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may not be realized in the anticipated timeframe if we or enable are unable to make acquisitions or if those acquisitions do not perform as anticipated our and enables future growth may be adversely affectedany completed or future acquisitions involve substantial risks including the followingacquired businesses or assets may not produce revenues earnings or cash flow at anticipated levelsacquired businesses or assets could have environmental permitting or other problems for which contractual protections prove inadequate we or enable may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us that exceed our estimates or for which our rights to indemnification from the seller are limited we or enable may be unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully and realize anticipated economic operational and other benefits in a timely manner which could result in substantial costs and delays or other operational technical or financial problems and acquisitions or the pursuit of acquisitions could disrupt ongoing businesses distract management divert resources and make it difficult to maintain current business standards controls and procedures for example the success of cercs acquisitions of continuum and aem will depend in part on its ability to realize the expected benefits including operating efficiencies cost savings and customer retention from integrating continuum and aem with its existing energy services business the integration process could be costly and time consuming and may result in the following challenges among others unanticipated disruptions issues or costs in integrating financial and accounting information technology communications and other systems 37potential inconsistencies in procedures practices policies controls and standards possible differences in compensation arrangements management perspectives and corporate culture and loss of or difficulties retaining valuable employees or thirdparty relationships even with the successful integration of the businesses cerc may not achieve the expected results cerc anticipates that its acquisitions of continuum and aem will be accretive to earnings in 2017 any of the factors addressed above could decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the transaction failure to fully realize the expected benefits could adversely affect cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows in february 2016 we announced that we were exploring the use of a reit business model for all or part of our utility businesses we have completed our evaluation and have decided not to pursue forming a reit structure for our utility business or any part thereof at this time we also announced that we were evaluating strategic alternatives for our investment in enable including a sale or spinoff qualifying under section 355 of the us internal revenue code and we continue to evaluate our alternatives including retaining our investment there can be no assurances that these evaluations will result in any specific action and we do not intend to disclose further developments on these initiatives unless and until our board of directors approves a specific action or as otherwise requiredour business could be negatively affected as a result of the actions of activist shareholderspublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by activist investors advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring increased borrowing special dividends stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company it is possible that activist shareholders may attempt to effect such changes or acquire control over us responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can be costly and timeconsuming disrupt our operations and divert the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition additionally perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism or changes to the composition of the board of directors may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business instability or lack of continuity this may be exploited by our competitors cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnelour bylaws designate the united states district court for the southern district of texas or if such court lacks jurisdiction the state district court of harris county texas as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders which could limit our shareholders flexibility in obtaining a judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employeesour bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the united states district court for the southern district of texas or if such court lacks jurisdiction the state district court of harris county texas will be the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director officer or other employee of ours to us or our shareholders iii any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other employee of ours pursuant to any provision of our articles of incorporation or bylaws as either may be amended from time to time or the texas business organizations code and iv any action asserting a claim against us or any director officer or other employee of ours governed by the internal affairs doctrine these exclusive forum provisions may limit a shareholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors officers or other employees or agents which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors officers employees or agents alternatively if a court were to find these provisions of our bylaws inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our business and financial conditionwe are involved in numerous legal proceedings the outcome of which are uncertain and resolutions adverse to us could negatively affect our financial resultswe are subject to numerous legal proceedings the most significant of which are summarized in note14 of the consolidated financial statements litigation is subject to many uncertainties and we cannot predict the outcome of individual matters with assurance final resolution of these matters may require additional expenditures over an extended period of time that may be in excess of established reserves and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results38we are exposed to risks related to reduction in energy consumption due to factors including unfavorable economic conditions in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologiesour businesses are affected by reduction in energy consumption due to factors including economic climate in our service territories energy efficiency initiatives and use of alternative technologies which could impact our ability to grow our customer base and our rate of growth declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns in our regulated electric service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows especially as industrial customers reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity although houston electric is subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs under periodic adjustment clauses overall declines in electricity sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows thereby diminishing results of operations additionally prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to writedown the carrying value of certain assets including goodwill to their respective fair valuesfor example our electric business is largely concentrated in houston texas where a higher percentage of employment is tied to the energy sector relative to other regions of the country given the significant decline in energy and commodity prices in 2015 and 2016 and resulting low commodity prices which we expect to continue in 2017 the rate of growth in employment in houston has declined in the event economic conditions further decline the rate of growth in houston and the other areas in which we operate may also deteriorate increases in customer defaults or delays in payment due to liquidity constraints could negatively impact our cash flows and financial conditiongrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and the need for additional delivery facilities customer growth and customer usage are affected by a number of factors outside our control such as mandated energy efficiency measures demandside management goals distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions such as population changes job and income growth housing starts new business formation and the overall level of economic activitycertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements andor incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates additionally technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in enduse electric devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumptionsome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may result in our failure to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on their financial position results of operations and cash flowsfurthermore we currently have energy efficiency riders in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency programs should we be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impactif we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls our ability to accurately report our financial condition results of operations or cash flows or prevent fraud may be adversely affected as a result investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting which could impact our businesses and the trading price of our securities effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company if our efforts to maintain internal controls are not successful we are unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting and processes in the future or we are unable to comply with our obligations under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our securitiesour businesses may be adversely affected by the intentional misconduct of our employeeswe are committed to living our core values of safety integrity accountability initiative and respect and complying with all applicable laws and regulations despite that commitment and our efforts to prevent misconduct it is possible for employees to engage in intentional misconduct fail to uphold our core values and violate laws and regulations for individual gain through contract or procurement fraud misappropriation bribery or corruption fraudulent relatedparty transactions and serious breaches of our ethics and compliance code and standards of conductbusiness ethics policy among other policies if such intentional misconduct by employees should occur it could result in substantial liability
