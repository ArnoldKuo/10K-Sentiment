operates wholly within the state of texas neither houston electric nor any other subsidiary of centerpoint energy makes direct retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or owns or operates any electric generating facilities1 electric transmission on behalf of reps houston electric delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts in locations throughout houston electrics certificated service territory houston electric constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the puct electric distribution in ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps houston electric delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer houston electrics distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders houston electrics operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations houston electric provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the puct puct rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the puct ercot market framework houston electric is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as houston electric are regulated by the puct ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 90 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of over 78000 megawatts as of december 31 2016 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the nerc and approved by the ferc within ercot these reliability standards are administered by the tre the puct has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers  houston electrics electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area houston electric participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid restructuring of the texas electric market in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the puct either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff houston electrics integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties ultimately houston electric was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of houston electric the transition bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in houston electrics service territory as of december 31 2016 approximately 19 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstanding2customers houston electric serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2016 houston electrics customers consisted of approximately 64 reps which sell electricity to more than 24 million metered customers in houston electrics certificated service area and municipalities electric cooperatives and other distribution companies located outside houston electrics certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the puct sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg represented approximately 34 35 and 37 of houston electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings represented approximately 11 10 and 10 of houston electrics transmission and distribution revenues in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively houston electrics aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2016 was 193 million approximately 33 and 12 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg and energy future holdings respectively houston electric does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day ams  in may 2012 houston electric substantially completed the deployment of an ams having installed approximately 22 million smart meters to recover the cost of the ams the puct approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years and later reduced to six years as a result of doe grant funds the surcharge expired in 2015 and 2016 for residential customers and certain nonresidential customers respectively and is set to expire in 2017 for the remaining nonresidential customers the surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope  competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in houston electrics service area for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in houston electrics territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the puct and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in houston electrics service area at this time distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for houston electrics electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date seasonality a significant portion of houston electrics revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of that rep thus houston electrics revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer months properties all of houston electrics properties are located in texas its properties consist primarily of highvoltage electric transmission lines and poles distribution lines substations service centers service wires and meters most of houston electrics transmission and distribution lines have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways and streets under franchise agreements and as permitted by law all real and tangible properties of houston electric subject to certain exclusions are currently subject to the lien of a mortgage and deed of trust the mortgage dated november 1 1944 as supplemented and the lien of a general mortgage the general mortgage dated october 10 2002 as supplemented which is junior to the lien of the mortgage as of december 31 2016 houston electric

ngds natural gas supply requirements ngd transports its natural gas supplies through various intrastate and interstate pipelines under contracts with remaining terms including extensions varying from one to fifteen years ngd anticipates that these gas supply and transportation contracts will be renewed or replaced prior to their expiration ngd actively engages in commodity price stabilization pursuant to annual gas supply plans presented to andor filed with each of its state regulatory authorities these price stabilization activities include use of storage gas and contractually establishing structured prices eg fixed price costless collars and caps with our physical gas suppliers its gas supply plans generally call for 5075 of winter supplies to be stabilized in some fashion the regulations of the states in which ngd operates allow it to pass through changes in the cost of natural gas including savings and costs of financial derivatives associated with the indexpriced physical supply to its customers under purchased gas adjustment provisions in its tariffs depending upon the jurisdiction the purchased gas adjustment factors are updated periodically ranging from monthly to semiannually the changes in the cost of gas billed to customers are subject to review by the applicable regulatory bodies ngd uses various thirdparty storage services or owned natural gas storage facilities to meet peakday requirements and to manage the daily changes in demand due to changes in weather ngd may also supplement contracted supplies and storage from time to time with stored lng and propaneair plant production ngd owns and operates an underground natural gas storage facility with a capacity of 70 bcf it has a working capacity of 20 bcf available for use during the

ongoing basis ngd enters into contracts to provide sufficient supplies and pipeline capacity to meet its customer requirements however it is possible for limited service disruptions to occur from time to time due to weather conditions transportation constraints and other events as a result of these factors supplies of natural gas may become unavailable from time to time or prices may increase rapidly in response to temporary supply constraints or other factors ngd has had amas associated with its utility distribution service in arkansas louisiana mississippi oklahoma and texas generally amas are contracts between ngd and an asset manager that are intended to transfer the working capital obligation and maximize the utilization of the assets in these agreements ngd agrees to release transportation and storage capacity to other parties to manage natural gas storage supply and delivery arrangements for ngd and to use the released capacity for other purposes when it is not needed for ngd ngd is compensated by the asset manager through payments made over the life of the agreements based in part on the results of the asset optimization ngd has an obligation to purchase its

of natural gas distribution mains varying in size from onehalf inch to 24 inches in diameter generally in each of the cities towns and rural areas served by ngd it owns the underground gas mains and service lines metering and regulating equipment located on customers premises and the district regulating equipment necessary for pressure maintenance with a few exceptions the measuring stations at which ngd receives gas are owned operated and maintained by others and its distribution facilities begin at the outlet of the measuring equipment these facilities including odorizing equipment are usually located on land owned by suppliers competition ngd competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other gas distributors and marketers also compete directly for gas sales to end users in addition as a result of federal regulations affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these

balancing arrangementsas described above ces offers its customers a variety of load following services in providing these services ces uses its customers purchase commitments to forecast and arrange its own supply purchases storage and transportation services to serve customers natural gas requirements as a result of the variance between this forecast activity and the actual monthly activity ces will either have too much supply or too little supply relative to its customers purchase commitments these supply imbalances arise each month as customers natural gas requirements are scheduled and corresponding natural gas supplies are nominated by ces for delivery to those customers ces processes and risk control environment are designed to measure and value imbalances on a realtime basis to ensure that ces exposure to commodity price risk is kept to a minimum the value assigned to these imbalances is calculated daily and is known as the aggregate var our risk control policy which is overseen by our risk oversight committee defines authorized and prohibited trading instruments and trading limits ces is a physical marketer of natural gas and uses a variety of tools including pipeline and storage capacity financial instruments and physical commodity purchase contracts to support its sales ces optimizes its use of these 6various tools to minimize its supply costs and does not engage in speculative commodity trading the var limit within which ces currently operates a 4 million maximum set by the board of directors is consistent with ces operational objective of matching

discussion is incorporated herein by referencedepartment of transportationin december 2006 congress enacted the 2006 act which reauthorized the programs adopted under the 2002 act these programs included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration pursuant to the 2006 act phmsa at the dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our natural gas distribution systems met this deadlinepursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 2011 in december 2011 congress passed the 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirements in 2016 the 2016 act reauthorized phmsas pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority including the ability to issue emergency orders to set inspection requirements for certain underwater pipelines and to promulgate minimum safety standards for natural gas storage facilities as well as to provide increased transparency into the status of asyetincomplete phmsa actions required by the 2011 actwe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs natural gas distribution companies and intrastate pipelines and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will continue to require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with the dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 and 2016 acts by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of existing regulations that could impact our compliance costs in addition we may be subject to the dots enforcement actions and penalties if we fail to comply with pipeline regulations9midstream investments  rate and other regulation  federal state and local regulation may

abovenatural gas gathering pipeline regulationsection 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc although the ferc has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities enable considers to be gathering facilities enable believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations states may regulate gathering pipelines state regulation generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances antidiscrimination requirements and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operateenables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes10crude oil gathering regulationenable provides interstate transportation on

may be regulated as a common carrier by the ferc under the ica the energy policy act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and ferc regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory or not conferring any undue preference upon any shipper ferc regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the ferc and publicly post tariffs

safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities all natural gas transmission facilities such as enables interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to phmsas regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines in addition several ngl pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines pursuant to various federal statutes including the ngpsa the dot through phmsa regulates pipeline safety and integrity ngl and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by phmsa under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act which requires phmsa to develop prescribe and enforce

require that enable expand its integrity management program to currently unregulated pipelines costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on its operationsenvironmental mattersour operations and the operations of enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines distribution systems and storage electric transmission and distribution systems and the facilities that support these systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasto comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activitiesconstruct or acquire new facilities and equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean or decommission waste management areas fuel storage facilities and other locationsfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining 11future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been stored disposed or released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may impact the environment for example the epa has established air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities which may affect enables midstream operations these include new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and the neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with natural gas production and processing activities there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to maintain compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonable based on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changethere is increasing attention being paid in the united states and worldwide to the issue of climate change as a result from time to time regulatory agencies have considered the modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations addressing the emissions of ghg on the state federal or international level some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in ghg emissions cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless houston electrics revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution business could be adversely affected through lower gas sales on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible result of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedair emissionsour operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions 12we may be required to obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa has established new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngls production processing and transportation activities under the neshaps the epa established maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule compressors and back up electrical generators used by our natural gas distribution business segment and back up electrical generators used by our electric transmission amp distribution business segment are substantially compliant with these laws and regulationswater dischargesour operations are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationcercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsfor information about preexisting environmental matters please see note 15d13employeesas of december 31 2016 we
