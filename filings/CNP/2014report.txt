centerpoint houston is a transmission and distribution electric utility that operates wholly within the state of texas neither centerpoint houston nor any other subsidiary of centerpoint energy makes retail or wholesale sales of electric energy or owns or operates any electric generating facilities electric transmission on behalf of retail electric providers reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations from one substation to another and to retail electric customers taking power at or above 69 kilovolts kv in locations throughout centerpoint houstons certificated service territory centerpoint houston constructs and maintains transmission facilities and provides transmission services under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commission1 electric distribution in the electric reliability council of texas inc ercot end users purchase their electricity directly from certificated reps centerpoint houston delivers electricity for reps in its certificated service area by carrying lowervoltage power from the substation to the retail electric customer centerpoint houstons distribution network receives electricity from the transmission grid through power distribution substations and delivers electricity to end users through distribution feeders centerpoint houstons operations include construction and maintenance of distribution facilities metering services outage response services and call center operations centerpoint houston provides distribution services under tariffs approved by the texas utility commission texas utility commission rules and market protocols govern the commercial operations of distribution companies and other market participants rates for these existing services are established pursuant to rate proceedings conducted before municipalities that have original jurisdiction and the texas utility commission ercot market framework centerpoint houston is a member of ercot within ercot prices for wholesale generation and retail electric sales are unregulated but services provided by transmission and distribution companies such as centerpoint houston are regulated by the texas utility commission ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in most of texas ercot membership is open to consumer groups investor and municipallyowned electric utilities rural electric cooperatives independent generators power marketers river authorities and reps the ercot market includes most of the state of texas other than a portion of the panhandle portions of the eastern part of the state bordering arkansas and louisiana and the area in and around el paso the ercot market represents approximately 85 of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nations largest power markets the ercot market included available generating capacity of over 74000 megawatts mw at december 31 2013 currently there are only limited direct current interconnections between the ercot market and other power markets in the united states and mexico the ercot market operates under the reliability standards set by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc and approved by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc these reliability standards are administered by the texas regional entity tre a functionally independent division of ercot the texas utility commission has primary jurisdiction over the ercot market to ensure the adequacy and reliability of electricity supply across the states main interconnected power transmission grid the ercot independent system operator ercot iso is responsible for operating the bulk electric power supply system in the ercot market its responsibilities include ensuring that electricity production and delivery are accurately accounted for among the generation resources and wholesale buyers and sellers unlike certain other regional power markets the ercot market is not a centrally dispatched power pool and the ercot iso does not procure energy on behalf of its members other than to maintain the reliable operations of the transmission system members who sell and purchase power are responsible for contracting sales and purchases of power bilaterally the ercot iso also serves as agent for procuring ancillary services for those members who elect not to provide their own ancillary services centerpoint houstons electric transmission business along with those of other owners of transmission facilities in texas supports the operation of the ercot iso the transmission business has planning design construction operation and maintenance responsibility for the portion of the transmission grid and for the loadserving substations it owns primarily within its certificated area centerpoint houston participates with the ercot iso and other ercot utilities to plan design obtain regulatory approval for and construct new transmission lines necessary to increase bulk power transfer capability and to remove existing constraints on the ercot transmission grid restructuring of the texas electric market in 1999 the texas legislature adopted the texas electric choice plan texas electric restructuring law pursuant to that legislation integrated electric utilities operating within ercot were required to unbundle their integrated operations into separate retail sales power generation and transmission and distribution companies the legislation provided for a transition period to move to the new market structure and provided a mechanism for the formerly integrated electric utilities to recover stranded and certain other costs resulting from the transition to competition those costs were recoverable after approval by the texas utility commission either through the issuance of securitization bonds or through the implementation of a competition transition charge as a rider to the utilitys tariff centerpoint houstons integrated utility business was restructured in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law and its generating stations were sold to third parties ultimately centerpoint houston was authorized to recover a total of approximately 5 billion in stranded costs other charges and related interest most of that amount was recovered through the issuance of transition bonds by special purpose subsidiaries of centerpoint houston the transition bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in centerpoint houstons service territory as of december 31 2013 approximately 29 billion aggregate principal amount of transition bonds were outstanding2customers centerpoint houston serves nearly all of the houstongalveston metropolitan area at december 31 2013 centerpoint houstons

other distribution companies located outside centerpoint houstons certificated service area each rep is licensed by and must meet minimum creditworthiness criteria established by the texas utility commission sales to reps that are affiliates of nrg energy inc nrg represented approximately 38 39 and 36 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively sales to reps that are affiliates of energy future holdings corp energy future holdings represented approximately 10 10 and 11 of centerpoint houstons transmission and distribution revenues in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2013 was 172 million approximately 38 8 and 8 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg just energy group inc and energy future holdings respectively centerpoint houston does not have longterm contracts with any of its customers it operates using a continuous billing cycle with meter readings being conducted and invoices being distributed to reps each business day advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid in may 2012 centerpoint houston substantially completed the deployment of an advanced metering system ams having installed approximately 22 million smart meters this technology should encourage greater energy conservation by giving houstonarea electric consumers the ability to better monitor and manage their electric use and its cost in near real time to recover the cost of the ams the texas utility commission approved a monthly surcharge payable by reps initially over 12 years for the first 24 months which began in february 2009 the surcharge for residential customers was 324 per month beginning in february 2011 the surcharge was reduced to 305 per month in september 2011 the surcharge duration was reduced from 12 years to approximately six years for residential customers and approximately eight years for commercial customers the surcharge amounts and duration are subject to adjustment in future proceedings to reflect actual costs incurred and to address required changes in scope please read   managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  regulatory matters  centerpoint houston centerpoint houston is also pursuing deployment of an electric distribution grid automation strategy that involves the implementation of an intelligent grid ig which would provide ondemand data and information about the status of facilities on its system although this technology is still in the developmental stage centerpoint houston believes it has the potential to provide an improvement in grid planning operations maintenance and customer service for the centerpoint houston distribution system these improvements are expected to result in fewer and shorter outages better customer service improved operations costs improved security and more effective use of our workforce we expect to include the costs of the deployment in future rate proceedings before the texas utility commission in october 2009 the us department of energy doe selected centerpoint houston for a 200 million grant to help fund its ams and ig projects centerpoint houston received substantially all of the 200 million of grant funding from the doe by 2011 and used 150 million of it to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to 2012 instead of 2014 as originally scheduled centerpoint houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately 660 million for the installation of the advanced meters and corresponding communication and data management systems were incurred over the advanced meter deployment period centerpoint houston is using the other 50 million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig that covers approximately 12 of its service territory this initial deployment is expected to be completed in 2014 it is expected that the capital portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe will cost approximately 140 million competition there are no other electric transmission and distribution utilities in centerpoint houstons service area in order for another provider of transmission and distribution services to provide such services in centerpoint houstons territory it would be required to obtain a certificate of convenience and necessity from the texas utility commission and depending on the location of the facilities may also be required to obtain franchises from one or more municipalities we know of no other party intending to enter this business in centerpoint houstons service area at this time distributed generation ie power generation located at or near the point of consumption could result in a reduction of demand for centerpoint houstons electric distribution services but has not been a significant factor to date 3seasonality a significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons

included several requirements related to ensuring pipeline safety and a requirement to assess the integrity of pipeline transmission facilities in areas of high population concentration pursuant to the 2006 act the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa at the department of transportation dot issued regulations effective february 12 2010 requiring operators of gas distribution pipelines to develop and implement integrity management programs similar to those required for gas transmission pipelines but tailored to reflect the differences in distribution pipelines operators of natural gas distribution systems were required to write and implement their integrity management programs by august 2 2011 our natural gas distribution systems met this deadlinepursuant to the 2002 act and the 2006 act phmsa has adopted a number of rules concerning among other things distinguishing between gathering lines and transmission facilities requiring certain design and construction features in new and replaced lines to reduce corrosion and requiring pipeline operators to amend existing written operations and maintenance procedures and operator qualification programs phmsa also updated its reporting requirements for natural gas pipelines effective january 1 2011 in december 2011 congress passed the pipeline safety regulatory certainty and job creation act of 2011 2011 act this act increases the maximum civil penalties for pipeline safety administrative enforcement actions requires the dot to study and report on the expansion of integrity management requirements and the sufficiency of existing gathering line regulations to ensure safety requires pipeline operators to verify their records on maximum allowable operating pressure and imposes new emergency response and incident notification requirementswe anticipate that compliance with phmsas regulations performance of the remediation activities by cercs natural gas distribution companies and verification of records on maximum allowable operating pressure will require increases in both capital expenditures and operating costs the level of expenditures will depend upon several factors including age location and operating pressures of the facilities in particular the cost of compliance with dots integrity management rules will depend on integrity testing and the repairs found to be necessary by such testing changes to the amount of pipe subject to integrity management whether by expansion of the definition of the type of areas subject to integrity management procedures or of the applicability of such procedures outside of those defined areas may also affect the costs we incur implementation of the 2011 act by phmsa may result in other regulations or the reinterpretation of

regulation above  natural gas gathering pipeline regulation  section 1b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc although the ferc has not made formal determinations with respect to all of the facilities enable considers to be gathering facilities it believes that its natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables results of operations and cash flows in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by the ferc  states may regulate gathering pipelines state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety environmental and in some circumstances requirements prohibiting undue discrimination and in some instances complaintbased rate regulation enables gathering operations may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the states in which they operate these statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply and have the effect of restricting enables right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport natural gas  enables gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes  crude oil gathering regulation  enable provides interstate transportation on its crude oil gathering system in north dakota pursuant to a public tariff in accordance with ferc regulatory requirements crude oil gathering pipelines that provide interstate transportation service may be regulated as a common carrier by the ferc under the interstate commerce act ica the energy policy act of 1992 and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws the ica and ferc regulations require that rates for interstate service pipelines that transport crude oil and refined petroleum products collectively referred to as petroleum pipelines and certain other liquids be just and reasonable and are to be nondiscriminatory or not confer any undue preference upon any shipper ferc regulations also require interstate common carrier petroleum pipelines to file with the ferc and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service under the ica the ferc or interested persons may challenge existing or changed rates or services the ferc is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months a successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier paying refunds together with interest for the period that the rate was in effect the ferc may also order a pipeline to change its rates and may require a common carrier to pay shippers reparations for damages sustained for a period up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint  for some time now the ferc has been issuing regulatory assurances that necessarily balance the antidiscrimination and undue preference requirements of common carriage with the expectations of investors in new and expanding petroleum pipelines there is an inherent tension between the requirements imposed upon a common carrier and the need for owners of petroleum pipelines to be able to enter into longterm firm contracts with shippers willing to make the commitments which underpin such large capital investments the fercs solution has been to allow carriers to hold an open season prior to the inservice date of pipeline during which time interested shippers can make commitments to the proposed pipeline project throughput commitments from interested shippers during an open season can be for firm service or for nonfirm service typically such an open season is for a 30day period must be publicly announced and culminates in interested parties entering into transportation agreements with the carrier under ferc precedent a carrier typically may reserve up to 90 of available capacity for the provision of firm service to shippers making a commitment at least 10 of capacity ordinarily is reserved for walkup shippers 12 midstream investments  safety and health regulation  certain of enables facilities are subject to pipeline safety regulations phmsa regulates safety requirements in the design construction operation and maintenance of jurisdictional natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities all natural gas transmission facilities such as enables interstate natural gas pipelines are subject to phmsas pipeline safety regulations but natural gas gathering pipelines are subject to the pipeline safety regulations only to the extent they are classified as regulated gathering pipelines in addition several ngl pipeline facilities and crude oil pipeline facilities are regulated as hazardous liquids pipelines pursuant to various federal statutes including the natural gas pipeline safety act of 1968 ngpsa the dot through phmsa regulates pipeline safety and integrity ngl and crude oil pipelines are subject to regulation by phmsa under the hlpsa which requires phmsa to develop prescribe

operationsenvironmental mattersour operations and the operations of enable are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas distribution systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such asrestricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to among other activitiesconstruct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operationsmodify upgrade or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment13the recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to ensure the costs of such compliance are reasonablebased on current regulatory requirements and interpretations we do not believe that compliance with federal state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations or cash flows in addition we believe that our current environmental remediation activities will not materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability we cannot assure you however that future events such as changes in existing laws the promulgation of new laws or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs the following is a discussion of all material current environmental and safety laws and regulations that relate to our operations we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulationsglobal climate changein recent years there has been increasing public debate regarding the potential impact on global climate change by various greenhouse gases ghgs such as carbon dioxide a byproduct of burning fossil fuels and methane the principal component of the natural gas that we transport and deliver to customers the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation some of the proposals would require industrial sources to meet stringent new standards that would require substantial reductions in carbon emissions in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues following a finding by the us environmental protection agency epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles beginning january 2 2011 the other regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources under the clean air acts prevention of significant deterioration and title v programs commencing when the motor vehicle standards took effect on january 2 2011 also the epa adopted its mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule that requires the annual calculation and reporting of ghg emissions from natural gas transmission gathering processing and distribution systems and electric distribution systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year these additional reporting requirements began in 2012 and we are currently in compliance these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa although the adoption of new legislation is uncertain action by the epa to impose new standards and reporting requirements regarding ghg emissions continues in addition many states and regions of the united states have begun to regulate ghgs cercs revenues operating costs and capital requirements could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our services conversely regulatory actions that effectively promote the consumption of natural gas because of its lower emissions characteristics would be expected to beneficially affect cerc and its natural gasrelated businesses at this point in time however it would be speculative to try to quantify the magnitude of the impacts from possible new regulatory actions related to ghg emissions either positive or negative on our businesses to the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and enables businesses could experience lower revenues on the other hand warmer temperatures in our electric service territory may increase our revenues from transmission and distribution through increased demand for electricity for cooling another possible effect of climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impacted14air emissionsour operations and the operations of enable are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources including processing plants and compressor stations and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements such laws and regulations may require preapproval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in the increase of existing air emissions obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations or utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties injunctions conditions or restrictions on operations and potentially criminal enforcement actions we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissionsthe epa continues to adopt amendments to its regulations regarding maximum achievable control technology for stationary internal combustion engines sometimes referred to as the rice mact rule the most recent being january 14 2013 on august 29 2013 the epa announced that it was reconsidering three issues related to the rice mact rule but the agency has not subsequently issued a rule proposal compressors and back up electrical generators used by our natural gas distribution segment are generally compliant additional rules are expected to be proposed by the epa this year for compliance by 2016 we believe however that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirementsin addition on august 16 2012 the epa published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and ngl production processing and transportation activities including new source performance standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshaps to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities the finalized regulations establish specific new requirements for emissions from compressors controllers dehydrators storage tanks gas processing plants and certain other equipment the final rules under neshaps include maximum achievable control technology standards for small glycol dehydrators that are located at major sources of hazardous air pollutants and modifications to the leak detection standards for valves compliance with such rules is not expected to result in significant costs that would adversely impact our results of operationswater dischargesour operations and the operations of enable are subject to the federal water pollution control act of 1972 as amended also known as the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations these laws and regulations impose detailed requirements and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the united states the unpermitted discharge of pollutants including discharges resulting from a spill or leak incident is prohibited the clean water act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit discharges of dredged and fill material in wetlands and other waters of the united states unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit any unpermitted release of petroleum or other pollutants from our pipelines or facilities could result in fines or penalties as well as significant remedial obligationshazardous wasteour operations and the operations of enable generate wastes including some hazardous wastes that are subject to the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws which impose detailed requirements for the handling storage treatment transport and disposal of hazardous and solid waste rcra currently exempts many natural gas gathering and field processing wastes from classification as hazardous waste specifically rcra excludes from the definition of hazardous waste waters produced and other wastes associated with the exploration development or production of crude oil and natural gas however these oil and gas exploration and production wastes are still regulated under state law and the less stringent nonhazardous waste requirements of rcra moreover ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes waste solvents laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils may be regulated as hazardous waste the transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some hazardous wastes that would be subject to rcra or comparable state law requirementsliability for remediationthe comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended cercla also known as superfund and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations such as landfills although petroleum as well as natural gas is excluded 15from cerclas definition of a hazardous substance in the course of our ordinary operations we generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance cercla authorizes the epa and in some cases third parties to take action in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur under cercla we could be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studiesliability for preexisting conditionsmanufactured gas plant sites cerc and its predecessors operated manufactured gas plants mgps in the past in minnesota cerc has completed remediation on two sites other than ongoing monitoring and water treatment there are five remaining sites in cercs minnesota service territory cerc believes that it has no liability with respect to two of these sitesas of december 31 2013 cerc had recorded a liability of 14 million for remediation of these minnesota sites the estimated range of possible remediation costs for the sites cerc believes it has responsibility for was 6 million to 41 million based on remediation continuing for 30 to 50 years the cost estimates are based on studies of a site or industry average costs for remediation of sites of similar size the actual remediation costs will be dependent upon the number of sites to be remediated the participation of other potentially responsible parties prps if any and the remediation methods used the minnesota public utilities commission includes approximately 285000 annually in rates to fund normal ongoing remediation costs as of december 31 2013 cerc had collected 63 million from insurance companies to be used for future environmental remediationin addition to the minnesota sites the epa and other regulators have investigated mgp sites that were owned or operated by cerc or may have been owned by one of its former affiliates we and cerc do not expect the ultimate outcome of these investigations will have a material adverse impact on the financial

subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as defendants in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future in 2004 we sold our generating business to which most of these claims relate to a company which is now an affiliate of nrg under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business

midstream partners lp enable a midstream partnership jointly controlled by cerc corp and oge the following along with any additional legal proceedings identified or incorporated by reference in item 3 of this report summarizes the principal risk factors associated with the businesses conducted by our subsidiaries and our interests in enable risk factors affecting our electric transmission amp distribution businessa substantial portion of centerpoint houstons receivables is concentrated in a small number of reps and any delay or default in payment could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operationscenterpoint houstons receivables from the distribution of electricity are collected from reps that supply the electricity centerpoint houston distributes to their customers as of december 31 2013 centerpoint houston did business with approximately 70 reps adverse economic conditions structural problems in the market served by ercot or financial difficulties of one or more reps could impair the ability of these reps to pay for centerpoint houstons services or could cause them to delay such payments centerpoint houston depends on these reps to remit payments on a timely basis applicable regulatory provisions require that customers be shifted to another rep or a provider of last resort if a rep cannot make timely payments applicable texas utility commission regulations significantly limit the extent to which centerpoint houston can apply normal commercial terms or otherwise seek credit protection from firms desiring to provide retail electric service in its service territory and centerpoint houston thus remains at risk for payments not made prior to the shift to another rep or the provider of last resort the texas utility commission revised its regulations in 2009 to i increase the financial qualifications required of reps that began selling power after january 1 2009 and ii authorize utilities to defer bad debts resulting from defaults by reps for recovery in a future rate case a significant portion of centerpoint houstons billed receivables from reps are from affiliates of nrg just energy group inc just energy group and energy future holdings centerpoint houstons aggregate billed receivables balance from reps as of december 31 2013 was 172 million approximately 38 8 and 8 of this amount was owed by affiliates of nrg just energy group and energy future holdings respectively in the fourth quarter of 2013 energy future holdings publicly disclosed that it had engaged in discussions with certain of its creditors with respect to the capital structure of energy future holdings and its affiliates including the possibility of a restructuring transaction in bankruptcy the disclosures do not make clear whether those discussions included or addressed the capital structure of affiliates of energy future holdings that are reps any delay or default in payment by reps could adversely affect centerpoint houstons cash flows financial condition and results of operations if a rep were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event such rep might seek to avoid honoring its obligations and claims might be made by creditors involving payments centerpoint houston had received from such rep18rate regulation of centerpoint houstons business may delay or deny centerpoint houstons ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscenterpoint houstons rates are regulated by certain municipalities and the texas utility commission based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that centerpoint houston is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process by which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of centerpoint houstons costs and enable centerpoint houston to earn a reasonable return on its invested capitaldisruptions at power generation facilities owned by third parties could interrupt centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution servicescenterpoint houston transmits and distributes to customers of reps electric power that the reps obtain from power generation facilities owned by third parties centerpoint houston does not own or operate any power generation facilities if power generation is disrupted or if power generation capacity is inadequate centerpoint houstons sales of transmission and distribution services may be diminished or interrupted and its results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedcenterpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are seasonala significant portion of centerpoint houstons revenues is derived from rates that it collects from each rep based on the amount of electricity it delivers on behalf of such rep thus centerpoint houstons revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in electricity usage with revenues generally being higher during the warmer monthscenterpoint houston could be subject to higher costs and fines or other sanctions as a result of mandatory reliability standardsthe ferc has jurisdiction with respect to ensuring the reliability of electric transmission service including transmission facilities owned by centerpoint houston and other utilities within ercot the ferc has designated the nerc as the ero to promulgate standards under ferc oversight for all owners operators and users of the bulk power system the ferc has approved the delegation by the nerc of authority for reliability in ercot to the tre a functionally independent division of ercot compliance with the mandatory reliability standards may subject centerpoint houston to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures in addition if centerpoint houston were to be found to be in noncompliance with applicable mandatory reliability standards it could be subject to sanctions including substantial monetary penalties the ams deployed throughout centerpoint houstons service territory may experience unexpected problems with respect to the timely receipt of accurate metering data centerpoint houston has deployed an ams throughout its service territory the deployment consisted among other elements of replacing existing meters with new electronic meters that record metering data at 15minute intervals and wirelessly communicate that information to centerpoint houston over a bidirectional communications system installed for that purpose the ams integrates equipment and computer software from various vendors in order to eliminate the need for physical meter readings to be taken at consumers premises such as monthly readings for billing purposes and special readings associated with a customers change in reps or the connection or disconnection of electric service unanticipated difficulties could be encountered during the operation of the ams including failures or inadequacy of equipment or software difficulties in integrating the various components of the ams changes in technology cybersecurity issues and factors outside the control of centerpoint houston which could result in delayed or inaccurate metering data that might lead to delays or inaccuracies in the calculation and imposition of delivery or other charges which could have a material adverse effect on centerpoint houstons results of operations financial condition and cash flowsrisk factors affecting our natural gas distribution and energy services businessesrate regulation of cercs business may delay or deny cercs ability to earn a reasonable return and fully recover its costscercs rates for gas operations are regulated by certain municipalities and state commissions based on an analysis of its invested capital and its expenses in a test year thus the rates that cerc is allowed to charge may not match its expenses at any given time the regulatory process in which rates are determined may not always result in rates that will produce full recovery of cercs costs and enable cerc to earn a reasonable return on its invested capital 19cercs businesses must compete with alternate energy sources which could result in cerc marketing less natural gas which could have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscerc competes primarily with alternate energy sources such as electricity and other fuel sources in some areas intrastate pipelines other natural gas distributors and marketers also compete directly with cerc for natural gas sales to endusers in addition as a result of federal regulatory changes affecting interstate pipelines natural gas marketers operating on these pipelines may be able to bypass cercs facilities and market sell andor transport natural gas directly to commercial and industrial customers any reduction in the amount of natural gas marketed sold or transported by cerc as a result of competition may have an adverse impact on cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flowscercs natural gas distribution and energy services businesses are subject to fluctuations in notional natural gas prices as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials which could affect the ability of cercs suppliers and customers to meet their obligations or otherwise adversely affect cercs liquidity and results of operations and financial condition cerc is subject to risk associated with changes in the notional price of natural gas as well as geographic and seasonal natural gas price differentials increases in natural gas prices might affect cercs ability to collect balances due from its customers and for gas operations could create the potential for uncollectible accounts expense to exceed the recoverable levels built into cercs tariff rates in addition a sustained period of high natural gas prices could i apply downward demand pressure on natural gas consumption in the areas in which cerc operates thereby resulting in decreased sales and revenues and ii increase the risk that cercs suppliers or customers fail or are unable to meet their obligations an increase in natural gas prices would also increase cercs working capital requirements by increasing the investment that must be made in order to maintain natural gas inventory levels additionally a decrease in natural gas prices could increase the amount of collateral that cerc must provide under its hedging arrangements a decline in cercs credit rating could result in cercs having to provide collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gasif cercs credit rating were to decline it might be required to post cash collateral under its shipping or hedging arrangements or in order to purchase natural gas if a credit rating downgrade and the resultant cash collateral requirement were to occur at a time when cerc was experiencing significant working capital requirements or otherwise lacked liquidity cercs results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affectedcercs revenues and results of operations are seasonala substantial portion of cercs revenues is derived from natural gas sales thus cercs revenues and results of operations are subject to seasonality weather conditions and other changes in natural gas usage with revenues being higher during the winter monthsthe states in which cerc provides regulated local gas distribution may either through legislation or rules adopt restrictions regarding organization financing and affiliate transactions that could have significant adverse impacts on cercs ability to operateproposals have been put forth in some of the states in which cerc does business to give state regulatory authorities increased jurisdiction and scrutiny over organization capital structure intracompany relationships and lines of business that could be pursued by registered holding companies and their affiliates that operate in those states some of these frameworks attempt to regulate financing activities acquisitions and divestitures and arrangements between the utilities and their affiliates and to restrict the level of nonutility business that can be conducted within the holding company structure additionally they may impose recordkeeping record access employee training and reporting requirements related to affiliate transactions and reporting in the event of certain downgrading of the utilitys credit rating these regulatory frameworks could have adverse effects on cercs ability to conduct its utility operations to finance its business and to provide costeffective utility service in addition if more than one state adopts restrictions on similar activities it may be difficult for cerc and us to comply with competing regulatory requirements20risk factors associated with our consolidated financial conditionif we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms our ability to refinance existing indebtedness could be limitedas of december 31 2013 we had 84 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis which includes 34 billion of nonrecourse transition and system restoration bonds as of december 31 2013 approximately 593 million principal amount of this debt is required to be paid through 2016 this amount excludes principal repayments of approximately 11 billion on transition and system

this report these credit ratings may not remain in effect for any given period of time and one or more of these ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy sell or hold our securities each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to access capital on acceptable termsas a holding company with no operations of our own we will depend on distributions from our subsidiaries and from enable to meet our payment obligations and provisions of applicable law or contractual restrictions could limit the amount of those distributionswe derive all of our operating income from and hold all of our assets through our subsidiaries including our interests in enable as a result we depend on distributions from our subsidiaries including enable in order to meet our payment obligations in general our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to provide us with funds for our payment obligations whether by dividends distributions loans or otherwise in addition provisions of applicable law such as those limiting the legal sources of dividends limit our subsidiaries ability to make payments or other distributions to us and our subsidiaries could agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions for a discussion of risks that may impact the amount 21of cash distributions we receive with respect to our interests in enable please read  additional risk factors affecting our interests in enable midstream partners lp  our cash flows will be adversely impacted if we receive less cash distributions from enable than we currently expect our right to receive any assets of any subsidiary and therefore the right of our creditors to participate in those assets will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiarys creditors including trade creditors in addition even if we were a creditor of any subsidiary our rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by uspoor investment performance of the pension plan and factors adversely affecting the calculation of pension liabilities could unfavorably impact our liquidity and results of operationswe maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering all employees our costs of providing this plan are dependent upon a number of factors including the investment returns on plan assets the level of interest rates used to calculate the funded status of the plan our contributions to the plan and government regulations with respect to funding requirements and the calculation of plan liabilities funding requirements may increase as a result of a decline in the market value of plan assets a decline in the interest rates used to calculate the present value of future plan obligations or government regulations that increase minimum funding requirements or the pension liability in addition to affecting our funding requirements each of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial positionthe use of derivative contracts in the normal course of business by us our subsidiaries or enable could result in financial losses that could negatively impact our results of operations and those of our subsidiaries or enablewe and our subsidiaries use derivative instruments such as swaps options futures and forwards to manage our commodity weather and financial market risks enable may also use such instruments from time to time to manage its commodity and financial market risk we our subsidiaries or enable could recognize financial losses as a result of volatility in the market values of these contracts or should a counterparty fail to perform in the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources the valuation of these financial instruments can involve managements judgment or use of estimates as a result changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could affect the reported fair value of these contractsother risk factors affecting our businesses or our interests in enable midstream partners lpwe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities arising from environmental laws and regulationsour operations are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health safety and the environment as an owner or operator of natural gas pipelines and distribution systems and electric transmission and distribution systems we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal state and local levels these laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways such as restricting the way we can handle or dispose of wasteslimiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered speciesrequiring remedial action to mitigate environmental conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operationsenjoining the operations of facilities deemed in noncompliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations andimpacting the demand for our services by directly or indirectly affecting the use or price of natural gasin order to comply with these requirements we may need to spend substantial amounts and devote other resources from time to time to construct or acquire new equipmentacquire permits for facility operations22modify or replace existing and proposed equipment andclean up or decommission waste disposal areas fuel storage and management facilities and other locations and facilitiesfailure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative civil and criminal enforcement measures including the assessment of monetary penalties the imposition of remedial actions and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released moreover it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environmentthe recent trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be greater than the amounts we currently anticipateour insurance coverage may not be sufficient insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of our facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of our facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flowsin common with other companies in its line of business that serve coastal regions centerpoint houston does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system other than substations because centerpoint houston believes it to be cost prohibitive in the future centerpoint houston may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring its transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm restoration bonds or a change in its regulated rates or otherwise or any such recovery may not be timely granted therefore centerpoint houston may not be able to restore any loss of or damage to any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations financial condition and cash flowswe centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with businesses and assets that we have transferred to othersunder some circumstances we centerpoint houston and cerc could incur liabilities associated with assets and businesses we centerpoint houston and cerc no longer own these assets and businesses were previously owned by reliant energy incorporated reliant energy a predecessor of centerpoint houston directly or through subsidiaries and includemerchant energy energy trading and rep businesses transferred to rri or its subsidiaries in connection with the organization and capitalization of rri prior to its initial public offering in 2001 and now owned by affiliates of nrg andtexas electric generating facilities transferred to a subsidiary of texas genco holdings inc texas genco in 2002 later sold to a third party and now owned by an affiliate of nrgin connection with the organization and capitalization of rri now genon that company and its subsidiaries assumed liabilities associated with various assets and businesses reliant energy transferred to them rri also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston and cerc with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses these indemnity provisions were intended to place sole financial responsibility on rri and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of rri regardless of the time those liabilities arose if rri now genon were unable to satisfy a liability that has been so assumed in circumstances in which reliant energy and its subsidiaries were not released from the liability in connection with the transfer we centerpoint houston or cerc could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityprior to the distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rris trading subsidiary when the companies separated rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guarantees rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation pursuant to such agreement as amended in december 2007 rri now genon agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cercs obligations under its 23remaining guarantees for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guarantees based on an annual calculation with any required collateral to be posted each december the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts which will be in effect until 2018 was approximately 58 million as of december 31 2013 based on market conditions in the fourth quarter of 2013 at the time the most recent annual calculation was made under the agreement genon was not obligated to post any security if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations cerc could have to honor its guarantee and in such event any collateral then provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cercs obligationsif genon were unable to meet its obligations it could consider among various options restructuring under the bankruptcy laws in which event genon might not honor its indemnification obligations and claims by genons creditors might be made against us as its former ownerreliant energy and rri genons predecessor are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits arising out of sales of natural gas in california and other markets although these matters relate to the business and operations of genon claims against reliant energy have been made on grounds that include liability of reliant energy as a controlling shareholder of genons predecessor we centerpoint houston or cerc could incur liability if claims in one or more of these lawsuits were successfully asserted against us centerpoint houston or cerc and indemnification from genon were determined to be unavailable or if genon were unable to satisfy indemnification obligations owed with respect to those claimsin connection with the organization and capitalization of texas genco now an affiliate of nrg reliant energy and texas genco entered into a separation agreement in which texas genco assumed liabilities associated with the electric generation assets reliant energy transferred to it texas genco also agreed to indemnify and cause the applicable transferee subsidiaries to indemnify us and our subsidiaries including centerpoint houston with respect to liabilities associated with the transferred assets and businesses in many cases the liabilities assumed were obligations of centerpoint houston and centerpoint houston was not released by third parties from these liabilities the indemnity provisions were intended generally to place sole financial responsibility on texas genco and its subsidiaries for all liabilities associated with the current and historical businesses and operations of texas genco regardless of the time those liabilities arose if texas genco now an affiliate of nrg were unable to satisfy a liability that had been so assumed or indemnified against and provided we or reliant energy had not been released from the liability in connection with the transfer centerpoint houston could be responsible for satisfying the liabilityin connection with our sale of texas genco the separation agreement was amended to provide that texas genco would no longer be liable for and we would assume and agree to indemnify texas genco against liabilities that texas genco originally assumed in connection with its organization to the extent and only to the extent that such liabilities are covered by certain insurance policies held by us we or our subsidiaries have been named along with numerous others as a defendant in lawsuits filed by a number of individuals who claim injury due to exposure to asbestos some of the claimants have worked at locations owned by us but most existing claims relate to facilities previously owned by our subsidiaries we anticipate that additional claims like those received may be asserted in the future under the terms of the arrangements regarding separation of the generating business from us and our sale of that business to an affiliate of nrg ultimate financial responsibility for uninsured losses from claims relating to the generating business has been assumed by the nrg affiliate but we have agreed to continue to defend such claims to the extent they are covered by insurance maintained by us subject to reimbursement of the costs of such defense by the nrg affiliatecyberattacks acts of terrorism or other disruptions

risks related to breaches in the systems and technology used i to manage operations and other business processes and ii to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business the operation of our electric transmission and distribution system is dependent on not only physical interconnection of our facilities but also on communications among the various components of our system

congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and there has been a wideranging policy debate both nationally and internationally regarding the impact of these gases and possible means for their regulation in addition efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues such as the united nations climate change conference in doha qatar in 2012 following a finding by the epa that certain ghgs represent an endangerment to human health the epa adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act one that requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and another that regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources in addition the epa expanded its existing ghg emissions reporting requirements to include upstream petroleum and natural gas systems that emit 25000 metric tons or more of co2 equivalent per year these permitting and reporting requirements could lead to further regulation of ghgs by the epa as a distributor and transporter of natural gas or a consumer of natural gas in its pipeline and gathering businesses cercs or enables revenues operating costs and capital requirements as applicable could be adversely affected as a result of any regulatory action that would require installation of new control technologies or a modification of its operations or would have the effect of reducing the consumption of natural gas our electric transmission and distribution business in contrast to some electric utilities does not generate electricity and thus is not directly exposed to the risk of high capital costs and regulatory uncertainties that face electric utilities that burn fossil fuels to generate electricity nevertheless centerpoint houstons revenues could be adversely affected to the extent any resulting regulatory action has the effect of reducing consumption of electricity by ultimate consumers within its service territory likewise incentives to conserve energy or use energy sources other than natural gas could result in a decrease in demand for our servicesclimate changes could result in more frequent and more severe weather events which could adversely affect the results of operations of our businessesto the extent climate changes occur our businesses may be adversely impacted though we believe any such impacts are likely to occur very gradually and hence would be difficult to quantify with specificity to the extent global climate change results in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our natural gas distribution businesses could be adversely affected through lower gas sales and our gas transmission and field services businesses could experience lower revenues another possible climate change is more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes or tornadoes since many of our facilities are located along or near the gulf coast increased or more severe hurricanes or tornadoes could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers when we cannot deliver electricity or natural gas to customers or our customers cannot receive our services our financial results can be impacted by lost revenues and we generally must seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we are unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for our services our future financial results may be adversely impactedadditional risk factors affecting our interests in enable midstream partners lpwe hold a

distributable cash as such term is defined in its partnership agreement to its limited partners each fiscal quarter within 45 days following the end of the applicable quarter following an initial public offering of enable i we expect that both cerc corp and oge will hold their limited partnership interests in enable in the form of both common units and subordinated units and ii enable is expected to pay a specified minimum quarterly distribution on its outstanding units to the extent it has sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses including payments to its general partner and its affiliates referred to as available cash the principal difference between enables common units and subordinated units is that in any quarter during the applicable subordination period holders of the subordinated units are not entitled to receive any distribution of available cash until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on common units from prior quarters if enable does not pay distributions on its subordinated units its subordinated units will not accrue arrearages for those unpaid distributions accordingly if enable is unable to pay its 26minimum quarterly distribution following is initial public offering the amount of cash distributions we receive from enable may be adversely affected enable may not have sufficient available cash each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution the amount of cash enable can distribute on its units will principally depend upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on among other things the

the failure to extend or replace these contracts or the extension or replacement of these contracts on less favorable terms as a result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect enables consolidated financial position results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions  enables businesses are dependent in part on the drilling and production decisions of others  enables businesses are dependent on the continued availability of natural gas and crude oil production enable has no control over the level of drilling activity in its areas of operation the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to its systems or the rate at which production from a well declines in addition enables cash flows associated with wells currently connected to its systems will decline over time to maintain or increase throughput levels on its gathering and transportation systems and the asset utilization rates at its natural gas processing plants enables customers must continually obtain new natural gas and crude oil supplies the primary factors affecting enables ability to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil and attract new customers to its assets are the level of successful drilling activity near these systems its ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and its ability to expand capacity as needed if enable is not able to obtain new supplies of natural gas and crude oil to replace the natural decline in volumes from existing wells throughput on its gathering processing transportation and storage facilities will decline which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow enable has no control over producers or their drilling and production decisions which are affected by among other things the availability and cost of capital prevailing and projected commodity prices including the prices of natural gas ngls and crude oildemand for natural gas ngls and crude oil levels of reserves geological considerations environmental or other governmental regulations including the availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipmentfluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new natural gas and crude oil reserves drilling and production activity generally decreases as commodity prices decrease in general terms the prices of natural gas crude oil and other hydrocarbon products fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond enables control because of these factors even if new natural gas or crude oil reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves declines in natural gas or crude oil prices can have a negative impact on exploration development and production activity and if sustained could lead to decreases in such activity a sustained decline could also lead producers to shut in production from their existing wells sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in enables areas of operation could lead to further reductions in the utilization of its systems which could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  in addition it may be more difficult to maintain or increase the current volumes on enables gathering systems as several of the formations in the unconventional resource basins in which it operates generally have higher initial production rates and steeper production decline curves than wells in more conventional basins should enable determine that the economics of its gathering assets do not justify the capital expenditures needed to grow or maintain volumes associated therewith enable may reduce such capital expenditures which could cause revenues associated with these assets to decline over time in addition to capital expenditures to support growth the steeper production decline curves associated with unconventional resource plays may require enable to incur higher maintenance capital expenditures relative to throughput over time which will reduce its distributable cash flow  because of these and other factors even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by enables assets producers may choose not to develop those reserves reductions in drilling activity would result in enables inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on its systems and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and distributable cash flow 29 enables industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect its results of operations and distributable cash flow  enable competes with similar enterprises in its respective areas of operation the principal elements of competition are rates terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service enables competitors include large crude oil natural gas and petrochemical companies that have greater financial resources and access to supplies of natural gas ngls and crude oil than enable some of these competitors may expand or construct gathering processing transportation and storage systems that would create additional competition for the services enable provides to its customers excess pipeline capacity in the regions served by enables interstate pipelines could also increase competition and adversely impact enables ability to renew or enter into new contracts with respect to its available capacity when existing contracts expire in addition enables customers that are significant producers of natural gas may develop their own gathering processing transportation and storage systems in lieu of using enables systems enables ability to renew or replace existing contracts with its customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flows could be adversely affected by the activities of its competitors and customers further natural gas utilized as a fuel competes with other forms of energy available to endusers including electricity coal and liquid fuels increased demand for such forms of energy at the expense of natural gas could lead to a reduction in demand for natural gas gathering processing transportation and transportation services all of these competitive pressures could adversely affect enables results of operations and distributable cash flowenable may not be able to recover the costs of its substantial planned investment in capital improvements and additions and the actual cost of such improvements and additions may be significantly higher than it anticipates  enables business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions the construction of additions or modifications to enables existing systems and the construction of new midstream assets involves numerous regulatory environmental political and legal uncertainties many of which are beyond enables control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital which may exceed its estimates these projects may not be completed at the planned cost on schedule or at all the construction of new pipeline gathering treating processing compression or other facilities is subject to construction cost overruns due to labor costs costs of equipment and materials such as steel labor shortages or weather or other delays inflation or other factors which could be material in addition the construction of these facilities is typically subject to the receipt of approvals and permits from various regulatory agencies those agencies may not approve the projects in a timely manner if at all or may impose restrictions or conditions on the projects that could potentially prevent a project from proceeding lengthen its expected completion schedule andor increase its anticipated cost moreover enables revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project for instance if enable expands an existing pipeline or constructs a new pipeline the construction may occur over an extended period of time and enable may not receive any material increases in revenues or cash flows until the project is completed in addition enable may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize as a result the new facilities may not be able to achieve enables expected investment return which could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions  in connection with enables capital investments enable may engage a third party to estimate potential reserves in areas to be developed prior to constructing facilities in those areas to the extent enable relies on estimates of future production in deciding to construct additions to its systems those estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating future production as a result new facilities may not be able to attract sufficient throughput to achieve expected investment return which could adversely affect enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions in addition the construction of additions to existing gathering and transportation assets may require new rightsofway prior to construction those rightsofway to connect new natural gas supplies to existing gathering lines may be unavailable and enable may not be able to capitalize on attractive expansion opportunities additionally it may become more expensive to obtain new rightsofway or to renew existing rightsofway if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rightsofway increases enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affectednatural gas ngl and crude oil prices are volatile and changes in these prices could adversely affect enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions  enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be negatively affected by adverse movements in the prices of natural gas ngls and crude oil depending on factors that are beyond its control these factors include demand for these commodities which fluctuates with changes in market and economic conditions and other factors including the impact of seasonality and weather general economic conditions the level of domestic and offshore natural gas production and consumption the availability of imported natural gas lng ngls and crude oil actions taken by foreign natural gas and oil producing nations the availability of local intrastate and interstate transportation systems the availability and marketing of competitive fuels the 30impact of energy conservation efforts technological advances affecting energy consumption and the extent of governmental regulation and taxation  enables keepwhole natural gas processing arrangements expose it to fluctuations in the pricing spreads between ngl prices and natural gas prices under these arrangements the processor processes raw natural gas to extract ngls and pays to the producer the natural gas equivalent btu value of raw natural gas received from the producer in the form of either processed natural gas or its cash equivalent the processor is generally entitled to retain the processed ngls and to sell them for its own account accordingly the processors margin is a function of the difference between the value of the ngls produced and the cost of the processed natural gas used to replace the natural gas equivalent btu value of those ngls therefore if natural gas prices increase and ngl prices do not increase by a corresponding amount the processor has to replace the btu of natural gas at higher prices and processing margins are negatively affected  under enables percentofproceeds and percentofliquids natural gas processing agreements the processor generally gathers raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead transports the natural gas through its gathering system processes the natural gas and sells the processed natural gas andor ngls at prices based on published index prices the price paid to producers is based on an agreed percentage of the actual proceeds of the sale of processed natural gas ngls or both or the expected proceeds based on an index price these arrangements expose enable to risks associated with the price of natural gas and ngls  at any given time enables overall portfolio of processing contracts may reflect a net short position in natural gas meaning that it is a net buyer of natural gas and a net long position in ngls meaning that it is a net seller of ngls as a result enables gross margin could be adversely impacted to the extent the price of ngls decreases in relation to the price of natural gas  enable has limited experience in the crude oil gathering business  in november 2013 enable commenced initial operations on a new crude oil gathering pipeline system in north dakotas bakken shale formation and enable expects to place additional related assets in service in 2014 the gathering system located in dunn and mckenzie counties in north dakota has a planned capacity of up to 19500 barrels per day these facilities are the first crude oil gathering system that enable has built and operated other operators of gathering systems in the bakken shale formation may have more experience in the construction operation and maintenance of crude oil gathering systems than enable this relative lack of experience may hinder enables ability to fully implement its business plan in a timely and cost efficient manner which in turn may adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions enable provides certain transportation and storage services under longterm fixedprice negotiated rate contracts that are not subject to adjustment even if its cost to perform such services exceeds the revenues received from such contracts and as a result enables costs could exceed its revenues received under such contracts  enable has been authorized by the ferc to provide transportation and storage services at its facilities at negotiated rates generally negotiated rates are in excess of the maximum recourse rates allowed by the ferc but it is possible that costs to perform services under negotiated rate contracts will exceed the revenues obtained under these agreements if this occurs it could decrease the cash flow realized by enables systems and therefore decrease the cash it has available for distribution   negotiated rate contracts generally do not include provisions allowing for adjustment for increased costs due to inflation pipeline safety activities or other factors that are not tied to an applicable tracking mechanism authorized by the ferc successful recovery of any shortfall of revenue representing the difference between recourse rates if higher and negotiated rates is not assured under current ferc policies  if thirdparty pipelines and other facilities interconnected to enables gathering processing or transportation facilities become partially or fully unavailable for any reason enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions could be adversely affected  enable depends upon thirdparty natural gas pipelines to deliver natural gas to and take natural gas from its transportation systems enable also depends on thirdparty facilities to transport and fractionate ngls that are delivered to the third party at the tailgates of the processing plants fractionation is the separation of the heterogeneous mixture of extracted ngls into individual components for enduse sale for example an outage or disruption on certain pipelines or fractionators operated by a third party could result in the shutdown of certain of enables processing plants and a prolonged outage or disruption could ultimately result in a reduction in the volume of ngls enable is able to produce additionally enable depends on third parties to provide electricity for compression at many of its facilities since enable does not own or operate any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities their continuing operation is not within its control if any of these thirdparty pipelines or other facilities become partially or fully 31unavailable for any reason enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions to unitholders could be adversely affected  enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located which could disrupt its operations  enable does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed and it is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms andor increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid rightsofway or if such rightsofway lapse or terminate enable may obtain the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time a loss of these rights through enables inability to renew rightofway contracts or otherwise could cause it to cease operations temporarily or permanently on the affected land increase costs related to the construction and continuing operations elsewhere and adversely affect its results of

obligations including the ability of the third parties to satisfy their obligations under these arrangements is outside enables control if these parties do not satisfy their obligations under these arrangements enables business may be adversely affectedenables joint venture arrangements may involve risks not otherwise present when operating assets directly for example enables joint venture partners may share certain approval rights over major decisions or be in a position to take actions contrary to enables instructions or requests or contrary to its policies or objectives these risks or the failure to continue enables joint ventures or to resolve disagreements with enables joint venture partners could adversely affect enables ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture which would in turn negatively affect enables financial condition and results of operations enables business involves many hazards and operational risks some of which may not be fully covered by insurance insufficient insurance coverage and increased insurance costs could adversely impact its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions  enables operations are subject to all of the risks and hazards inherent in the gathering processing transportation and storage of natural gas and crude oil including  damage to pipelines and plants related equipment and surrounding properties caused by hurricanes tornadoes floods fires and other natural disasters acts of terrorism and actions by third parties inadvertent damage from construction vehicles farm and utility equipment leaks of natural gas crude oil and other hydrocarbons or losses of natural gas and crude oil as a result of the malfunction of equipment or facilities ruptures fires and explosions and other hazards that could also result in personal injury and loss of life pollution and suspension of operations these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury andor loss of

natural disaster or other hazard affecting the areas in which enable operates could have a material adverse effect on its operations enable is not fully insured against all risks inherent in its business we and oge currently have general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of enables facilities in amounts that we consider appropriate such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles enable does not have business interruption insurance coverage for all of its operations insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms and the 32insurance proceeds received for any loss of or any damage to any of enables facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributionsenables ability to grow is dependent on its ability to access external financing sources  enable expects that it will distribute all of its available cash to its unitholders following its initial public offering as a result enable is expected to rely primarily upon external financing sources including commercial bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures as a result to the extent enable is unable to finance growth externally enables cash distribution policy will significantly impair its ability to grow in addition because enable is expected to distribute all of its available cash its growth may not be as fast as businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations  to the extent enable issues additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that enable will be unable to maintain or increase its per unit distribution level which in turn may impact the available cash that it has to distribute on each unit there are no limitations in enables partnership agreement on its ability to issue additional units including units ranking senior to the common units the incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt by enable to finance its growth strategy would result in increased interest expense which in turn may negatively impact the available cash that enable has to distribute to its unitholders  if enable does not make acquisitions or is unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms its future growth will be limited  enables ability to grow depends in part on its ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in its cash generated from operations if enable is unable to make accretive acquisitions either because i it is unable to identify attractive acquisition targets or it is unable to negotiate purchase contracts on acceptable terms ii it is unable to obtain acquisition financing on economically acceptable terms or iii it is outbid by competitors then its future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limitedenables debt levels may limit its flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunitiesas of december 31 2013 enable had approximately 19 billion of longterm debt outstanding and 200 million of shortterm debt outstanding excluding the premiums on senior notes enable has 363

borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility and market conditions enable will continue to have the ability to incur additional debt subject to limitations in its credit facilities the levels of enables debt could have important consequences including the followingthe ability to obtain additional financing if necessary for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or the financing may not be available on favorable terms if at alla portion of cash flows will be required to make interest payments on the debt reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations future business opportunities and distributionsenables debt level will make it more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in its business or the economy generally andenables debt level may limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditionsenables ability to service its debt will depend upon among other things its future financial and operating performance which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial business regulatory and other factors some of which are beyond enables control if operating results are not sufficient to service current or future indebtedness enable may be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions reducing or delaying business activities acquisitions investments or capital expenditures selling assets restructuring or refinancing debt or seeking additional equity capital these actions may not be effected on satisfactory terms or at all 33enables

financial ratios can be affected by events beyond its control and we cannot assure you that it will meet those ratios in addition enables credit facilities contain events of default customary for agreements of this natureenables ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit facilities may be affected by events beyond its control including prevailing economic financial and industry conditions if market or other economic conditions deteriorate enables ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired if enable violates any of the restrictions covenants ratios or tests in its credit facilities a significant portion of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable in addition enables lenders commitments to make further loans to it under the revolving credit facility may be suspended or terminated enable might not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments costs of compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations are significant and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect enables results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions  enable is subject to extensive federal state and local environmental statutes rules and regulations relating to air quality water quality waste management wildlife conservation natural resources and health and safety that could among other things delay or increase its costs of construction restrict or limit the output of certain facilities andor require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase costs there are significant capital operating and other costs associated with compliance with these environmental statutes rules and regulations and those costs may be even more significant in the future  there is inherent risk of the incurrence of environmental costs and liabilities in enables operations due to its handling of natural gas ngls and crude oil air emissions related to its operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices these activities are subject to stringent and complex federal state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection including the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of plants wildlife and natural and cultural resources these laws and regulations can restrict or impact enables business activities in many ways such as restricting the way it can handle or dispose of wastes or requiring remedial action to mitigate pollution conditions that may be caused by its operations or that are attributable to former operators joint and several strict liability may be incurred without regard to fault under certain of these environmental laws and regulations in connection with discharges or releases of wastes on under or from enables properties and facilities many of which have been used for midstream activities for a number of years oftentimes by third parties not under its control private parties including the owners of the properties through which enables gathering systems pass and facilities where its wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage for example an accidental release from one of enables pipelines could subject it to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations enable may be unable to recover these costs from insurance moreover the possibility exists that stricter laws regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary further stricter requirements could negatively impact enables customers production and operations resulting in less demand for its services34increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in natural gas production by enables customers which could adversely affect its results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas andor oil from dense subsurface rock formations the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production many of enables customers commonly use hydraulic fracturing techniques in their drilling and completion programs hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions in addition congress from time to time has considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process some states have adopted and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular if new or more stringent federal state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where enables oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate they could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration development or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells some or all of which activities could adversely affect demand for enables services to those customers  in addition certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater a draft final report drawing conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources is currently expected to be available for public comment and peer review in 2014 moreover the epa has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by 2014 other governmental agencies including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing president obama created the interagency working group on unconventional natural gas and oil by executive order on april 13 2012 which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources including hydraulic fracturing these ongoing or proposed studies depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms enables operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal regulatory authorities changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could have a material adverse effect on enables results of operations and ability to make cash distributions  the rates charged by several of enables pipeline systems including for interstate gas transportation service provided by its intrastate pipelines are regulated by the ferc the ferc and state regulatory agencies also regulate other terms and conditions of the services enable may offer if one of these regulatory agencies on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties were to lower its tariff rates or deny any rate increase or other material changes to the types or terms and conditions of service enable might propose or offer the profitability of enables pipeline businesses could suffer if enable were permitted to raise its tariff rates for a particular pipeline there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect which could also limit its profitability furthermore competition from other pipeline systems may prevent enable from raising its tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit it to do so the regulatory agencies that regulate enables systems periodically implement new rules regulations and terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the rates charged for enables services or otherwise adversely affect its financial condition results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions  enables natural gas interstate pipelines are regulated by the ferc under the natural gas act of 1938 or nga the natural gas policy act of 1978 or the ngpa and the energy policy act of 2005 or epact of 2005 generally the fercs authority over interstate natural gas transportation extends to  rates operating terms conditions of service and service contractscertification and construction of new facilities extension or abandonment of services and facilities or expansion of existing facilities maintenance of accounts and records acquisition and disposition of facilities 35initiation and discontinuation of servicesdepreciation and amortization policies conduct and relationship with certain affiliates market manipulation in connection with interstate sales purchases or natural gas transportation and various other matters  the fercs jurisdiction extends to the certification and construction of interstate transportation and storage facilities including but not limited to expansions lateral and other facilities and abandonment of facilities and services prior to commencing construction of significant new interstate transportation and storage facilities an interstate pipeline must obtain a certificate authorizing the construction or an order amending its existing certificate from the ferc certain minor expansions are authorized by blanket certificates that the ferc has issued by rule typically a significant expansion project requires review by a number of governmental agencies including state and local agencies whose cooperation is important in completing the regulatory process on schedule any failure by an agency to issue sufficient authorizations or permits in a timely manner for one or more of these projects may mean that enable will not be able to pursue these projects or that they will be constructed in a manner or with capital requirements that enable did not anticipate enables inability to obtain sufficient permits and authorizations in a timely manner could materially and negatively impact the additional revenues expected from these projects  the ferc conducts audits to verify compliance with the fercs regulations and the terms of its orders including whether the websites of interstate pipelines accurately provide information on the operations and availability of services the fercs regulations require uniform terms and conditions for service as set forth in agreements for transportation and storage services executed between interstate pipelines and their customers these service agreements are required to conform in all material respects with the standard form of service agreements set forth in the pipelines fercapproved tariff nonconforming agreements must be filed with and accepted by the ferc in the event that the ferc finds that an agreement in whole or part is materially nonconforming it could reject the agreement or require enable to seek modification or alternatively require it to modify its tariff so that the nonconforming provisions are generally available to all customers  the rates terms and conditions for transporting natural gas in interstate commerce on certain of enables intrastate pipelines and for services offered at certain of its storage facilities are subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc under section 311 of the ngpa rates to provide such interstate transportation service must be fair and equitable under the ngpa and are subject to review refund with interest if found not to be fair and equitable and approval by the ferc at least once every five years  enables crude oil gathering pipelines are subject to common carrier regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act or ica the ica requires that enable maintain tariffs on file with the ferc setting forth the rates it charges for providing transportation services as well as the rules and regulations governing such services the ica requires among other things that enables rates must be just and reasonable and that it provides service in a manner that is nondiscriminatory  enables operations may also be subject to regulation by state and local regulatory authorities changes or additional regulatory measures adopted by such authorities could adversely affect its results of operations and its ability to make cash distributions enables pipeline operations that are not regulated by the ferc may be subject to state and local regulation applicable to intrastate natural and transportation services the relevant states in which enable operates include north dakota oklahoma arkansas louisiana texas missouri kansas mississippi tennessee and illinois state and local regulations generally focus on safety environmental and in some circumstances prohibition of undue discrimination among shippers additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered and in some instances adopted from time to time we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes other state and local regulations also may affect enables business any such state or local regulation could have an adverse effect on its business and the results of its operations  enables gathering lines may be subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take without undue discrimination oil or natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling similarly common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer these statutes restrict enables right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom it contracts to purchase or transport oil or natural gas federal law leaves economic regulation of natural gas gathering to the states the states in which 36enable operates have adopted complaintbased regulation of oil and natural gas gathering activities which allows oil and natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to access to oil and natural gas gathering pipelines and rate discrimination  other state regulations may not directly regulate enables business but may nonetheless affect the availability of natural gas for processing including state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowable from gas wells while enables gathering lines are currently subject to limited state regulation there is a risk that state laws will be changed which may give producers a stronger basis to challenge the regulatory status of a line or the rates terms and conditions of a gathering line providing transportation service  a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of enables assets by federal state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of its assets which may cause its revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase  enables natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation operations are generally exempt from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga but ferc regulation may indirectly impact these businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses the fercs policies and practices across the range of its oil and natural gas regulatory activities including for example its policies on interstate open access transportation ratemaking capacity release and market center promotion may indirectly affect intrastate markets in recent years the ferc has pursued procompetitive policies in its regulation of interstate oil and natural gas pipelines however we cannot assure you that the ferc will continue to pursue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas transportation business although the ferc has not made a formal determination with respect to all of enables facilities it considers to be gathering facilities enable believe that its natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests that the ferc has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and are therefore not subject to ferc jurisdiction the distinction between fercregulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services however has been the subject of substantial litigation and the ferc determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a casebycase basis so the classification and regulation of enables gathering facilities is subject to change based on future determinations by the ferc the courts or congress if the ferc were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility andor services provided by it are not exempt from ferc regulation under the nga and that the facility provides interstate service the rates for and terms and conditions of services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by the ferc under the nga or the ngpa such regulation could decrease revenue increase operating costs and depending upon the facility in question could adversely affect enables financial condition results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make cash distributions in addition if any of enables facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the nga or ngpa this could result in the imposition of substantial civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge revenues collected for such services in excess of the maximum rates established by the ferc  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny at the state level therefore enables natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they become subject to the application of state regulation of rates and services enables gathering operations could also be subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design construction testing operation replacement and maintenance of gathering facilities we cannot predict what effect if any such changes might have on enables operations but enable could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes enable may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs  the dot has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transportation pipelines located in high consequence areas which are those areas where a leak or rupture could do the most harm the regulations require operators including enable to among other things  develop a baseline plan to prioritize the assessment of a covered pipeline segment identify and characterize applicable threats that could impact a high consequence area improve data collection integration and analysis repair and remediate pipelines as necessary and implement preventive and mitigating action 37 although many of enables pipelines fall within a class that is currently not subject to these requirements it may incur significant cost and liabilities associated with repair remediation preventive or mitigation measures associated with its nonexempt pipelines should enable fail to comply with dot or comparable state regulations it could be subject to penalties and fines also the scope of the integrity management program and other related pipeline safety programs could be expanded in the futureitem 1bunresolved staff commentsnoneitem 2propertiescharacter of ownershipwe lease or own our principal properties in fee including our corporate office space and various real

and a 2505 interest in sesh currently owned by cercother operationsour other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operationsexecutive summaryfactors influencing our businesses  we are an energy delivery company the majority of our revenues are generated from the sale of natural gas and the transmission and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to enduse electric customers to assess our financial performance our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments within these broader financial measures we monitor margins operation and maintenance expense interest expense capital spending and working capital requirements in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments including the number of customers throughput use per customer commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days we also monitor system reliability safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performanceto the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry also adverse economic conditions coupled with concerns for protecting the environment may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities resulting in less demand for our servicesperformance of our electric transmission amp distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis the houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during 2011 in 2012 we experienced a return to more normal weather in the summer months however every state in which we distribute natural gas had the warmest winter on record in 2013 we experienced a colder than normal spring and very cold weather in november and december in houston and all of the states in which we have gas customers in recent years customers have typically reduced their energy consumption and reduced consumption can adversely affect our results however due to more affordable energy prices and continued economic improvement in the areas we serve the trend toward lower usage has slowed in some of the areas we serve in addition in many of our service areas particularly in the houston area and in minnesota we have benefited from a growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption we anticipate that this trend will continue as the regions economies resume typical growth the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates our energy services business segment contracts with customers for transportation storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the united states the segment benefits from favorable price differentials either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis while this business utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level or var to avoid significant financial exposures lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during 2013 2012 and 2011 adversely affected results for this business segmentthe nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment and we rely on internally generated cash borrowings under our credit facilities proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of 42debt as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets disruptions in the financial markets can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive in those circumstances companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept for that reason we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt we expect to make contributions to our pension plan aggregating approximately 87 million in 2014 and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our gas operations in texas factors influencing our midstream investments segmentthe results of our midstream investments segment are primarily dependent upon the results of enable which are driven primarily by the volume of natural gas that enable gathers processes and transports across its systems which depends significantly on the level of production from natural gas wells connected to its systems aggregate production volumes are affected by the overall amount of drilling and completion activity as production must be maintained or increased by new drilling or other activity because the production rate of a natural gas well declines over time producers willingness to engage in new drilling is determined by a number of factors the most important of which are the prevailing and projected prices of natural gas and ngls the cost to drill and operate a well the availability and cost of capital and environmental and government regulations the level of drilling is expected to positively correlate with longterm trends in commodity prices similarly production levels nationally and regionally generally tend to positively correlate with drilling activity to maintain and increase gathering throughput volumes on its systems enable must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers and marketers enables transportation and storage systems compete for customers based on the type of service a customer needs operating flexibility receipt and delivery points and geographic flexibility and available capacity and price to maintain and increase enables transportation and storage volumes it must continue to contract its capacity to shippers including producers marketers ldcs power generators and endusers enables operation and maintenance expenses are comprised primarily of labor expenses lease costs utility costs insurance premiums and repairs and maintenance expenses these expenses generally remain relatively stable across broad ranges of throughput volumes but can fluctuate from period to period depending on the mix of activities performed during that period and the timing of these expenses the current high levels of crude oil exploration development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment this increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices enable pays for labor supplies and miscellaneous equipment to the extent enable is unable to procure necessary services or offset higher costs its operating results will be negatively affected our midstream investments segment currently includes a 2505 interest in sesh owned by cerc that may be contributed by cerc to enable in the future upon exercise of certain put or call rights under which cerc would contribute to enable cercs retained interest in sesh at a price equal to the fair market value of such interest at the time

exceptionscritical accounting policiesa critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element item or account in the financial statements accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events or the present status of an asset or liability the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made additionally different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition results of operations or cash flows the circumstances that make these judgments difficult subjective andor complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments these estimates may change as new events occur as more experience is acquired as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates accordingly these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directorsaccounting for rate regulationaccounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rateregulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected our electric transmission amp distribution business segment and our natural gas distribution business segment apply this accounting guidance certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes but is not limited to consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings proposed regulatory decisions final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities at december 31 2013 we had recorded regulatory assets of 37 billion and regulatory liabilities of 12 billion64impairment of longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investmentswe review the carrying value of our longlived assets including identifiable intangibles goodwill and equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets a loss in value of an equity method investment is recognized when the decline is deemed to be other than temporary unforeseen events and changes in market conditions could have a material effect on the value of longlived assets including intangibles goodwill and equity method investments due to changes in estimates of future cash flows interest rate and regulatory matters and could result in an impairment charge we recorded goodwill impairment of 0 252 million and 0 during 2013 2012 and 2011 we did not record material impairments to longlived assets including intangibles or equity method investments during 2013 2012 and 2011we performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of 2013 and determined based on the results of the first step using the income approach no impairment charge was required for any reporting unit our reporting units approximate our reportable segmentsfair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniquesthe determination of fair value requires significant assumptions by management which are subjective and forwardlooking in nature to assist in making these assumptions we utilized a thirdparty valuation specialist in both determining and testing key assumptions used in the valuation of each of our reporting units we based our assumptions on projected financial information that we believe is reasonable however actual results may differ materially from those projections these projected cash flows factor in planned growth initiatives and for our natural gas distribution reporting unit the regulatory environment the fair value of our natural gas distribution and energy services reporting units exceeded the carrying value by approximately 23 billion and 259 million respectively or approximately 80 and 50 excess fair value over the carrying values for each reporting unit respectively a key assumption in the income approach was the weighted average cost of capital of 51 and 60 applied in the valuation for natural gas distributions and energy services respectively although there was not a goodwill asset impairment in our 2013 annual test an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected significant adverse changes in the operating environment an increase in the discount rate changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature or if our market capitalization falls below book value for an extended period of time no impairment triggers were identified subsequent to our 2013 annual testunbilled energy revenuesrevenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers however the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month either electronically through ams meter communications or manual readings at the end of each month deliveries to nonams customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated information regarding deliveries to ams customers after the last billing is obtained from actual ams meter usage data unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on actual ams meter data daily supply volumes and applicable rates unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect as additional information becomes available or actual amounts are determinable the recorded estimates are revised consequently operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates65pension and other retirement planswe sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these factors include assumptions about the discount rate expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management within certain guidelines in addition our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded please read  other significant matters  pension plans for further discussion new accounting pronouncementssee note 2o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect usother significant matterspension plans as discussed in note 6b to our consolidated financial statements we maintain a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes under the terms of our pension plan we reserve the right to change modify or terminate the plan our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were 83 million 73 million and 35 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively we made contributions of 83 million 73 million and 65 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 for the respective years we expect to make contributions aggregating approximately 87 million in 2014 additionally we maintain an unfunded nonqualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our noncontributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated employer contributions for the nonqualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled 8 million 9 million and 10 million in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants as such significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants as the sponsor of a plan we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plans overfunded status or as a liability such plans underfunded status b measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets as of december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by 350 million changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during 2014 could materially positively or negatively change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions pension cost was 72 million 82 million and 78 million for 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively of which 64 million 67 million and 49 million impacted pretax earnings  the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions two of the most critical assumptions are the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate as of december 31 2013 our qualified pension plan had an expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 700 which is a 100 decrease from the rate assumed as of december 31 2012 due to the increase in the allocation to fixed income investments in our targeted asset allocation the expected rate of return assumption was developed by a weightedaverage return analysis of the targeted asset allocation for centerpoint energys plans and the expected real return for each asset class based on the long66term capital market assumptions adjusted for investment fees and diversification effects in addition to expected inflation we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets to reduce volatility and better match plan assets and liabilities as of december 31 2013 the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of 480 which is a 080 increase from the 400 discount rate assumed in 2012 the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on highquality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan pension cost for 2014 including the benefit restoration plan is estimated to be 71 million of which we expect 63 million to impact pretax earnings based on an expected return on plan assets of 700 and a discount rate of 480 as of december 31 2013 if the expected return assumption were lowered by 050 from 700 to 650 2014 pension cost would increase by approximately 9 million  as of december 31 2013 the pension plan projected benefit obligation including the unfunded benefit restoration plan exceeded plan assets by 350 million if the discount rate were lowered by 050 from 480 to 430 the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and 2014 pension expense by approximately 103 million and 5 million respectively in addition the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december 31 2013 by 84 million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in 2013 of 12 million net of tax future changes in plan asset returns assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will beitem 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskimpact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity priceswe are exposed to various market risks these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements most of the revenues and income from our business activities are affected by market risks categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through nontrading activities interest rates and equity prices a description of each market risk is set forth belowcommodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices forward prices and price volatilities of commodities such as natural gas natural gas liquids and other energy commoditiesinterest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest ratesequity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securitiesmanagement has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework we manage our commodity price risk exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts during the normal course of business we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situationderivative instruments such as futures forward contracts swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets indices reference rates or a combination of these factors these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts which are referred to as overthecounter derivatives and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchangederivative transactions are entered into in our nontrading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedgedinterest rate risk  as of december 31 2013 we had outstanding longterm debt lease obligations and obligations under our zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 67our floating rate obligations aggregated 118 million and 0 at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectivelyas of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had outstanding fixedrate debt excluding indexed debt securities aggregating 81 billion and 97 billion respectively in principal amount and having a fair value of 86 billion and 109 billion respectively because these instruments are fixedrate they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note 12 to our consolidated financial statements however the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately 222 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from their levels at december 31 2013 in general such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturityas discussed in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements the zens obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component the debt component of 143 million at december 31 2013 was a fixedrate obligation and therefore did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates however the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately 24 million if interest rates were to decline by 10 from levels at december 31 2013 changes in the fair value of the derivative component a 455 million recorded liability at december 31 2013 are recorded in our statements of consolidated income and therefore we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying riskfree interest rate if the riskfree interest rate were to increase by 10 from december 31 2013 levels the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately 12 million which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated incomeequity market value riskwe are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of 71 million shares of tw common 18 million shares of twc common and 06 million shares of aol common which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens please read note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our zens obligation a decrease of 10 from the december 31 2013 aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of approximately 12 million which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated incomecommodity price risk from nontrading activitieswe use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses the standalone commodity risk created by these instruments without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge is described below we measure the commodity risk of our nontrading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis performed on our nontrading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical 10 movement in energy prices at december 31 2013 the recorded fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives was a net asset of 13 million before collateral all of which is related to our energy services business segment an increase of 10 in the market prices of energy commodities from their december 31 2013 levels would have decreased the fair value of our nontrading energy derivatives net asset by 4 million the above analysis of the nontrading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our nonderivative physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate furthermore the nontrading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio reducing overall risks within limits therefore the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of nontrading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions68item 8

impairment tests at least annually and evaluates goodwill when events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable the impairment evaluation for goodwill is performed by using a twostep process in the first step the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted cash flows if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded in the second step the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting units fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the differencecenterpoint energy performed its annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2013 and determined based on the results of the first step that no impairment charge was required for any reportable segment other intangibles were not material as of december 31 2013 and 2012centerpoint energy performed its annual impairment test in the third quarter of 2012 and determined that a noncash goodwill impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was required for the energy services reportable segment centerpoint energy estimated the value of the energy services reporting unit using an income approach under this approach the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by using the present value of future expected cash flows which are based on management projections of revenue growth gross margin and overall market conditions these estimated future cash flows are then discounted using a rate that approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a market participantthe energy services reporting unit fair value analysis resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill of 83 million for this reporting unit and as a result a noncash impairment charge in the amount of 252 million was recorded in the third quarter of 2012 the adverse wholesale market conditions facing centerpoint energys energy services business specifically the prospects for continued low geographic and seasonal price differentials for natural gas led to a reduction in the estimate of the fair value of goodwill associated with this reporting unit835regulatory accountinga regulatory assets and
