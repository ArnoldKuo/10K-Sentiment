of competitors who offer competing products in specialized areas such as fraud prevention risk management and application processing and decisioning solutions and software companies offering credit

existing market penetration new product innovation and our reputation as a trusted steward of information          8             technology and intellectual property     we generally seek protection

in connection with most of our product lines and services we believe that in the aggregate the rights under our patents and trademarks are generally important to our operations and competitive position but we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or group of patents or trademark however certain company trademarks which contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services including but not limited to the equifax trademark are an integral part of our business and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us we also

party we do not hold any franchises or concessions that are material to our business or results of operations     governmental regulation     we are subject to a number of us federal state local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business these laws and regulations may involve privacy data protection intellectual property competition consumer protection anticorruption antibribery employment health taxation or other subjects in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding the collection protection dissemination and use of nonpublic personal information we have in our possession and consumer financial protection foreign data and consumer protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the us failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements or the adoption of new laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect of our results of operations financial condition or liquidity     us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain these laws are enforced by federal state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate and in some instances also through private civil litigation there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning consumer and data protection which could affect us     summary of us regulation relating to consumer and data protection     our us operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the collection protection and use of consumer credit and other information and imposing sanctions for the misuse of such information or unauthorized access to data many of these provisions also affect our customers use of consumer credit or other data we furnish     examples of the most significant of these laws include but are not limited to the following     federal laws and regulation           the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 doddfrank act represented a comprehensive overhaul of the us financial services industry among other things title x of the doddfrank act established a new independent regulatory agency known as the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb the cfpb has broad powers to promulgate administer and enforce consumer financial regulations including those applicable to us and to many of our customers significant portions of federal regulatory oversight of the fair credit reporting act as amended fcra have been transferred from the federal trade commission ftc to the cfpb the cfpb is charged with defining unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices known as udaap and also may require reports and conduct examinations for purposes of assessing compliance with federal consumer financial protections laws may obtain information about the business activities affecting consumers and compliance systems or procedures and will devote resources to detecting and assessing risks to consumers and to markets for consumer financial products and services            9             the cfpb may pursue administrative proceedings or litigation to enforce these laws and rules in these proceedings the cfpb can obtain cease and desist orders which can include orders for restitution to consumers or rescission of contracts as well as other kinds of affirmative relief and monetary penalties ranging from 5000 per day for ordinary violations of federal consumer financial laws to 25000 per day for reckless violations and 1 million per day for knowing violations also where a company has violated title x of the doddfrank act or cfpb regulations under title x the doddfrank act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the cfpb but not for civil penalties     under udaap the cfpb has exercised its broad powers to examine the acts and practices of entities subject to its jurisdiction and declare those acts or practices to be unfair deceptive or abusive during 2013 the cfpb announced more than 20 enforcement actions and imposed more than 73 million in civil penalties and 27 billion in restitution     if the cfpb or one or more state officials believe that we have committed a violation of the foregoing laws they could exercise their enforcement powers in a manner that would have material adverse effect on us we are currently the subject of investigations by state attorneys general and the cfpb as more fully described under item 3 legal proceedings in the form 10k at this time we cannot predict the extent to which the doddfrank act the resulting rules and regulations including those of the cfpb or exercise of its or other enforcement powers will impact our operational results financial condition or liquidity     the cfpb confirmed in 2012 through rulemaking that we are subject to its supervisory examination and enforcement authority examinations may include the filing of reports reviewing materials we use to offer products and services and our compliance management systems and procedures our cfpb examinations to date have included our regulatory compliance management system and our north america personal solutions business unit directtoconsumer and an examination is planned for our consumer dispute handling process we are continuing to constructively engage with the cfpb on the results of completed or pending examinations           the federal trade commission act ftc act prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices we must comply with the ftc act when we market our services such as consumer credit monitoring services offered through our personal solutions unit the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers could also be subject to the ftc act and failure to safeguard data adequately may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action there is no private right of action under the ftc act             the fcra regulates consumer reporting agencies including us as well as data furnishers and users of consumer reports such as banks and other companies fcra provisions govern the accuracy fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies cras that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information

state laws and regulation relating to consumer and data protection           a number of states have enacted requirements similar to the federal fcra some of these state laws impose additional or more stringent requirements than the fcra especially in connection with the investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports the fcra preempts some of these state laws but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts the state of vermont is grandfathered under the original fcra requirements and thus we are subject to additional requirements to comply with vermont law             most states and the district of columbia have passed laws that give consumers the right to place a security freeze on their credit reports to prevent others from opening new accounts or obtaining new credit in their name these laws place differing requirements on credit reporting agencies with respect to how and when to respond to such credit file freeze requests and in the fees if any the agencies may charge for freezerelated actions             a majority of states have adopted versions of data security breach laws that require notification of affected consumers in the event of a breach of personal information some of these laws require additional data protection measures which exceed the glb act data safeguarding requirements if data within our system is compromised by a breach we may be subject to provisions of various state security breach laws       summary of international regulation relating to consumer and data protection     we are subject to various data protection privacy and consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate including among others the following           in canada federal and provincial privacy and provincial laws govern how we collect use or disclose personal information in the course of our commercial activities the federal personal information protection and electronic documents act of 2000 gives individuals the right to access and request correction of their personal information collected by us and requires compliance with the canadian standard association model code for the protection of personal information covering accountability and identifying purposes consent collection use disclosure retention accuracy safeguards individual access and compliance the federal and provincial privacy regulators have powers of investigation and intervention and provisions of canadian law regarding civil liability apply in the event of unlawful processing which is prejudicial to the persons concerned the european union or eu recognizes canada as having adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing             in the uk we are subject effective april 1 2014 to a new regulatory framework which provides for primary regulation by the financial conduct authority the fca the fca focuses on consumer protection and market regulation as well as prudential supervision of all other regulated financial institutions the fca has significant powers including the power to regulate conduct related to the marketing of financial products specify minimum standards and to place requirements on products impose unlimited fines and to investigate organizations and individuals in addition the fca is able to ban financial products for up to a year while considering an indefinite ban it will have the power to instruct firms to immediately retract or modify promotions which it finds to be misleading and to publish such decisions our core credit reporting credit reference and debt collections services businesses in the uk are subject to fca supervision and we will require certain corporate and approved person authorizations from the fca to carry on such businesses the fca has not yet fixed the date when credit reference agencies or collection businesses must apply for this authorization we are preparing to submit our license applications on or about october 1 2014 which is the earliest date the fca may require applications although we do not currently anticipate any issues in receiving authorization to the extent applicable licenses are not obtained in a timely manner or at all we may not conduct these businesses in the uk             in europe we are subject to the european union eu data protection regulations including the comprehensive 1995 european union data protection directive the eu regulations establish several obligations that organizations must follow with respect to use of personal data including a prohibition on the transfer of personal information from the eu to other countries whose laws do not protect personal data to an adequate level of privacy or security the eu standard for adequacy is generally stricter and more comprehensive than that of the us and most other countries where equifax operates in the uk in addition to the eu directive on data protection the data protection act of 1998 regulates the manner in which we can use thirdparty data in addition regulatory limitations affect our use of the electoral roll one of our key data sources in the uk generally the data underlying the products offered by our uk information services and personal solutions product lines excluding our commercial services products are subject to these regulations in spain and portugal the privacy laws which are subject to the eu directive on data protection regulate all credit bureau and personal solutions activities regulation relating to the 1995 eu data protection directive was proposed in 2012 by the european commission and is currently being considered by european legislative bodies that among other things could tighten data protection requirements and make enforcement more rigorous for example by streamlining enforcement at a european level introducing data breach notification requirements and increasing penalties for noncompliance            11                   in latin america consumer reporting data protection and privacy laws and regulations exist in various forms in argentina chile costa rica ecuador el salvador paraguay peru and uruguay argentina and uruguay generally follow the eu data protection model and the eu recognizes argentinas laws as providing adequate levels of protection for personal data transfers and processing among other protections laws in all of these countries generally allow individuals to access and request corrections of personal data             constitutional laws in argentina chile ecuador peru and uruguay also establish specific privacy rights and judicial proceedings may be used to enforce them the chilean legislature is considering a comprehensive data protection bill and a separate bill that would create a publiclymanaged consumer credit registry although each of these bills would introduce a new framework to allow the government to regulate the collection and use of personal data including credit data they are expected to have only a limited impact on our business in chile ecuadors national assembly recently approved a law to replace private sector credit bureaus with a staterun registry which when implemented would materially impact our local credit reporting operations in ecuador ecuador however represents less than three percent of our anticipated revenue and operating profit for our international business unit and is not material to our consolidated results of operations the government has not issued regulations yet to implement the changes and has indicated that private sector companies will be permitted to provide unspecified credit reference services ecuadors wtogatt commitments include no market access or national treatment limits for credit reference services the law provided a transition period throughout 2013 for the development and introduction of the new registry and that transition period has been extended through 2014 legislation has also been proposed in argentina and uruguay that would amend existing credit reporting laws by prohibiting the use of certain data for credit reference purposes shorten the period during which data may be used and create new access and notification rights for data subjects the argentinean legislation has not proceeded beyond the introductory debate stage and the uruguayan government does not support the legislation proposed in that country costa rica is finalizing regulations that will be issued under its data protection legislation while the potential impact of the foregoing regulatory changes is unlikely to be material in the aggregate to the results of our international operations if the market opportunity were to be restricted significantly in argentina or chile andor in a combination of the smaller latin american countries in which we operate the impact on our international operating results could be material             in india various legislation including the information technology act 2000 and the credit information companies regulation act of 2005 establishes a federal data protection framework entities that collect and maintain personal credit information must ensure that it is complete accurate and safeguarded and must adopt certain privacy principles with respect to collecting processing preserving sharing and using such credit
