levels of economic activity to consumer credit activity to a lesser extent small commercial credit and marketing activity and to our own initiatives to expand our products and markets served in 2013 in the united states we experienced modest growth in overall economic activity and in general consumer credit a moderate yearoveryear decline in consumer mortgage activity and continuing benefits from our internal product and market initiatives as expected after growing in the first half of 2013 total company mortgage related revenues declined significantly in the second half of 2013 a trend we expect will continue into the first half of 2014 as a result our mortgage solutions business units rate of yearoveryear revenue growth slowed in 2013 and the mortgagerelated components of revenue included in uscis online consumer information solutions and workforce solutions verification services each declined in absolute terms compared to 2012 while we continue to expect modest growth in overall economic activity and general consumer credit to continue in 2014 mortgage market origination activity is expected to continue declining due to elevated interest rates internationally the environment continues to be challenging as various countries address their particular political fiscal and economic issues in addition recent weakening in foreign exchange rates of certain of the countries in which we participate will reduce growth in revenue and profit when reported in us dollars offsetting these challenges we continue to expect that our ongoing investments in new product innovation business execution enterprise growth initiatives technology infrastructure and continuous process improvement will enable us in a modestly growing economy to deliver longterm average organic revenue growth ranging between 6 and 8 with additional growth of 1 to 2 derived from strategic acquisitions consistent with our long term business strategy we also expect to grow earnings per share at a somewhat faster rate than revenue over time as a result of both operating and financial leverage in 2014 we expect to offset the negative growth in mortgagerelated revenues with strong revenue growth in our core nonmortgage market initiatives          29             results of operations   twelve months ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011     consolidated financial results

growth was driven by the acquisition of csc credit services in the fourth quarter of 2012 csc credit services acquisition and the impact of strategic growth initiatives across our businesses the first half of 2013 also benefitted from the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us which as expected began to decline in the second half of 2013 as compared to the prior year this expected decline reduced reported growth rates in our uscis and workforce solutions business units for the second half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2013 for the full year the net decline in mortgage market activity reduced our revenue growth rate by approximately 17 the effect of foreign exchange rates reduced revenue by 204 million in the 2013 compared to 2012     revenue for 2012 increased by 9 compared to 2011 the deconsolidation of our brazilian business which resulted from the merger of our business into a larger entity during the second quarter of 2011 negatively impacted revenue growth by 354 million in 2012 compared to the prior year while all other revenue increased by 12 compared to 2011 the growth in 2012 was driven by strong execution of key strategic initiatives and the impact of increased mortgage refinancing activity in the us the effect of foreign exchange rates in locations other than brazil reduced revenue by 125 million in 2012 compared to the prior

prior year the increase in cost of services when compared to 2012 was due primarily to increased salary and benefit costs of 278 million as well as smaller increases across other categories the csc credit services acquisition did not have a material impact on cost of services as this business had already been processed on our systems under our previous affiliate arrangement the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of services by 49 million     cost of services increased 556 million in 2012 compared to the prior year the increase was due primarily to the impact of increased salary expense direct production expenses and contract service expenses of 632 million as well as smaller increases in other expenses to support revenue growth the increase in expense in 2012 was partially offset by decreases related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our cost of services by 34 million          30             selling general and administrative expenses selling general and administrative expenses increased 423 million in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due primarily to increased salary severance advertising litigation and regulatory compliance expenses of 564 million as well as smaller increases in expense in various categories as we continue to support our business growth 2013 expenses were also impacted by the csc credit services acquisition which contributed approximately 19 million of incremental selling general and administrative expenses some of which are transitional expenses as we integrate the business these expenses were partially offset by the 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 and declines in incentive costs the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 44 million     the increase in selling general and administrative expenses in 2012 as compared to 2011 included a 387 million noncash pension settlement charge that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2012 the remaining increase was primarily due to increased salary incentive and professional and contractor services expenses of 664 million as well as higher marketing and other expenses partially offset by decreases in expenses related to the deconsolidation of our brazilian business the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our selling general and administrative expenses by 27 million     depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2013 as compared to 2012 was driven by 491 million of incremental expense resulting from the csc credit services acquisition primarily related to amortization of purchased intangibles the csc credit services acquisition amortization is partially offset by certain purchased intangible assets related to the talx acquisition in 2007 that became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2013 as well as other miscellaneous purchased intangible assets that fully depreciated during 2013     the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily due to the decline in amortization of certain purchased intangibles acquired as part of the talx acquisition in 2007 which fully amortized during the second quarter of 2011 and the amortization and depreciation decrease resulting from the deconsolidation of our brazilian business this decrease was partially offset by our two 2011 acquisitions within workforce

operating income increased faster than revenue due to margin improvements in our workforce solutions north america personal solutions and north america commercial solutions businesses reflecting rapid

    in 2012 operating expenses increased at a slightly faster rate than revenue and operating income increased at a lower rate than revenue due to a 387 million pension settlement recorded during the fourth quarter of 2012 partially offset by improvements in margins in four of our business segments the overall operating margin decreased in 2012 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the pension settlement in 2012 which negatively impacted margin by 180 basis points and by increases in corporate expenses other than the pension settlement which increased faster than revenues these negative impacts on operating margin were partially offset by improvements in margins in our uscis international workforce solutions and personal solutions businesses driven by revenue growth

commercial paper during 2013 that was used to partially fund the csc credit services acquisition the decrease in the average cost of debt for 2013 is due to the issuance of the 500 million senior notes at a low interest rate and additional low rate commercial paper outstanding on average which caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year     interest expense increased slightly in 2012 when compared to the same period in 2011 due to the issuance of 500 million of 330 tenyear senior notes in december 2012 our consolidated debt balance increased at december 31 2012 as a result of the issuance of 500 million of 330 senior notes and additional borrowings in the form of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of csc credit services the decrease

caused the average cost of debt to decrease as compared to the prior year period     the increase in other expense income net in 2013 is due to the impairment of our cost method investment

compared to the prior year the csc credit services acquisition contributed 14 of the revenue growth in 2013 the remaining growth resulted from midsingle digit percentage growth from core nonmortgage products and from strategic product market penetration and pricing initiatives in the mortgage market more than offsetting a 2 decline from lower mortgage market activity in 2013     the increase in

into 2012     ocis revenue for 2013 increased 14 when compared to the prior year this increase was driven primarily by the incremental revenue from the csc credit services acquisition as compared to the prior year excluding the csc credit services acquisition revenue increased 1 in 2013 as compared to a year ago a 3 decline in 2013 in organic credit report transaction volume compared to the prior year was due to a decline in mortgagerelated credit report volume and lower volume from select high volume but lower priced accounts in the financial services market as well as changes in usage in the telecommunications sector this was offset by higher average unit revenue due to pricing initiatives and more favorable mix     2012 revenue increased 17 when compared to the prior year about half of the increase resulted from increased volume and improved pricing in mortgage enduse markets while the other half came predominantly from pricing and new product initiatives for the year core credit decision transaction volume increased by 4 while average revenue per transaction increased by 9 resulting from the increase in mortgage volume at higher than average pricing as a share of our overall mix and from specific market segment pricing initiatives while the remainder of our 17 growth came from products billed on a subscription basis and other revenue sources     mortgage solutions revenue increased 21 in 2013 when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the incremental revenue resulting from the csc credit services acquisition which contributed 18 of the growth in 2013 revenue also benefitted from increased new product sales and market share gains from existing customers revenue increased in 2012 when compared to 2011 due primarily to increased sales in core

manage risk and growth in settlement services revenue as a result of the favorable market conditions and increased market share from existing customers     consumer financial marketing services revenue increased 360 million or 24 in 2013 as compared to 2012 revenue related to the csc credit services acquisition contributed approximately 11 of the revenue growth in 2013 with the remainder coming from account acquisition and analytical services products delivered to members of our key client program revenue also benefitted from the collection of certain reserved billings related to both 2013 and 2012 revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011 resulting from a decline in demand for wealthbased consumer information services due to reductions in their use for credit marketing by some

which we refer to as the senior credit facility permits us to borrow up to 7500 million through december 2017 the senior credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes availability of the senior credit facility for borrowings is reduced by the outstanding face amount of any letters of credit issued under the facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization by the outstanding principal amount of our commercial paper cp notes     our 7500 million cp program has been established to allow for borrowing through the private placement of cp with maturities ranging from overnight to 397 days we may use the proceeds of cp for general corporate purposes the cp program is supported by our senior credit facility and pursuant to our existing board of directors authorization the total amount of cp which may be issued is reduced by the amount of any outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility     at december 31 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facility and no commercial paper notes outstanding at december 31 2013 a total of 7486 million was available under our senior credit facility     at december 31 2013 approximately 81 of our debt was fixed rate and 19 was effectively variable rate our variablerate debt consists of our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates generally bearing interest based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor and of our issued commercial paper which bears shortterm interest rates based on the cp market for investment grade issuers the interest rates reset periodically depending on the terms of the respective financing arrangements at december 31 2013 interest rates on our variablerate debt ranged from 187 to 204     borrowing and repayment activity net shortterm borrowings repayments primarily represent borrowings or repayments of outstanding amounts under our cp program we primarily borrow under our cp program when available     the decrease in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2013 primarily reflects the repayment of 2650 million of cp notes that were outstanding as of december 31 2012 the change in net shortterm borrowings repayments in 2012 primarily reflects the outstanding borrowings of 2650 million of cp notes as of december 31 2012 that was used to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services     on december 17 2012 we received proceeds of 4992 million from the issuance of tenyear senior notes with a stated interest rate of 330 in an underwritten public offering interest is payable semiannually in arrears on december 15 and june 15 of each year we used the net proceeds of the sale of the notes to partially finance the acquisition of csc credit services in december 2012          41             debt covenants our outstanding indentures and comparable instruments contain customary covenants including for example limits on secured debt and saleleaseback transactions in addition our senior credit facility requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of not more than 35 to 10 and limits the amount of subsidiary debt our leverage ratio was 174 at december 31 2013 none of these covenants are considered restrictive to our operations and as of december 31 2013 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants     we do not have any credit rating triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our outstanding debt however our senior notes contain change in control provisions if we experience a change of control or publicly announce our intention to effect a change of control and the rating on the senior notes is lowered by standard amp poors or sampp and moodys investors service or moodys below an investment grade rating within 60 days of such change of control or notice thereof then we will be required to offer to repurchase the senior notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest     credit ratings credit ratings reflect an independent agencys judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity the ratings reflect many considerations such as the nature of the borrowers industry and its competitive position the size of the company its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a companys cash flows to changes in the economy the two largest rating agencies sampp and moodys use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings the highest quality rating for longterm credit obligations is aaa and aaa for sampp and moodys respectively a security rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency     longterm ratings of bbb and baa3 or better by sampp and moodys respectively reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be investment grade at december 31 2013 the longterm ratings for our obligations were bbb and baa1 which are consistent with the ratings and outlooks which existed at december 31 2012 a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our cp program and credit facilities and could limit or in the case of a significant downgrade preclude our ability to issue cp if our credit ratings were to decline to lower levels we could experience increases in the interest cost for any new debt in addition the markets demand for and thus our ability to readily issue new debt could become further affected by the economic and credit market environment            42                  for additional information about our debt

unamortized discounts totaling 21 million and fair value adjustments of 60 million at december 31 2013 total debt on our consolidated balance sheets is net of the unamortized discounts and fair value adjustments           2  our operating lease obligations principally involve office space and equipment which include the ground lease associated with our headquarters building that expires in 2048           3  these agreements primarily represent our minimum contractual obligations for services that we outsource associated with our computer data processing operations and related functions and certain administrative functions these agreements expire between 2013 and 2018            43                 4  these longterm liabilities primarily relate to obligations associated with certain pension postretirement and other compensationrelated plans some of which are discounted in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap we made certain assumptions about the timing of such future payments in the table above we have not included amounts related to future pension plan obligations as such required funding amounts beyond 2013 have not been deemed necessary due to our current expectations regarding future plan asset performance           5  for future interest payments on variablerate debt which are generally based on a specified margin plus a base rate libor or on cp rates for investment grade issuers we used the variable rate in effect at december 31 2013 to calculate these payments our variable rate debt at december 31 2013 consisted of cp borrowings under our credit facilities and our fiveyear senior notes due 2014 against which we have executed interest rate swaps to convert interest expense from fixed rates to floating rates future interest payments related to our senior credit facility and our cp program are based on the borrowings outstanding at december 31 2013 through their respective maturity dates assuming such borrowings are outstanding until that time the variable portion of the rate at december 31 2013 ranged from 187 to 204 for all of our variablerate debt future interest payments may be different depending on future borrowing activity and interest rates           6  this table excludes 226 million of unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities            44             offbalance sheet transactions     we do not engage in offbalance sheet financing activities     pursuant to the terms of certain industrial revenue bonds we have transferred title to certain of our fixed assets with total costs of 826 million and 707 million as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively to a local governmental authority in the us to receive a property tax abatement related to economic development the title to these assets will revert back to us upon retirement or cancellation of the applicable bonds these fixed assets are still recognized on the companys consolidated balance sheets as all risks and rewards remain with the company     letters of credit and guarantees     we will from time to time issue standby letters of credit performance bonds or other guarantees in the normal course of business the aggregate notional amount of all performance bonds and standby letters of credit was not material at december 31 2013 and all have a remaining maturity of one year or less guarantees are issued from time to time to support the needs of our operating units the maximum potential future payments we could be required to make under the guarantees is not material at december 31 2013     benefit plans     we sponsor a qualified defined benefit retirement plan the us retirement income plan or usrip that covers approximately 20 of current us salaried employees who were hired on or before june 30 2007 the last date on which an individual could be hired and enter the plan before the usrip was frozen to new participation at december 31 2008 this plan also covers many retirees as well as certain terminated but vested individuals not yet in retirement status we also sponsor a defined benefit plan that covers most salaried and hourly employees in canada the canadian retirement income plan or crip the crip was frozen to new participants entering the plan on or after october 1 2011     at december 31 2013 the usrip met or exceeded erisas minimum funding requirements during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not make any contributions to the usrip we contributed 26 million and 37 million to the crip during the twelve months ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively in the future we will make minimum funding contributions as required and may make discretionary contributions depending on certain circumstances including market conditions and liquidity needs we believe additional funding contributions if any would not prevent us from continuing to meet our liquidity needs which are primarily funded from cash flows generated by operating activities available cash and cash equivalents and our credit facilities     for our nonus taxqualified retirement plans we fund an amount sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements but no more than allowed as a tax deduction pursuant to applicable tax regulations for the nonqualified supplementary retirement plans we fund the benefits as they are paid to retired participants but accrue the associated expense and liabilities in accordance with gaap     for additional information about our benefit plans see note 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report     seasonality     we experience seasonality in certain of our revenue streams revenue generated from the employer services business unit within the workforce solutions operating segment is generally higher in the first quarter due primarily to the provision of form w2 preparation services which occur in the first quarter each year revenue from our ocis and mortgage solutions business units tends to increase in periods of the year in which our customers have higher volumes of credit granting decisions most commonly the second and third calendar quarters revenues in our north america commercial business and the consumer financial marketing services business line within uscis are typically highest in the fourth quarter each year due to the timing of certain significant annual renewals of projectbased agreements on a consolidated basis combining all of these businesses and assuming normal economic conditions first quarter revenue is normally the lowest quarterly revenue of the year and the fourth quarter is the highest          45             effects of inflation and changes in foreign currency exchange rates     equifaxs operating results are not materially affected by inflation although inflation may result in increases in the companys expenses which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets and upon the value of financial instruments it may adversely affect the companys financial position and profitability     a portion of the companys business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of nonus dollar net assets revenues and expenses potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored we generally do not mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating exchange rates although we may from time to time through forward contracts or other derivative instruments hedge a portion of our translational foreign currency exposure or exchange rate risks associated with material transactions which are denominated in a foreign currency     recent accounting pronouncements     for information about new accounting pronouncements and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report     application of critical accounting policies and estimates     the companys consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap this requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made in addition while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period either of which may have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated balance sheets and statements of income we also have other significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates judgments and assumptions that are relevant to understanding our results for additional information about these policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report although we believe that our estimates assumptions and judgments are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions judgments or conditions     revenue recognition     revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists collectibility of arrangement consideration is reasonably assured the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and delivery of the product or service has been completed a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the provision of information services to our customers on a transaction basis in which case revenue is recognized assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met when the services are provided a smaller portion of our revenues relate to subscriptionbased contracts under which a customer pays a preset fee for a predetermined or unlimited number of transactions or services provided during the subscription period generally one year revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having a preset number of transactions is recognized as the services are provided using an effective transaction rate as the actual transactions are completed any remaining revenue related to unfulfilled units is not recognized until the end of the related contracts subscription period revenue related to subscriptionbased contracts having an unlimited volume is recognized ratably during the contract term revenue is recorded net of sales taxes     if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment if there is uncertainty as to the customers acceptance of our deliverables revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met          46             the determination of certain of our tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained also within our workforce solutions operating segment the fees for certain of our tax credits and incentives revenue are based on a percentage of the credit delivered to our clients revenue for these arrangements is recognized based on the achievement of milestones upon calculation of the credit or when the credit is utilized by our client depending on the provisions of the client contract     we have certain offerings that are sold as multiple element arrangements the multiple elements may include consumer or commercial information file updates for certain solutions services provided by our decisioning technologies personnel training services statistical models and other services to account for each of these elements separately the delivered elements must have standalone value to our customer if we are unable to unbundle the arrangement into separate units of accounting we apply one of the accounting policies described above this may lead to the arrangement consideration being recognized as the final contract element is delivered to our customer or ratably over the contract     many of our multiple element arrangements involve the delivery of services generated by a combination of services provided by one or more of our operating segments no individual information service impacts the value or usage of other information services included in an arrangement and each service can be sold alone or in most cases purchased from another vendor without affecting the quality of use or value to the customer of the other information services included in the arrangement some of our products require the development of interfaces or platforms by our decisioning technologies personnel that allow our customers to interact with our proprietary information databases these development services do not meet the requirement for having standalone value thus any related development fees are deferred when billed and are recognized over the expected period that the customer will benefit from the related decisioning technologies service revenue from the provision of statistical models is recognized as the service is provided and accepted assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met the direct costs of set up of a customer are capitalized and amortized as a cost of service during the term of the related customer contract     we have some multiple element arrangements that include software we recognize the elements for which we have established vendor specific objective evidence at fair value upon delivery in accordance with the applicable guidance     we record revenue on a net basis for those sales in which we have in substance acted as an agent or broker in the transaction     deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales relating generally to the deferral of subscription fees and arrangement consideration from elements not meeting the criteria for having standalone value discussed above deferred revenues are subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies     judgments and uncertainties  each element of a multiple element arrangement must be considered separately to ensure that appropriate accounting is performed for these deliverables these considerations include assessing the price at which the element is sold compared to its relative fair value concluding when the element will be delivered evaluating collectibility and determining whether any contingencies exist in the related customer contract that impact the prices paid to us for the services     in addition the determination of certain of our marketing information services and tax management services revenue requires the use of estimates principally related to transaction volumes in instances where these volumes are reported to us by our clients on a monthly basis in arrears in these instances we estimate transaction volumes based on average actual volumes reported in the past differences between our estimates and actual final volumes reported are recorded in the period in which actual volumes are reported          47             effects if actual results differ from assumptions  we have not experienced significant variances between our estimates of marketing information services and tax management services revenues reported to us by our customers and actual reported volumes in the past we monitor actual volumes to ensure that we will continue to make reasonable estimates in the future if we determine that we are unable to make reasonable future estimates revenue may be deferred until actual customer data is obtained however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions or if our customer arrangements become more complex or include more bundled offerings in the future we may be required to recognize revenue differently in the future to account for these changes we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to recognize revenue     goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets     we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually as of september 30 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance or trends competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit we have nine reporting units comprised of consumer information solutions which includes part of online consumer information solutions mortgage solutions and consumer financial marketing services identity management part of online consumer information solutions europe latin america canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services     the goodwill balance at december 31 2013 for our nine reporting units was as follows                     december 31                       2013                       in millions           consumer information solutions              9714           id management

performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing was necessary for our consumer information solutions europe canada consumer north america personal solutions north america commercial solutions verification services and employer services reporting units in this qualitative assessment we considered the following items for each of the reporting units macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions overall financial performance and other entity specific events in addition for each of these reporting units the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting units based on these assessments we determined the likelihood that a current fair value determination would be less than the current carrying amount of the reporting unit is not more likely than not as a result of our conclusions no further testing was required for these reporting units     judgments and uncertainties  in determining the fair value the id management and latin america reporting units for which we performed a quantitative test we used a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the reporting units business enterprise value          48             under the income approach we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on estimated future discounted cash flows which require assumptions about short and longterm revenue growth rates operating margins for each reporting unit discount rates foreign currency exchange rates and estimates of capital charges the assumptions we use are based on what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value under the market approach we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings before income taxes depreciation and amortization for benchmark companies we believe the benchmark companies used for each of the reporting units serve as an appropriate input for calculating a fair value for the reporting unit as those benchmark companies have similar risks participate in similar markets provide similar services for their customers and compete with us directly the companies we use as benchmarks are principally outlined in our competition discussion in item 1 of our 2013 form 10k data for the benchmark companies was obtained from publicly available information latin america and id management have benchmark companies that conduct operations of businesses of a similar type such as experian group limited and fair isaac corporation valuation multiples were selected based on a financial benchmarking analysis that compared the reporting units operating result with the comparable companies information in addition to these financial considerations qualitative factors such as variations in growth opportunities and overall risk among the benchmark companies were considered in the ultimate selection of the multiple     the values separately derived from each of the income and market approach valuation techniques were used to develop an overall estimate of a reporting units fair value we use a consistent approach across all reporting units when considering the weight of the income and market approaches for calculating the fair value of each of our reporting units this approach relies more heavily on the calculated fair value derived from the income approach with 70 of the value coming from the income approach we believe this approach is consistent with that of a market participant in valuing prospective purchase business combinations the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value     we have not made any material changes to the valuation methodology we use to assess goodwill impairment since the date of the last annual impairment test     growth assumptions     the assumptions for our future cash flows begin with our historical operating performance the details of which are described in our managements discussion amp analysis of operating performance additionally we consider the impact that known economic industry and market trends will have on our future forecasts as well as the impact that we expect from planned business initiatives including new product initiatives client service and retention standards and cost management programs at the end of the forecast period the longterm growth rate we used to determine the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3 based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of the reporting unit as well as broader economic considerations such as gdp inflation and the maturity of the markets we serve     we projected revenue growth in 2014 for our reporting units in completing our 2013 impairment testing based on planned business initiatives and prevailing trends exhibited by these units and not based on the assumption of meaningful acceleration in economic growth the anticipated revenue growth in our reporting units however is partially offset by assumed increases in expenses for a majority of our reporting units which reflect the additional level of investment needed in order to achieve the planned revenue growth our 2014 longterm forecast is not dependent upon meaningful acceleration of global economic growth in the near term and we continue to take cost containment actions to help maintain operating margins for our reporting units          49                   discount rate assumptions     we utilize a weighted average cost of capital or wacc in our impairment analysis that makes assumptions about the capital structure that we believe a market participant would make and include a risk premium based on an assessment of risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit we believe this approach yields a discount rate that is consistent with an implied rate of return that a market participant would require for an investment in a company having similar risks and business characteristics to the reporting unit being assessed to calculate the wacc the cost of equity and cost of debt are multiplied by the assumed capital structure of the reporting unit as compared to industry trends and relevant benchmark company structures the cost of equity was computed using the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate beta equity risk premium and specific company risk premium related to a particular reporting unit the cost of debt was computed using a benchmark rate and the companys tax rate for the 2013 annual goodwill impairment evaluation the discount rates used to develop the estimated fair value of the reporting units evaluated were 11 and 17 because of assigned market premiums discount rates are lowest for reporting units whose cash flows are expected to be less volatile due to such factors as the maturity of the market they serve their position in that market or other macroeconomic factors where there is the greatest volatility of cash flows due to competition or participation in less stable geographic markets than the united states such as our latin america reporting unit the discount rate selected is in the higher portion of the range as there is more inherent risk in the expected cash flows of that reporting unit     estimated fair value and sensitivities     the estimated fair value of the reporting units whose fair value was calculated for purposes of the 2013 impairment testing is derived from the valuation techniques described above incorporating the related projections and assumptions an indication of possible impairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value of its equity the estimated fair value for these reporting units exceeded their related carrying value as of september 30 2013 as a result no goodwill impairment was recorded     the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in these projections and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value for example an increase in the discount rate and decline in the projected cumulative cash flow of a reporting unit could cause the fair value of certain reporting units to be below its carrying value we perform sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values ultimately future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value the excess of fair value over carrying value for the companys reporting units that were valued as of september 30 2013 were 27 and 40     no new indications of impairment existed during the fourth quarter of 2013 thus no impairment testing was updated as of december 31 2013     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material          50             loss contingencies     we are subject to various proceedings lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of our business we determine whether to disclose andor accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable reasonably possible or remote     judgments and uncertainties  we periodically review claims and legal proceedings and assess whether we have potential financial exposure based on consultation with internal and outside legal counsel and other advisors if the likelihood of an adverse outcome from any claim or legal proceeding is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimated settlement costs if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is reasonably possible but not probable we provide disclosures related to the potential loss contingency our assumptions related to loss contingencies are inherently subjective     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies however if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates we may be exposed to a loss that could be material     income taxes     we record deferred income taxes using enacted tax laws and rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount we estimate will be recoverable     our income tax provisions are based on assumptions and calculations which will be subject to examination by various tax authorities we record tax benefits for positions in which we believe are more likely than not of being sustained under such examinations we assess the potential outcome of such examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax accruals     judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for income taxes critical because management is required to make significant judgments in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets these judgments and estimates are affected by our expectations of future taxable income mix of earnings among different taxing jurisdictions and timing of the reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities     we also use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements we review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits in light of changes in facts and circumstances such as changes in tax law interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law these adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash at december 31 2013 226 million was recorded for uncertain tax benefits including interest and penalties of which it is reasonably possible that up to 60 million of our unrecognized tax benefit may change within the next twelve months     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income tax expense that could be material     pension and other postretirement plans     we consider accounting for our us and canadian pension and other postretirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions which include discount rates expected return on plan assets interest cost and mortality and retirement rates actuarial valuations are used in determining our benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost     judgments and uncertainties  we believe that the most significant assumptions related to our net periodic benefit cost are 1 the discount rate and 2 the expected return on plan assets in each case as it relates to our us pension plan our canadian plan is small and the impact of changes in assumptions for that plan is not material          51             we determine our discount rates primarily based on highquality fixedincome investments and yieldtomaturity analysis specific to our estimated future benefit payments available as of the measurement date discount rates are updated annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions we use a third party yield curve to develop our discount rates the yield curve provides discount rates related to a dedicated highquality bond portfolio whose cash flows extend beyond the current period from which we choose a rate matched to the expected benefit payments required for each plan     the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on both our historical returns and forecasted future investment returns by asset class as provided by our external investment advisor in 2013 the us pension plan investment returns of 114 exceeded the expected return of 75 for the fourth time in the last five years the expected return for 2014 remains at 75 which is consistent with the rate used for 2013 the crip earned 135 in 2013 also exceeding its expected return of 675 for the fourth time in five years the crip has a lower expected return due to a higher asset allocation to fixed income securities our weightedaverage expected rate of return for both plans for 2014 is 743 which was also the 2013 expected rate     annual differences if any between the expected and actual returns on plan assets are included in unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss a component of other comprehensive income in calculating the annual amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss we use a marketrelated value of assets that smoothes actual investment gains and losses on plan assets over a period up to five years the resulting unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount is recognized in net periodic pension expense over the average remaining life expectancy of the participant group since almost all participants are inactive the marketrelated value of our assets was 5548 million at december 31 2013 we do not expect our 2014 net periodic benefit cost which includes the effect of the marketrelated value of assets to be materially different than our 2013 cost see note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that are used in our actuarial valuations adjusting our weightedaverage expected longterm rate of return 743 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 28 million adjusting our weightedaverage discount rate 507 at december 31 2013 by 50 basis points would change our estimated pension expense in 2014 by approximately 08 million however if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions we may be exposed to changes in pension expense that could be material     purchase accounting for acquisitions     we account for acquisitions under accounting standards codification 805 business combinations which changed the application of the acquisition method of accounting in a business combination and also modified the way assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized on a prospective basis in general the acquisition method of accounting requires companies to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition we primarily estimate fair value of identified intangible assets using discounted cash flow analyses based on market participant based inputs any amount of the purchase price paid that is in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded in the line item goodwill in our consolidated balance sheets transaction costs as well as costs to reorganize acquired companies are expensed as incurred in our consolidated statements of income     judgments and uncertainties  we consider accounting for business combinations critical because managements judgment is used to determine the estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed and amortization periods for intangible assets which can materially affect the our results of operations     effect if actual results differ from assumptions  although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable actual results could differ and we may be exposed to an impairment charge if we are unable to recover the value of the recorded net assets          52
